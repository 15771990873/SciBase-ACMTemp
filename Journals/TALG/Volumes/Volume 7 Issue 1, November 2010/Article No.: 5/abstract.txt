An (α, β)-spanner of an unweighted graphGis a subgraphHthat distorts distances inGup to a multiplicative factor of α and an additive term β. It is well known that any graph contains a (multiplicative) (2k−1, 0)-spanner of sizeO(n1+1/k) and an (additive) (1,2)-spanner of sizeO(n3/2). However no other additive spanners are known to exist.In this article we develop a couple of new techniques for constructing (α, β)-spanners. Our first result is an additive (1,6)-spanner of sizeO(n4/3). The construction algorithm can be understood as an economical agent that assignscostsandvaluesto paths in the graph,purchasingaffordable paths and ignoring expensive ones, which are intuitively well approximated by paths already purchased. We show that thispath buyingalgorithm can be parameterized in different ways to yield other sparseness-distortion tradeoffs. Our second result addresses the problem of which (α, β)-spanners can be computed efficiently, ideally in linear time. We show that, for anyk, a (k,k−1)-spanner with sizeO(kn1+1/k) can be found in linear time, and, further, that in a distributed network the algorithm terminates in a constant number of rounds. Previous spanner constructions with similar performance had roughly twice the multiplicative distortion.
