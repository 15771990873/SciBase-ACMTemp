For a given numberL, anL-length-bounded edge-cut (node-cut, respectively) in a graphGwith sourcesand sinktis a setCof edges (nodes, respectively) such that nos-t-path of length at mostLremains in the graph after removing the edges (nodes, respectively) inC. AnL-length-bounded flow is a flow that can be decomposed into flow paths of length at mostL. In contrast to classical flow theory, we describe instances for which the minimumL-length-bounded edge-cut (node-cut, respectively) is Θ(n2/3)-times (Θ(&sqrt;n)-times, respectively) larger than the maximumL-length-bounded flow, wherendenotes the number of nodes; this is the worst case. We show that the minimum length-bounded cut problem isNP-hard to approximate within a factor of 1.1377 forL≥ 5 in the case of node-cuts and forL≥ 4 in the case of edge-cuts. We also describe algorithms with approximation ratioO(min&lbrace;L,n/L&rbrace;) ⊆O&sqrt;nin the node case andO(min &lbrace;L,n2/L2,&sqrt;m&rbrace; ⊆O2/3in the edge case, wheremdenotes the number of edges. ConcerningL-length-bounded flows, we show that in graphs with unit-capacities and general edge lengths it isNP-complete to decide whether there is a fractional length-bounded flow of a given value. We analyze the structure of optimal solutions and present further complexity results.
