A set ofkballsB1, …,Bkin a Euclidean space is said to cover a collection of lines if every line intersects some ball. We consider thek-center problem for linesin high-dimensional space: Given a set ofnlinesl&equals; &lbrace;l1,…,lnin Rd, findkballs of minimum radius which coverl. We present a 2-approximation algorithm for the casesk&equals; 2, 3 of this problem, having running time quasi-linear in the number of lines and the dimension of the ambient space.Our result for 3-clustering is strongly based on a new result in discrete geometry that may be of independent interest: a Helly-type theorem for collections of axis-parallel “crosses” in the plane. The family of crosses does not have finite Helly number in the usual sense. Our Helly theorem is of a new type: it depends on ε-contracting the sets.In statistical practice, data is often incompletely specified; we consider lines as the most elementary case of incompletely specified data points. Clustering of data is a key primitive in nonparametric statistics. Our results provide a way of performing this primitive on incomplete data, as well as imputing the missing values.
