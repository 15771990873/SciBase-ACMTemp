Thegirthof a graphGis the length of a shortest cycle ofG. In this article we design anO(n5/4logn) algorithm for finding the girth of an undirectedn-vertex planar graph, the firsto(n2) algorithm for this problem. We also extend our results for the class of graphs embedded into an orientable surface of small genus. Our approach uses several techniques such as graph partitioning, hammock decomposition, graph covering, and dynamic shortest-path computation. We discuss extensions and generalizations of our result.
