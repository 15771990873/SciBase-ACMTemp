We propose and study a new class of online problems, which we callonline tracking. Suppose an observer, say Alice, observes a multivalued functionf: Z+&rightarrow; Zdover time in an online fashion, that is, she only seesf(t) fort≤tnowwheretnowis the current time. She would like to keep a tracker, say Bob, informed of the current value offat all times. Under this setting, Alice could send new values offto Bob from time to time, so that the current value offis always within a distance of Δ to the last value received by Bob. We give competitive online algorithms whose communication costs are compared with the optimal offline algorithm that knows the entirefin advance. We also consider variations of the problem where Alice is allowed to send predictions to Bob, to further reduce communication for well-behaved functions. These online tracking problems have a variety of application, ranging from sensor monitoring, location-based services, to publish/subscribe systems.
