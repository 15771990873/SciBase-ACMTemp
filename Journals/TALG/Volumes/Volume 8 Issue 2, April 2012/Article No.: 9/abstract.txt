We introduce a generalization of interval graphs, which we call Dotted Interval Graphs (DIG). A dotted interval graph is an intersection graph of arithmetic progressions (dotted intervals). Coloring of dotted interval graphs naturally arises in the context of high throughput genotyping. We study the properties of dotted interval graphs, with a focus on coloring. We show that any graph is a DIG, but thatDIGdgraphs, that is, DIGs in which the arithmetic progressions have a jump of at mostd, form a strict hierarchy. We show that coloringDIGdgraphs is NP-complete even ford= 2. For any fixedd, we provide a 5/6d+o(d) approximation for the coloring ofDIGdgraphs. Finally, we show that finding the maximal clique inDIGdgraphs is fixed parameter tractable ind.
