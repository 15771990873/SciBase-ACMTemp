In this article we study graphs with inductive neighborhood properties. LetPbe a graph property, a graphG= (V, E) withnvertices is said to have an inductive neighborhood property with respect toPif there is an ordering of verticesv1, &dots;,vnsuch that the propertyPholds on the induced subgraphG[N(vi)âˆ©Vi], whereN(vi) is the neighborhood ofviandVi= {vi, &dots;,vn}. It turns out that if we takePas a graph with maximum independent set size no greater thank, then this definition gives a natural generalization of both chordal graphs and (k+ 1)-claw-free graphs. We refer to such graphs as inductivek-independent graphs. We study properties of such families of graphs, and we show that several natural classes of graphs are inductivek-independent for smallk. In particular, any intersection graph of translates of a convex object in a two dimensional plane is an inductive3-independent graph; furthermore, any planar graph is an inductive3-independent graph. For any fixed constantk, we develop simple, polynomial time approximation algorithms for inductivek-independent graphs with respect to several well-studied NP-complete problems. Our generalized formulation unifies and extends several previously known results.
