Theminimum cost-tree coverproblem is to compute a minimum cost-treeTin a given connected graphGwith costs on the edges, such that the vertices spanned byTform a vertex cover forG. The problem is supposed to occur in applications of vertex cover and in edge-dominating sets when additional connectivity is required for solutions. Whereas a linear-time2-approximation algorithm for the unweighted case has been known for quite a while, the best approximation ratio known for the weighted case is3. Moreover, the3-approximation algorithms for such cases are far from practical due to their inefficiency.In this article we present a fast, purely combinatorial2-approximation algorithm for the minimum cost-tree cover problem. It constructs a good approximate solution by trimming some leaves within a minimum spanning tree (MST); and, to determine which leaves to trim, it uses both the primal-dual schema and an instance layering technique adapted from the local ratio method.
