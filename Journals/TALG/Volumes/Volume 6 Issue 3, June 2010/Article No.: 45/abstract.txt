We show how to construct anexplicitHamilton cycle in the directed Cayley graph &Cayrarr;({σn, σn−1}: Sn), where σkis the rotation (1 2 &cdots;k). The existence of such cycles was shown by Jackson [1996] but the proof only shows that a certain directed graph is Eulerian, and Knuth [2005] asks for an explicit construction. We show that a simple recursion describes our Hamilton cycle and that the cycle can be generated by an iterative algorithm that usesO(n) space. Moreover, the algorithm produces each successive edge of the cycle in constant time; such algorithms are said to beloopless. Finally, our Hamilton cycle can be used to construct an explicit universal cycle for the (n−1)-permutations of an-set, or as the basis of an efficient algorithm for generating everyn-permutation of ann-set within a circular array or linked list.
