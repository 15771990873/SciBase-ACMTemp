Given a rectangular boundary partitioned into rectangles, the Minimum-Length Corridor (MLC-R) problem consists of finding a corridor of least total length. A corridor is a set of connected line segments, each of which must lie along the line segments that form the rectangular boundary and/or the boundary of the rectangles, and must include at least one point from the boundary of every rectangle and from the rectangular boundary. The MLC-R problem is known to be NP-hard. We present the first polynomial-time constant ratio approximation algorithm for the MLC-R and MLCkproblems. The MLCkproblem is a generalization of the MLC-R problem where the rectangles are rectilinearc-gons, forcâ‰¤kandkis a constant. We also present the first polynomial-time constant ratio approximation algorithm for the Group Traveling Salesperson Problem (GTSP) for a rectangular boundary partitioned into rectilinearc-gons as in the MLCkproblem. Our algorithms are based on the restriction and relaxation approximation techniques.
