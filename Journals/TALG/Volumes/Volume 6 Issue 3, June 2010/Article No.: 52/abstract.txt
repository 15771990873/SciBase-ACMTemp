In this article we study the problem of approximating the distance of a functionf: [n]d→Rto monotonicity where [n] &equals; {1,&ldots;,n} andRis some fully ordered range. Namely, we are interested in randomized sublinear algorithms that approximate the Hamming distance between a given function and the closest monotone function. We allow both an additive error, parameterized by δ, and a multiplicative error.Previous work on distance approximation to monotonicity focused on the one-dimensional case and the only explicit extension to higher dimensions was with a multiplicative approximation factor exponential in the dimensiond. Building on Goldreich et al. [2000] and Dodis et al. [1999], in which there are better implicit results for the casen&equals;2, we describe a reduction from the case of functions over thed-dimensional hypercube [n]dto the case of functions over thek-dimensional hypercube [n]k, where 1≤k≤d. The quality of estimation that this reduction provides is linear in ⌈d/k⌉ and logarithmic in the size of the range &vert;R&vert; (if the range is infinite or just very large, then log &vert;R&vert; can be replaced bydlogn). Using this reduction and a known distance approximation algorithm for the one-dimensional case, we obtain a distance approximation algorithm for functions over thed-dimensional hypercube, with any rangeR, which has a multiplicative approximation factor ofO(dlog &vert;R&vert;).For the case of a binary range, we present algorithms for distance approximation to monotonicity of functions over one dimension, two dimensions, and thek-dimensional hypercube (for anyk≥ 1). Applying these algorithms and the reduction described before, we obtain a variety of distance approximation algorithms for Boolean functions over thed-dimensional hypercube which suggest a trade-off between quality of estimation and efficiency of computation. In particular, the multiplicative error ranges betweenO(d) andO(1).
