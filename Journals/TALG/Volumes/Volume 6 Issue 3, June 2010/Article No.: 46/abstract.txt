We present anO(&sqrt;opt)-approximation algorithm for the maximum leaf spanning arborescence problem, where opt is the number of leaves in an optimal spanning arborescence. The result is based upon anO(1)-approximation algorithm for a special class of directed graphs called willows. Incorporating the method for willow graphs as a subroutine in a local improvement algorithm gives the bound for general directed graphs.
