We consider the following simple algorithm for feedback arc set problem in weighted tournaments: order the vertices by their weighted indegrees. We show that this algorithm has an approximation guarantee of 5 if the weights satisfyprobability constraints(for any pair of verticesuandv,wuv+wvu&equals;1). Special cases of the feedback arc set problem in such weighted tournaments include the feedback arc set problem in unweighted tournaments and rank aggregation. To complement the upper bound, for any constant &epsi;>0, we exhibit an infinite family of (unweighted) tournaments for which the aforesaid algorithm (irrespectiveof how ties are broken) has an approximation ratio of 5-&epsi;.
