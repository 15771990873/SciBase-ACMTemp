For a graphGwith real weights assigned to the vertices (edges), the MAXH-SUBGRAPH problem is to find anH-subgraph ofGwith maximum total weight, if one exists. Our main results are new strongly polynomial algorithms for the MAXH-SUBGRAPH problem. Some of our algorithms are based, in part, on fast matrix multiplication.For vertex-weighted graphs withnvertices we solve a more general problem: theall pairsMAXH-SUBGRAPH problem, where the task is to find for every pair of verticesu,v,a maximumH-subgraph containing bothuandv, if one exists. We obtain anO(nt(ω,h))-time algorithm for theall pairsMAXH-SUBGRAPH problem in the case whereHis a fixed graph withhvertices andω< 2.376 is the exponent of matrix multiplication. The value oft(ω,h) is determined by solving a small integer program. In particular, heaviest triangles for all pairs can be found inO(n2+1/(4-ω)) ≤o(n2.616)-time. Forh&equals;4,5,8 the running time of our algorithm essentially matches that of the (unweighted)H-subgraph detection problem. Using rectangular matrix multiplication, the value oft(ω,h) can be improved; for example, the runtime for triangles becomesO(n2.575).We also present improved algorithms for the MAXH-SUBGRAPH problem in the edge-weighted case. In particular, we obtain anO(m2−1/klogn)-time algorithm for the heaviest cycle of length 2kor 2k−1 in a graph withmedges and anO(n3/logn)-time randomized algorithm for finding the heaviest cycle of any fixed length.Our methods also yield efficient algorithms for several related problems that are faster than any previously existing algorithms. For example, we show how to find chromaticH-subgraphs in edge-colored graphs, and how to compute the most significant bits of the distance product of two real matrices, in truly subcubic time.
