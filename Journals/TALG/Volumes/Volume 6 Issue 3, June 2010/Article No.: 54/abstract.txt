The construction of perfect hash functions is a well-studied topic. In this article, this concept is generalized with the following definition. We say that a family of functions from [n] to [k] is a δ-balanced (n,k)-family of perfect hash functions if for everyS⊆ [n], &vert;S&vert;&equals;k, the number of functions that are 1-1 onSis betweenT/δ and δTfor some constantT>0. The standard definition of a family of perfect hash functions requires that there will be at least one function that is 1-1 onS, for eachSof sizek. In the new notion of balanced families, we require the number of 1-1 functions to be almost the same (taking δ to be close to 1) for every suchS. Our main result is that for any constant δ > 1, a δ-balanced (n,k)-family of perfect hash functions of size 2O(klog logk)logncan be constructed in time 2O(klog logk)nlogn. Using the technique of color-coding we can apply our explicit constructions to devise approximation algorithms for various counting problems in graphs. In particular, we exhibit a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for approximating both the number of simple paths of lengthkand the number of simple cycles of sizekfor anyk≤O(logn/log log logn) in a graph withnvertices. The approximation is up to any fixed desirable relative error.
