We describe a simple algorithm for approximating the empirical entropy of a stream ofmvalues up to a multiplicative factor of (1+&epsi;) using a single pass,O(&epsi;−2log (δ−1) logm) words of space, andO(log &epsi;−1+ log log δ−1+ log logm) processing time per item in the stream. Our algorithm is based upon a novel extension of a method introduced by Alon et al. [1999]. This improves over previous work on this problem. We show a space lower bound of Ω(&epsi;−2/log2(&epsi;−1)), demonstrating that our algorithm is near-optimal in terms of its dependency on &epsi;.We show that generalizing to multiplicative-approximation of thekth-order entropy requires close to linear space fork≥1. In contrast we show that additive-approximation is possible in a single pass using only poly-logarithmic space. Lastly, we show how to compute a multiplicative approximation to the entropy of a random walk on an undirected graph.
