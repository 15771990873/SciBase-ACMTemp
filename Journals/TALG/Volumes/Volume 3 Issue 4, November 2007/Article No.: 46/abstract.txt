The approximability of the maximum edge-disjoint paths problem (EDP) in directed graphs was seemingly settled by an Ω(m1/2− &epsis;)-hardness result of Guruswami et al. [2003], and anO(&sqrt;m) approximation achievable via a natural multicommodity-flow-based LP relaxation as well as a greedy algorithm. Heremis the number of edges in the graph. We observe that the Ω(m1/2− &epsis;)-hardness of approximation applies tosparsegraphs, and hence when expressed as a function ofn, that is, the number of vertices, only an Ω(n1/2− &epsis;)-hardness follows. On the other hand,O(&sqrt;m)-approximation algorithms do not guarantee asublinear(in terms ofn) approximation algorithm fordensegraphs. We note that a similar gap exists in the known results on the integrality gap of the flow-based LP relaxation: an Ω(&sqrt;n) lower bound andO(&sqrt;m) upper bound. Motivated by this discrepancy in the upper and lower bounds, we study algorithms for EDP in directed and undirected graphs and obtain improved approximation ratios. We show that the greedy algorithm has an approximation ratio ofO(min(n2/3, &sqrt;m)) in undirected graphs and a ratio ofO(min(n4/5, &sqrt;m)) in directed graphs. For acyclic graphs we give anO(&sqrt;nlnn) approximation via LP rounding. These are the first sublinear approximation ratios for EDP. The results also extend to EDP with weights and to the uniform-capacity unsplittable flow problem (UCUFP).
