Given an undirected graphG(V,E) with terminal setT⊆V, the problem of packing element-disjoint Steiner trees is to find the maximum number of Steiner trees that are disjoint on the nonterminal nodes and on the edges. The problem is known to be NP-hard to approximate within a factor of Ω(logn), wherendenotes &verbar;V&verbar;. We present a randomizedO(logn)-approximation algorithm for this problem, thus matching the hardness lower bound. Moreover, we show a tight upper bound ofO(logn) on the integrality ratio of a natural linear programming relaxation.
