Andersson and Nilsson introduced in 1993 alevel-compressed trie(for short, LC trie) in which a full subtree of a node is compressed to a single node of degree being the size of the subtree. Recent experimental results indicated a “dramatic improvement” when full subtrees are replaced by “partially filled subtrees.” In this article, we provide a theoretical justification of these experimental results, showing, among others, a rather moderate improvement in search time over the original LC tries. For such an analysis, we assume thatnstrings are generated independently by a binary memoryless source, withpdenoting the probability of emitting a “1” (andq&equals; 1 −p). We first prove that the so-called α-fillup levelFn(α) (i.e., the largest level in a trie with α fraction of nodes present at this level) is concentrated on two values with high probability: eitherFn(α) &equals;knorFn(α) &equals;kn&plus; 1, wherekn&equals; log1/&sqrt;pqn− &verbar;ln (p/q)&verbar;/2 ln3/2(1&sqrt;pq) Φ−1(α) &sqrt; lnn&plus;O(1) is an integer and Φ(x) denotes the normal distribution function. This result directly yields the typical depth (search time)Dn(α) in the α-LC tries, namely, we show that with high probabilityDn(α) ∼C2log logn, whereC2&equals; 1/&verbar;log(1 −h/log(1/&sqrt;pq))&verbar; forp≠qandh&equals; −plogp−qlogqis the Shannon entropy rate. This should be compared with recently found typical depth in the original LC tries, which isC1log logn, whereC1&equals; 1/&verbar;log(1−h/log(1/min&lcub;p, 1−p&rcub;))&verbar;. In conclusion, we observe that α affects only the lower term of the α-fillup levelFn(α), and the search time in α-LC tries is of the same order as in the original LC tries.
