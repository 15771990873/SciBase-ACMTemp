We consider the guessing secrets problem defined by Chung et al. [2001]. This is a variant of the standard 20 questions game where the player has a set ofk> 1 secrets from a universe ofNpossible secrets. The player is asked Boolean questions about the secret. For each question, the player picks one of theksecrets adversarially, and answers according to this secret.We present an explicit set ofO(logN) questions together with an efficient (i.e., poly(logN) time) algorithm to solve the guessing secrets problem for the case of 2 secrets. This answers the main algorithmic question left unanswered by Chung et al. [2001]. The main techniques we use are small&epsis;-biased spacesand the notion oflist decoding.We also establish bounds on the number of questions needed to solve thek-secrets game fork> 2, and discuss how list decoding can be used to get partial information about the secrets, specifically to find a small core of secrets that must intersect the actual set ofksecrets.
