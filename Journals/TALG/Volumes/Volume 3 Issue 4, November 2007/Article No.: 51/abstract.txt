Oblivious routing algorithms for general undirected networks were introduced by Räcke [2002], and this work has led to many subsequent improvements and applications. Comparatively little is known about oblivious routing in generaldirectednetworks, or even in undirected networks with node capacities.We present the first nontrivial upper bounds for both these cases, providing algorithms fork-commodity oblivious routing problems with competitive ratioO(&sqrt;klog(n)) for undirected node-capacitated graphs andO(&sqrt;kn1/4log(n)) for directed graphs. In the special case that all commodities have a common source or sink, our upper bound becomesO(&sqrt;nlog(n)) in both cases, matching the lower bound up to a factor of log(n). The lower bound (which first appeared in Azar et al. [2003]) is obtained on a graph with very high degree. We show that, in fact, the degree of a graph is a crucial parameter for node-capacitated oblivious routing in undirected graphs, by providing anO(Δ polylog(n))-competitive oblivious routing scheme for graphs of degree Δ. For the directed case, however, we show that the lower bound of Ω(&sqrt;n) still holds in low-degree graphs.Finally, we settle an open question about routing problems in which all commodities share a common source or sink. We show that even in this simplified scenario there are networks in which no oblivious routing algorithm can achieve a competitive ratio better than Ω(logn).
