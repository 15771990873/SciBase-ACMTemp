We consider theindexable dictionaryproblem, which consists of storing a setS⊆ &lcub;0,…,m− 1&rcub; for some integermwhile supporting the operations of rank(x), which returns the number of elements inSthat are less thanxifx∈S, and −1 otherwise; and select(i), which returns theith smallest element inS. We give a data structure that supports both operations inO(1) time on the RAM model and requires B(n, m) &plus;o(n) &plus;O(lg lgm) bits to store a set of sizen, where B(n, m) &equals; ⌊lg (m/n)⌋ is the minimum number of bits required to store anyn-element subset from a universe of sizem. Previous dictionaries taking this space only supported (yes/no) membership queries inO(1) time. In the cell probe model we can remove theO(lg lgm) additive term in the space bound, answering a question raised by Fich and Miltersen [1995] and Pagh [2001].We present extensions and applications of our indexable dictionary data structure, including:—an information-theoretically optimal representation of ak-ary cardinal tree that supports standard operations in constant time;—a representation of a multiset of sizenfrom &lcub;0,…,m− 1&rcub; in B(n, m&plus;n) &plus;o(n) bits that supports (appropriate generalizations of) rank and select operations in constant time; and &plus;O(lg lgm)—a representation of a sequence ofnnonnegative integers summing up tomin B(n, m&plus;n) &plus;o(n) bits that supports prefix sum queries in constant time.
