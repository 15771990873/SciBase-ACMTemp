We consider the following buffer management problem arising in QoS networks: Packets with specified weights and deadlines arrive at a network switch and need to be forwarded so that the total weight of forwarded packets is maximized. Packets not forwarded before their deadlines are lost. The main result of the article is an online 64/33 &ap; 1.939-competitive algorithm, the first deterministic algorithm for this problem with competitive ratio below 2. For the 2-uniform case we give an algorithm with ratio &ap; 1.377 and a matching lower bound.
