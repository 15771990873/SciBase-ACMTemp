Thecycle packing numberνe(G) of a graphGis the maximum number of pairwise edge-disjoint cycles inG. Computing νe(G) is an NP-hard problem. We present approximation algorithms for computing νe(G) in both undirected and directed graphs. In the undirected case we analyze a variant of the modified greedy algorithm suggested by Caprara et al. [2003] and show that it has approximation ratio Θ(&sqrt;logn), wheren&equals; &verbar;V(G)&verbar;. This improves upon the previousO(logn) upper bound for the approximation ratio of this algorithm. In the directed case we present a &sqrt;n-approximation algorithm. Finally, we give anO(n2/3)-approximation algorithm for the problem of finding a maximum number of edge-disjoint cycles that intersect a specified subsetSof vertices. We also study generalizations of these problems. Our approximation ratios are the currently best-known ones and, in addition, provide upper bounds on theintegrality gapof standard LP-relaxations of these problems. In addition, we give lower bounds for the integrality gap and approximability of νe(G) in directed graphs. Specifically, we prove a lower bound of Ω(logn/loglogn) for the integrality gap of edge-disjoint cycle packing. We also show that it is quasi-NP-hard to approximate νe(G) within a factor ofO(log1− &epsiv;n) for any constant &epsiv; > 0. This improves upon the previously known APX-hardness result for this problem.
