We consider the problem of scheduling a set ofnunit-execution-time (UET) tasks, with precedence constraints, onm≥ 1 parallel and identical processors so as to minimize the mean flow time. For two processors, the Coffman--Graham algorithm gives a schedule that simultaneously minimizes the mean flow time and the makespan. The problem becomes strongly NP-hard for an arbitrary number of processors, although the complexity is not known for each fixedm≥ 3. For arbitrary precedence constraints, we show that the Coffman--Graham algorithm gives a schedule with a worst-case bound no more than 2, and we give examples showing that the bound is tight. For intrees, the problem can be solved in polynomial time for each fixedm≥ 1, although the complexity is not known for an arbitrary number of processors. We show that Hu's algorithm (which is optimal for the makespan objective) yields a schedule with a worst-case bound no more than 1.5, and we give examples showing that the ratio can approach 1.308999.
