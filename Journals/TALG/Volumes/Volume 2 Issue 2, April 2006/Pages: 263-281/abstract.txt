Consider a graph problem which is associated with a parameter, for example, that of finding a longest tour spanningkvertices. The following question is natural: Is there a small subgraph that contains an optimal or near optimal solution for every possible value of the given parameter? Such a subgraph is said to berobust. In this article we consider the problems of finding heavy paths and heavy trees ofkedges. In these two cases, we prove surprising bounds on the size of a robust subgraph for a variety of approximation ratios. For both problems, we show that in every complete weighted graph onnvertices there exists a subgraph with approximately α/1−α2nedges that contains an α-approximate solution for everyk&equals; 1,…,n− 1. In the analysis of the tree problem, we also describe a new result regarding balanced decomposition of trees. In addition, we consider variants in which the subgraph itself is restricted to be a path or a tree. For these problems, we describe polynomial time algorithms and corresponding proofs of negative results.
