The problem of maximizing the weighted throughput in various switching settings has been intensively studied recently through competitive analysis. To date, the most general model that has been investigated is the standard CIOQ (Combined Input and Output Queued) switch architecture with internal fabric speedupS≥ 1. CIOQ switches, that comprise the backbone of packet routing networks, areN×Nswitches controlled by a switching policy that incorporates two components: Admission control and scheduling. An admission control strategy is essential to determine the packets stored in the FIFO queues in input and output ports, while the scheduling policy conducts the transfer of packets through the internal fabric, from input ports to output ports. The online problem of maximizing the total weighted throughput of CIOQ switches was recently investigated by Kesselman and Rosén [2003]. They presented two different online algorithms for the general problem that achieve non-constant competitive ratios (linear in either the speedup or the number of distinct values, or logarithmic in the value range). We introduce the first constant-competitive algorithm for the general case of the problem, with arbitrary speedup and packet values. Specifically, our algorithm is 8-competitive, and is also simple and easy to implement.
