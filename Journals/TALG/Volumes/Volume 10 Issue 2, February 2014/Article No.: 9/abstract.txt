We study an energy conservation problem where a variable-speed processor is equipped with a sleep state. Executing jobs at high speeds and then setting the processor asleep is an approach that can lead to further energy savings compared to standard dynamic speed scaling. We consider classical deadline-based scheduling, that is, each job is specified by a release time, a deadline and a processing volume. For general convex power functions, Irani et al. [2007] devised an offline 2-approximation algorithm. Roughly speaking, the algorithm schedules jobs at a critical speedscritthat yields the smallest energy consumption while jobs are processed. For power functionsP(s) =sα& γ, wheresis the processor speed, Han et al. [2010] gave an αα&plus; 2)-competitive online algorithm.We investigate the offline setting of speed scaling with a sleep state. First, we prove NP-hardness of the optimization problem. Additionally, we develop lower bounds, for general convex power functions: No algorithm that constructsscrit-schedules, which execute jobs at speeds of at leastscrit, can achieve an approximation factor smaller than 2. Furthermore, no algorithm that minimizes the energy expended for processing jobs can attain an approximation ratio smaller than 2.We then present an algorithmic framework for designing good approximation algorithms. For general convex power functions, we derive an approximation factor of 4/3. For power functionsP(s) = βsα&plus; γ, we obtain an approximation of 137/117 > 1.171. We finally show that our framework yields the best approximation guarantees for the class ofscrit-schedules. For general convex power functions, we give another 2-approximation algorithm. For functionsP(s) = βsα&plus; γ, we present tight upper and lower bounds on the best possible approximation factor. The ratio is exactlyeW−1(−e−1−1/e)/(eW−1(−e−1−1/e)&plus;1)> 1.211, whereW-1is the lower branch of the LambertWfunction.
