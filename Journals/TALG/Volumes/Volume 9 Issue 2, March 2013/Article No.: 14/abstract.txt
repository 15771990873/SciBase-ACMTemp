Adistance sensitivity oracleof ann-vertex graphG= (V,E) is a data structure that can report shortest paths when edges of the graph fail. A query (u∈V,v∈V,S⊆E) to this oracle returns a shortestu-to-vpath in the graphG′= (V,E&setmn;S). We present randomized (Monte Carlo) algorithms for constructing a distance sensitivity oracle of sizeÕ(n3−α) for |S| =O(lgn/lg lgn) and any choice of 0 <α< 1. For real edge-lengths, the oracle is constructed inO(n4−α) time and a query to this oracle takesÕ(n2−2(1−α)/|S|) time. For integral edge-lengths in {−M,...,M}, using the currentω< 2.376 matrix multiplication exponent, the oracle is constructed inO(Mn3.376−α) time withÕ(n2−(1−α)/|S|) query, or alternatively inO(M0.681n3.575−α) time withÕ(n2−2(1−α)/|S|) query.Distance sensitivity oracles generalize thereplacement pathsproblem in whichuandvare known in advance and |S| = 1. In other words, ifPis a shortest path fromutovinG, then the replacement paths problem asks to compute, for every edgeeonP, a shortestu-to-vpath that avoidse. Our new technique for constructing distance sensitivity oracles using fast matrix multiplication also yields the first subcubic-time algorithm for the replacement paths problem when the edge-lengths are small integers. In particular, it yields a randomized (Monte Carlo)Õ(Mn2.376+M2 3n2.584)-time algorithm for the replacement paths problem assumingM≤n0.624.Finally, we mention that both our replacement paths algorithm and our distance sensitivity oracle can be made to work, in the same time and space bounds, for the case of failed vertices rather than edges, that is, whenSis a set of vertices and we seek a shortestu-to-vpath in the graph obtained fromGby removing all vertices inSand their adjacent edges.
