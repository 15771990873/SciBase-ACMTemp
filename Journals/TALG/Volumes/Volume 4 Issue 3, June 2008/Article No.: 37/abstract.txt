Given a weighted undirected network with arbitrary node names, we present a compact routing scheme, using aÕ(&sqrt;n,) space routing table at each node, and routing along paths of stretch 3, that is, at most thrice as long as the minimum cost paths. This is optimal in a very strong sense. It is known that no compact routing usingo(n) space per node can route with stretch below 3. Also, it is known that any stretch below 5 requires Ω(&sqrt;n,)space per node.
