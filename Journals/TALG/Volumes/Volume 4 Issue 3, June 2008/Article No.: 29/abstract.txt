We introduce the notion ofroundtrip-spannersof weighteddirectedgraphs and describe efficient algorithms for their construction. We show that for every integerk≥ 1 and any &epsi; > 0, any directed graph onnvertices with edge weights in the range [1,W] has a (2k+ &epsi;)-roundtrip-spanner withO(min{(k2/&epsi;)n1 + 1/k(log(nW), (k/&epsi;)2n1 + 1/k,(logn)2−1/k}) edges. We then extend these constructions and obtain compact roundtrip routing schemes. For every integerk≥ 1 and every &epsi; > 0, we describe a roundtrip routing scheme that has stretch 4k+ &epsi;, and uses at each vertex a routing table of sizeÕ((k2/&epsi;)n1/klog(nW)). We also show that any weighted directed graph witharbitrary/positive edge weights has a 3-roundtrip-spanner withO(n3/2) edges. This result is optimal. Finally, we present a stretch 3 roundtrip routing scheme that uses local routing tables of sizeÕ(n1/2). This routing scheme is essentially optimal. The roundtrip-spanner constructions and the roundtrip routing schemes for directed graphs that we describe are only slightly worse than the best available spanners and routing schemes for undirected graphs. Our roundtrip routing schemes substantially improve previous results of Cowen and Wagner. Our results are obtained by combining ideas of Cohen, Cowen and Wagner, Thorup and Zwick, with some new ideas.
