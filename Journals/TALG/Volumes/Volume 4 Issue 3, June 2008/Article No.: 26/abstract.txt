Given a set ofnelements, each of which is colored one ofccolors, we must determine an element of the plurality (most frequently occurring) color by pairwise equal/unequal color comparisons of elements. We prove that (c− 1)(n−c)/2 color comparisons are necessary in the worst case to determine the plurality color and give an algorithm requiring (0.775c+ 5.9)n+O(c2) color comparisons forc≥ 9.
