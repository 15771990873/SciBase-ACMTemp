We consider the speed scaling problem of minimizing the average response time of a collection of dynamically released jobs subject to a constraintAon energy used. We propose an algorithmic approach in which an energy optimal schedule is computed for a hugeA, and then the energy optimal schedule is maintained asAdecreases. We show that this approach yields an efficient algorithm for equi-work jobs. We note that the energy optimal schedule has the surprising feature that the job speeds are not monotone functions of the available energy. We then explain why this algorithmic approach is problematic for arbitrary work jobs. Finally, we explain how to use the algorithm for equi-work jobs to obtain an algorithm for arbitrary work jobs that isO(1)-approximate with respect to average response time, given an additional factor of (1 + &epsi;) energy.
