In this article, efficient algorithms are presented for the minmax-regret 1-center and 1-median problems on a general graph and a tree with uncertain vertex weights. For the minmax-regret 1-center problem on a general graph, we improve the previous upper bound fromO(mn2logn) toO(mnlogn). For the problem on a tree, we improve the upper bound fromO(n2) toO(nlog2n). For the minmax-regret 1-median problem on a general graph, we improve the upper bound fromO(mn2logn) toO(mn2+n3logn). For the problem on a tree, we improve the upper bound fromO(nlog2n) toO(nlogn).
