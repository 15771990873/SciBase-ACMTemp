Clustering method is one of the most important tools in statistics. In a graph theory model, clustering is the process of finding all dense subgraphs. A mathematically well-defined measure for graph density is introduced in this article as follows. LetG&equals; (V,E) be a graph (or multi-graph) andHbe a subgraph ofG. The dynamic density ofHis the greatest integerksuch that min∀P{&verbar;E(H/P)&verbar;/&verbar;V(H/P)&verbar; − 1} >kwhere the minimum is taken over all possible partitionsPof the vertex set ofH, andH/Pis the graph obtained fromHby contracting each part ofPinto a single vertex. A subgraphHofGis a level-kcommunity ifHis a maximal subgraph ofGwith dynamic density at leastk. An algorithm is designed in this paper to detect all level-hcommunities of an input multi-graphG. The worst-case complexity of this algorithm is upper bounded byO(&verbar;V(G)&verbar;2h2). This new method is one of few available clustering methods that are mathematically well-defined, supported by rigorous mathematical proof and able to achieve the optimization goal with polynomial complexity. As a byproduct, this algorithm also can be applied for finding edge-disjoint spanning trees of a multi-graph. The worst-case complexity is lower than all known algorithms for multi-graphs.
