Given a Euclidean graphGover a setPofnpoints in the plane, we are interested in verifying whetherGis a Euclidean minimum spanning tree (EMST) ofPorGdiffers from it in more than &epsi;nedges. We assume thatGis given in adjacency list representation and the point/vertex setPis given in an array. We present a property testing algorithm that accepts graphGif it is an EMST ofPand that rejects with probability at least 2/3 ifGdiffers from every EMST ofPin more than &epsi;,nedges. Our algorithm runs in O(&sqrt;n/&epsi; ⋅ log2(n/&epsi;)) time and has a query complexity of O(&sqrt;n/&epsi; ⋅ log (n/&epsi;)).
