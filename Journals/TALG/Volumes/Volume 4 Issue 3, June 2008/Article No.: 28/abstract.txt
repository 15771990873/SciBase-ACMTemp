Anordinal treeis an arbitrary rooted tree where the children of each node are ordered. Succinct representations for ordinal trees with efficient query support have been extensively studied. The best previously known result is due to Geary et al. [2004b, pages 1--10]. The number of bits required by their representation for ann-node ordinal treeTis 2n+o(n), whose first-order term is information-theoretically optimal. Their representation supports a large set ofO(1)-time queries onT. Based upon a balanced string of 2nparentheses, we give an improved 2n+o(n)-bit representation forT. Our improvement is two-fold: First, the set ofO(1)-time queries supported by our representation is a proper superset of that supported by the representation of Geary, Raman, and Raman. Second, it is also much easier for our representation to support new queries by simply adding new auxiliary strings.
