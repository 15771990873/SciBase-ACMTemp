Given a set ofnelements, each of which is colored one ofc≥ 2 colors, we have to determine an element of the plurality (most frequently occurring) color by pairwise equal/unequal color comparisons of elements. We derive lower bounds for the expected number of color comparisons when thecncolorings are equally probable. We prove a general lower bound ofc/3n−O(&sqrt;n) forc≥ 2; we prove the stronger particular bounds of 7/6n−O(&sqrt;n) forc&equals; 3, 54/35n−O(&sqrt;n) forc&equals; 4, 607/315n−O(&sqrt;n) forc&equals; 5, 1592/693n−O(&sqrt;n) forc&equals; 6, 7985/3003n−O(&sqrt;n) forc&equals; 7, and 19402/6435n−O(&sqrt;n) forc&equals; 8.
