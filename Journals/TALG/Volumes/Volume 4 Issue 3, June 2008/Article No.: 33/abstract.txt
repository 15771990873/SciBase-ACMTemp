The problem of performingntasks onpasynchronous or undependable processors is a basic problem in distributed computing. This article considers an abstraction of this problem calledWrite-All: using p processors write 1's into all locations of an array of size n. In this problem writing 1 abstracts the notion of performing a simple task. Despite substantial research, there is a dearth of efficient deterministic asynchronous algorithms forWrite-All/. Efficiency of algorithms is measured in terms ofworkthat accounts for all local steps performed by the processors in solving the problem. Thus, an optimal algorithm would have work Θ(n), however it is known that optimality cannot be achieved whenp&equals; Ω(n). The quest then is to obtain work-optimal solutions for this problem using a nontrivial, compared ton, number of processorsp. The algorithm presented in this article has work complexity ofO(n+p2 + &epsi;), and it achieves work optimality forp&equals;O(n1/(2 + &epsiv;)) for any &epsiv; > 0, while the previous best result achieved optimality forp≤4&sqrt;n/logn. Additionally, the new result usesonlythe atomic read/write memory, without resorting to using the test-and-set primitive that was necessary in the previous solution.
