We revisit the all-pairs-shortest-paths problem for an unweighted undirected graph withnvertices andmedges. We present new algorithms with the following running times:&lcub;O(mn/logn) ifm>nlognlog log lognO(mnlog logn/logn) ifm>nlog lognO(n2log2logn/logn) ifmâ‰¤nlog logn.These represent the best time bounds known for the problem for allm&Lt;n1.376. We also obtain a similar type of result for the diameter problem for unweighted directed graphs.
