Spanner of an undirected graphG= (V,E) is a subgraph that is sparse and yet preserves all-pairs distances approximately. More formally, a spanner withstretcht∈ &Nopf; is a subgraph (V,ES),ES⊆Esuch that the distance between any two vertices in the subgraph is at mostttimes their distance inG. ThoughGis trivially at-spanner of itself, the research as well as applications of spanners invariably deal with at-spanner that has as small number of edges as possible.We present fully dynamic algorithms for maintaining spanners in centralized as well as synchronized distributed environments. These algorithms are designed for undirected unweighted graphs and use randomization in a crucial manner.Our algorithms significantly improve the existing fully dynamic algorithms for graph spanners. The expected size (number of edges) of at-spanner maintained at each stage by our algorithms matches, up to a polylogarithmic factor, the worst case optimal size of at-spanner. The expected amortized time (or messages communicated in distributed environment) to process a single insertion/deletion of an edge by our algorithms iscloseto optimal.
