Various methods have been used to represent a tree onnnodes in essentially the information-theoretic minimum space while supporting various navigational operations in constant time, but different representations usually support different operations. Our main contribution is a succinct representation of ordinal trees, based on that of Geary et al. [2006], that supports all the navigational operations supported by various succinct tree representations while requiring only 2n+o(n) bits. It also supports efficient level-order traversal, a useful ordering previously supported only with a very limited set of operations.Our second contribution expands on the notion of a single succinct representation supporting more than one traversal ordering, by showing that our method supports two other encoding schemes as abstract data types. In particular, it supports extracting a word (O(lgn) bits) of the balanced parenthesis sequence or depth first unary degree sequence inO(f(n)) time, using at mostn/f(n)+o(n) additional bits, for anyf(n) inO(lgn) and Î©(1).
