Thek-Leaf Out-Branching problem is to find an out-branching, that is a rooted oriented spanning tree, with at leastkleaves in a given digraph. The problem has recently received much attention from the viewpoint of parameterized algorithms. Here, we take a kernelization based approach to thek-Leaf-Out-Branching problem. We give the first polynomial kernel for Rootedk-Leaf-Out-Branching, a variant ofk-Leaf-Out-Branching where the root of the tree searched for is also a part of the input. Our kernel withO(k3) vertices is obtained using extremal combinatorics.For thek-Leaf-Out-Branching problem, we show that no polynomial-sized kernel is possible unlesscoNPis inNP/poly. However, our positive results for Rootedk-Leaf-Out-Branching immediately imply that the seemingly intractablek-Leaf-Out-Branching problem admits a data reduction tonindependent polynomial-sized kernels. These two results, tractability and intractability side by side, are the first ones separatingKarp kernelizationfromTuring kernelization. This answers affirmatively an open problem regarding “cheat kernelization” raised by Mike Fellows and Jiong Guo independently.
