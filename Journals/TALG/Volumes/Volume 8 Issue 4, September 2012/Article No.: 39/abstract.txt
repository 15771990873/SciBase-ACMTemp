In this article, the online pull-based broadcast model is considered. In this model, there arenpages of data stored at a server and requests arrive for pages online. When the serverbroadcastspagep, all outstanding requests for the same pagepare simultaneously satisfied. We consider the problem of minimizing average (total) flow time online where all pages are unit-sized. For this problem, there has been a decade-long search for an online algorithm which is scalable, that is, (1 + &epsi;)-speedO(1)-competitive for any fixed &epsi; > 0. In this article, we give thefirstanalysis of an online scalable algorithm.
