Querying uncertain data has emerged as an important problem in data management due to the imprecise nature of many measurement data. In this article, we study answering range queries over uncertain data. Specifically, we are given a collectionPofnuncertain points in ℝ, each represented by its one-dimensional probability density function (pdf). The goal is to build a data structure onPsuch that, given a query intervalIand a probability threshold τ, we can quickly report all points ofPthat lie inIwith probability at least τ. We present various structures with linear or near-linear space and (poly)logarithmic query time. Our structures support pdf's that are either histograms or more complex ones such as Gaussian or piecewise algebraic.
