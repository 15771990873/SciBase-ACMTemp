We show how to test the bipartiteness of an intersection graph ofnline segments or simple polygons in the plane, or of an intersection graph of balls ind-dimensional Euclidean space, in timeO(nlogn). More generally, we find subquadratic algorithms for connectivity and bipartiteness testing of intersection graphs of a broad class of geometric objects. Our algorithms for these problems return either a bipartition of the input or an odd cycle in its intersection graph. We also consider lower bounds for connectivity andk-colorability problems of geometric intersection graphs. For unit balls inddimensions, connectivity testing has equivalent randomized complexity to construction of Euclidean minimum spanning trees, and for line segments in the plane connectivity testing has the same lower bounds as Hopcroft's point-line incidence testing problem; therefore, for these problems, connectivity is unlikely to be solved as efficiently as bipartiteness. For line segments or planar disks, testingk-colorability of intersection graphs fork> 2 is NP-complete.
