Given a set ofnelements, each of which is colored one ofccolors, we must determine an element of the plurality (most frequently occurring) color by pairwise equal/unequal color comparisons of elements. We focus on the expected number of color comparisons when thecncolorings are equally probable. We analyze an obvious algorithm, showing that its expected performance isc2+c− 2/2cn−O(c2), with variance Θ(c2n). We present and analyze an algorithm for the casec&equals; 3 colors whose average complexity on the 3nequally probable inputs is 7083/5425n+O(&sqrt;n) &equals; 1.3056…n+O(&sqrt;n), substantially better than the expected complexity 5/3n+O(1) &equals; 1.6666…n+O(1) of the obvious algorithm. We describe a similar algorithm forc&equals;4 colors whose average complexity on the 4nequally probable inputs is 761311/402850n+O(logn) &equals; 1.8898…n+O(logn), substantially better than the expected complexity 9/4n+O(1) &equals; 2.25n+O(1) of the obvious algorithm.
