We present a 1.8-approximation algorithm for the following NP-hard problem: Given a connected graphG&equals; (V,E) and an edge setEonVdisjoint toE, find a minimum-size subset of edgesF⊆Esuch that (V,E∪F) is 2-edge-connected. Our result improves and significantly simplifies the approximation algorithm with ratio 1.875 + &epsiv; of Nagamochi.
