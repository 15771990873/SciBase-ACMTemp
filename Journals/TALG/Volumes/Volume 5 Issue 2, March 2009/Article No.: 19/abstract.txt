We consider an optimization problem consisting of an undirected graph, with cost and profit functions defined on all vertices. The goal is to find a connected subset of vertices with maximum total profit, whose total cost does not exceed a given budget. The best result known prior to this work guaranteed a (2,O(logn)) bicriteria approximation, that is, the solution's profit is at least a fraction of 1/O(logn) of an optimum solution respecting the budget, while its cost is at most twice the given budget. We improve these results and present a bicriteria tradeoff that, given any &epsiv; âˆˆ (0,1], guarantees a (1 + &epsis;,O(1/&epsiv; logn))-approximation.
