We considersuccinctor space-efficient representations of trees that efficiently support a variety of navigation operations. We focus on staticordinaltrees, that is, arbitrary static rooted trees where the children of each node are ordered. The set of operations is essentially the union of the sets of operations supported by previous succinct representations [Jacobson 1989; Munro and Raman 2001; Benoit et al. 1999] to which we add thelevel-ancestoroperation.Our representation takes 2n&plus;o(n) bits to represent ann-node tree, which is withino(n) bits of the information-theoretic minimum, and supports all operations inO(1) time on the RAM model. These operations also provide a mapping from thennodes of the tree onto the integers &lcub;1, â€¦,n&rcub;. In addition to the existing motivations for studying such data structures, we are motivated by the problem of representing XML documents compactly so that XPath queries can be supported efficiently.
