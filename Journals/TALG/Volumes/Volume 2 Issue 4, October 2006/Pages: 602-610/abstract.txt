Suppose that each member of a setAof applicants ranks a subset of a setPof posts in an order of preference, possibly involving ties. Amatchingis a set of (applicant, post) pairs such that each applicant and each post appears in at most one pair. Arank-maximalmatching is one in which the maximum possible number of applicants are matched to their first choice post, and subject to that condition, the maximum possible number are matched to their second choice post, and so on. This is a relevant concept in any practical matching situation and it was first studied by Irving [2003].We give an algorithm to compute a rank-maximal matching with running timeO(min(n&plus;C,C&sqrt;n)m), whereCis the maximal rank of an edge used in a rank-maximal matching,nis the number of applicants and posts andmis the total size of the preference lists.
