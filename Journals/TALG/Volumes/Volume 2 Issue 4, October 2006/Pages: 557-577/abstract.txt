LetG&equals; (V,E) be an undirected graph onnvertices, and let δ(u,v) denote the distance inGbetween two verticesuandv. Thorup and Zwick showed that for any positive integert, the graphGcan be preprocessed to build a data structure that can efficiently reportt-approximate distance between any pair of vertices. That is, for anyu,v∈V, the distance reported is at least δ(u,v) and at mosttδ(u,v). The remarkable feature of this data structure is that, fort≥3, it occupies subquadratic space, that is, it does not store all-pairs distances explicitly, and still it can answer anyt-approximate distance query in constant time. They named the data structure “approximate distance oracle” because of this feature. Furthermore, the trade-off between the stretchtand the size of the data structure is essentially optimal.In this article, we show that we can actually construct approximate distance oracles in expectedO(n2) time if the graph is unweighted. One of the new ideas used in the improved algorithm also leads to the first expected linear-time algorithm for computing an optimal size (2, 1)-spanner of an unweighted graph. A (2, 1) spanner of an undirected unweighted graphG&equals; (V,E) is a subgraph (V, Ê), Ê ⊆E, such that for any two verticesuandvin the graph, their distance in the subgraph is at most 2δ(u,v) &plus; 1.
