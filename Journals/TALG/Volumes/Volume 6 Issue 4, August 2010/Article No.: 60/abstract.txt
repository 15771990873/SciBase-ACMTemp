We describe a local algorithm for finding subgraphs with high density, according to a measure of density introduced by Kannan and Vinay [1999]. The algorithm takes as input a bipartite graphG, a starting vertexv, and a parameterk, and outputs an induced subgraph ofG. It is local in the sense that it does not examine the entire input graph; instead, it adaptively explores a region of the graph near the starting vertex. The running time of the algorithm is bounded byO(Δk2), which depends on the maximum degree Δ, but is otherwise independent of the graph. We prove the following approximation guarantee: for any subgraphSwithk′vertices and density θ, there exists a setS′ ⊆Sfor which the algorithm outputs a subgraph with density Ω(θ/log Δ) wheneverv&in;S′ andk≥k′. We prove thatS′ contains at least half of the edges inS.
