The problem of maximizing a concave functionf(x)in the unit simplex Δ can be solved approximately by a simple greedy algorithm. For givenk, the algorithm can find a pointx(k)on ak-dimensional face of Δ, such thatf(x(k)≥f(x&ast;) −O(1/k). Heref(x&ast;) is the maximum value offin Δ, and the constant factor depends onf. This algorithm and analysis were known before, and related to problems of statistics and machine learning, such as boosting, regression, and density mixture estimation. In other work, coming from computational geometry, the existence of &epsis;-coresets was shown for the minimum enclosing ball problem by means of a simple greedy algorithm. Similar greedy algorithms, which are special cases of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, were described for other enclosure problems. Here these results are tied together, stronger convergence results are reviewed, and several coreset bounds are generalized or strengthened.
