We study a bichromatic version of the well-knownk-set problem: given two setsRandBof points of total sizenand an integerk, how many subsets of the form(R∩h) ∪ (B&setmn;h) can have size exactlykover all halfspacesh&quest; In the dual, the problem is asymptotically equivalent to determining the worst-case combinatorial complexity of thek-levelin an arrangement ofn halfspaces.Disproving an earlier conjecture by Linhart [1993], we present the first nontrivial upper bound for allk&Lt;nin two dimensions:O(nk1/3+n5/6−&epsis;k2/3+2 &epsis;+k2) for any fixed &epsis;<0. In three dimensions, we obtain the boundO(nk3/2+n0.5034k2.4932+k3). Incidentally, this also implies a new upper bound for the originalk-set problem in four dimensions:O(n2k3/2+n1.5034k2.4932+n k3), which improves the best previous result for allk&Lt;n0.923. Extensions to other cases, such as arrangements of disks, are also discussed.
