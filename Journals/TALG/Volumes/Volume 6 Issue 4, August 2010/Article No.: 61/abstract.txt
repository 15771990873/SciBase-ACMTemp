A cycle on a combinatorial surface is tight if it as short as possible in its (free) homotopy class. We describe an algorithm to compute a single tight, noncontractible, essentially simple cycle on a given orientable combinatorial surface inO(nlogn) time. The only method previously known for this problem was to compute the globally shortest noncontractible or nonseparating cycle inO(min{g3,n},nlogn) time, wheregis the genus of the surface. As a consequence, we can compute the shortest cycle freely homotopic to a chosen boundary cycle inO(nlogn) time, a tight octagonal decomposition inO(gnlogn) time, and a shortest contractible cycle enclosing a nonempty set of faces inO(nlog2n) time.
