We introduce a new feature size for bounded domains in the plane endowed with an intrinsic metric. Given a pointxin a domainX, thesystolic feature sizeofXatxmeasures half the length of the shortest loop throughxthat is not null-homotopic inX. The resort to an intrinsic metric makes the systolic feature size rather insensitive to the local geometry of the domain, in contrast with its predecessors (local feature size, weak feature size, homology feature size). This reduces the number of samples required to capture the topology ofX, provided that a reliable approximation to the intrinsic metric ofXis available. Under sufficient sampling conditions involving the systolic feature size, we show that the geodesic Delaunay triangulationDx(L) of a finite samplingLis homotopy equivalent toX. Under similar conditions,Dx(L) is sandwiched between the geodesic witness complexCWX(L) and a relaxed versionCWX,ν(L). In the conference version of the article, we took advantage of this fact and proved that the homology ofDx(L) (and hence the one ofX) can be retrieved by computing the persistent homology betweenCWX(L) andCWX,ν(L). Here, we investigate further and show that the homology ofXcan also be recovered from the persistent homology associated with inclusions of typeCWX,ν(L)&rarrhk;CWX,ν′(L), under some conditions on the parameters ν≤ν′. Similar results are obtained for Vietoris-Rips complexes in the intrinsic metric. The proofs draw some connections with recent advances on the front of homology inference from point cloud data, but also with several well-known concepts of Riemannian (and even metric) geometry. On the algorithmic front, we propose algorithms for estimating the systolic feature size of a bounded planar domainX, selecting a landmark set of sufficient density, and computing the homology ofXusing geodesic witness complexes or Rips complexes.
