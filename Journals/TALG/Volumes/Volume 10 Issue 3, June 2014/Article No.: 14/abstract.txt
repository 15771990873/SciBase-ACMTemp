We consider the problem of findingsemi-matchingin bipartite graphs, which is also extensively studied under various names in the scheduling literature. We give faster algorithms for both weighted and unweighted cases.For the weighted case, we give anO(nmlogn)-time algorithm, wherenis the number of vertices andmis the number of edges, by exploiting the geometric structure of the problem. This improves the classicalO(n3)-time algorithms by Horn [1973] and Bruno et al. [1974b].For the unweighted case, the bound can be improved even further. We give a simple divide-and-conquer algorithm that runs inO(√nmlogn) time, improving two previousO(nm)-time algorithms by Abraham [2003] and Harvey et al. [2003, 2006]. We also extend this algorithm to solve theBalanced Edge Coverproblem inO(√nmlogn) time, improving the previousO(nm)-time algorithm by Harada et al. [2008].
