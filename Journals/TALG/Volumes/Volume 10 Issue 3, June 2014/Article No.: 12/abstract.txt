We obtain several improved solutions for thedeterministic rendezvousproblem in general undirected graphs. Our solutions answer several problems left open by Dessmark et al. We also introduce an interesting variant of the rendezvous problem, which we call thedeterministic treasure huntproblem. Both the rendezvous and the treasure hunt problems motivate the study ofuniversal traversal sequencesanduniversal exploration sequenceswith some strengthened properties. We call such sequencesstrongly universal traversal (exploration) sequences. We give an explicit construction of strongly universalexplorationsequences. The existence of strongly universaltraversalsequences, as well as the solution of the most difficult variant of the deterministic treasure hunt problem, are left as intriguing open problems.
