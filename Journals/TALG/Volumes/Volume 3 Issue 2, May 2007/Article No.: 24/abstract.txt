This is the 26th edition of a column that covers new developments in the theory of NP-completeness. The presentation is modeled on that which M. R. Garey and I used in our book “Computers and Intractability: A Guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness,” W. H. Freeman & Co., New York, 1979, hereinafter referred to as “[G&J;].” Previous columns, the first 23 of which appeared inJ. Algorithms, will be referred to by a combination of their sequence number and year of appearance, e.g., “Column 1 [1981].” Full bibliographic details on the previous columns, as well as downloadable unofficial versions of them, can be found at http://www.research.att.com/∼dsj/columns/. This column discusses the question of whether finding an object can be computationally difficult even when we know that the object exists.
