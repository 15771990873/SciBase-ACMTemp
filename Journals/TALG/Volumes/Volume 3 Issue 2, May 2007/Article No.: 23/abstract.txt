In themulticommodity rent-or-buy(MROB) network design problems, we are given a network together with a set ofkterminal pairs (s1,t1), …, (sk,tk. The goal is to provision the network so that a given amount of flow can be shipped betweensiandtifor all 1 ≤i≤ksimultaneously. In order to provision the network, one can eitherrentcapacity on edges at some cost per unit of flow, orbuythem at some larger fixed cost. Bought edges have no incremental, flow-dependent cost. The overall objective is to minimize the total provisioning cost.Recently, Gupta et al. [2003a] presented a 12-approximation for the MROB problem. Their algroithm chooses a subset of the terminal pairs in the graph at random and then buys the edges of an approximate Steiner forest for these pairs. This technique had previously been introduced [Gupta et al. 2003b] for the single-sink rent-or-buy network design problem.In this article we give a 6.828-approximation for the MROB problem by refining the algorithm of Gupta et al. and simplifying their analysis. The improvement in our article is based on a more careful adaptation and simplified analysis of the primal-dual algorithm for the Steiner forest problem due to Agrawal et al. [1995]. Our result significantly reduces the gap between the single-sink and multisink case.
