An instance of the stable marriage problem is an undirected bipartite graphG&equals; (X∪W,E) with linearly ordered adjacency lists with ties allowed in the ordering. A matchingMis a set of edges, no two of which share an endpoint. An edgee&equals; (a,b) ∈E&setmn;Mis ablocking edgeforMifais either unmatched or strictly prefersbto its partner inM, andbis unmatched, strictly prefersato its partner inM, or is indifferent between them. A matching is strongly stable if there is no blocking edge with respect to it. We give anO(nm) algorithm for computing strongly stable matchings, wherenis the number of vertices andmthe number of edges. The previous best algorithm had running timeO(m2). We also study this problem in the hospitals-residents setting, which is a many-to-one extension of the aforementioned problem. We give anO(m∑h∈Hph) algorithm for computing a strongly stable matching in the hospitals-residents problem, wherephis the quota of a hospitalh. The previous best algorithm had running timeO(m2).
