In this article, we address a new version of dynamic pattern matching. Thedynamic text and static pattern matching problemis the problem of finding a static pattern in a text that is continuously being updated. The goal is to report all new occurrences of the pattern in the text after each text update. We present an algorithm for solving the problem where the text update operation ischangingthe symbol value of a text location. Given a text of lengthnand a pattern of lengthm, our algorithm preprocesses the text in timeO(nlog logm), and the pattern in timeO(mlogm). The extra space used isO(n&plus;mlogm). Following each text update, the algorithm deletes all prior occurrences of the pattern that no longer match, and reports all new occurrences of the pattern in the text inO(log logm) time. We note that the complexity is not proportional to the number of pattern occurrences, since all new occurrences can be reported in a succinct form.
