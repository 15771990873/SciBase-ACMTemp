The edit distance between two stringsSandRis defined to be the minimum number of character inserts, deletes, and changes needed to convertRtoS. Given a text stringtof lengthn, and a pattern stringpof lengthm, informally, the string edit distance matching problem is to compute the smallest edit distance betweenpand substrings oft.We relax the problem so that: (a) we allow an additional operation, namely,substring moves; and (b) we allow approximation of this string edit distance. Our result is a near-linear time deterministic algorithm to produce a factor ofO(lognlog&ast;n) approximation to the string edit distance with moves. This is the first known significantly subquadratic algorithm for a string edit distance problem in which the distance involves nontrivial alignments. Our results are obtained by embedding strings intoL1vector space using a simplified parsing technique, which we calledit-sensitive parsing(ESP).
