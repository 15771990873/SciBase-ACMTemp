We prove superlinear lower bounds for some shortest path problems in directed graphs, where no such bounds were previously known. The central problem in our study is thereplacement pathsproblem: Given a directed graphGwith non-negative edge weights, and a shortest pathP&equals; &lcub;e1,e2, …,ep&rcub; between two nodessandt, compute the shortest path distances fromstotin each of thepgraphs obtained fromGby deleting one of the edgesei. We show that the replacement paths problem requires Ω(m&sqrt;n) time in the worst case wheneverm&equals;O(n&sqrt;n). Our construction also implies a similar lower bound on thekshortest simple paths problem for a broad class of algorithms that includes all known algorithms for the problem. To put our lower bound in perspective, we note that both these problems (replacement paths andkshortest simple paths) can be solved in near-linear time forundirectedgraphs.
