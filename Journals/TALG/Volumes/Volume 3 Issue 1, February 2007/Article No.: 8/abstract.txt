We show that for every radio networkG&equals; (V,E) and sources∈V, there exists a radio broadcast schedule forGof lengthRad(G,s) &plus;O(&sqrt;Rad(G,s) ⋅log2n) &equals;O(Rad(G,s) &plus; log4n), whereRad(G,s) is the radius of the radio networkGwith respect to the sources. This result improves the previously best-known upper bound ofO(Rad(G,s) &plus; log5n) due to Gaber and Mansour [1995].For graphs with small genus, particularly forplanargraphs, we provide an even better upper bound ofRad(G,S) &plus;O(&sqrt;Rad(G,s) ⋅ logn&plus; log3n) &equals;O(Rad(G,s) &plus; log3n).
