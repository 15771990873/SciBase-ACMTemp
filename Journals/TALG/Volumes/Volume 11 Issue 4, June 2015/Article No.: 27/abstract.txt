We consider connectivity-augmentation problems in a setting where each potential new edge has a non-negative cost associated with it, and the task is to achieve a certain connectivity target with at mostpnew edges of minimum total cost. The main result is that the minimum cost augmentation of edge-connectivity fromkâˆ’ 1 tokwith at mostpnew edges is fixed-parameter tractable parameterized bypand admits a polynomial kernel. We also prove the fixed-parameter tractability of increasing edge connectivity from 0 to 2 and increasing node connectivity from 1 to 2.
