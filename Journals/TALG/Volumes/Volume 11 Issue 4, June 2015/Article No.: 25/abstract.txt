We consider a single-machine scheduling problem. Given some continuous, nondecreasing cost function, we aim to compute a schedule minimizing the weighted total cost, where the cost of each job is determined by the cost function value at its completion time. This problem is closely related to scheduling a single machine with nonuniform processing speed. We show that for piecewise linear cost functions it is strongly NP-hard. The main contribution of this article is a tight analysis of the approximation guarantee of Smith’s rule under any convex or concave cost function. More specifically, for these wide classes of cost functions we reduce the task of determining a worst-case problem instance to a continuous optimization problem, which can be solved by standard algebraic or numerical methods. For polynomial cost functions with positive coefficients, it turns out that the tight approximation ratio can be calculated as the root of a univariate polynomial. We show that this approximation ratio is asymptotically equal tok(k− 1)&sol;(k&plus; 1), denoting bykthe degree of the cost function. To overcome unrealistic worst-case instances, we also give tight bounds for the case of integral processing times that are parameterized by the maximum and total processing time.
