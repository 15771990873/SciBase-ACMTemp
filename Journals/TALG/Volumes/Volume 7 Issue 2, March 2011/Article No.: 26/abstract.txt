We study a natural probabilistic model for motif discovery. In this model, there arekbackground sequences, and each character in a background sequence is a random character from an alphabet Σ. A motifG&equals;g1g2…gmis a string ofmcharacters. Each background sequence is implanted with a probabilistically generated approximate copy ofG. For a probabilistically generated approximate copyb1b2…bmofG, every character is probabilistically generated such that the probability forbi&neq;giis at most α.In this article, we develop an efficient algorithm that can discover a hidden motif from a set of sequences for any alphabet Σ with &vert;Σ&vert;&geq; 2 and is applicable to DNA motif discovery. We prove that for α < 1/8(1- 1/&vert;Σ&vert;), there exist positive constantsc0, &epsis;, and δ2such that if there are at leastc0logninput sequences, then inO(n2/h(logn)O(1)) time this algorithm finds the motif with probability at least 3/4 for everyG&in; Σρ-Ψρ,h,&epsis;(Σ), wherenthe length of longest sequences, ρ is the length of the motif,his a parameter with ρ&geq; 4h&geq; δ2logn, and Ψρ,h,&epsis;(Σ) is a small subset of at most 2−Θ(&epsis;2h)fraction of the sequences in Σρ.
