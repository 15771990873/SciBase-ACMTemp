The Sort Transform (ST) can significantly speed up the block sorting phase of the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) by sorting the limited order contexts. However, the best result obtained so far for the inverse ST has a time complexityO(Nlogk) and a space complexityO(N), whereNandkare the text size and the context order of the transform, respectively. In this article, we present a novel algorithm that can compute the inverse ST for anyk-order contexts in anO(N) time and space complexity, a linear result independent ofk. The main idea behind the design of this linear algorithm is a set of cycle properties ofk-order contexts that we explore for this work. These newly discovered cycle properties allow us to quickly compute the Longest Common Prefix (LCP) between any pair of adjacentk-order contexts that may belong to two different cycles, which eventually leads to the proposed linear-time solution.
