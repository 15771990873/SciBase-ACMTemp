In thegeneralized connectivityproblem, we are given an edge-weighted graphG&equals; (V,E) and a collectionD&equals; {(S1,T1), …, (Sk,Tk)} of distinctdemandseach demand (Si,Ti) is a pair of disjoint vertex subsets. We say that a subgraphFofGconnectsa demand (Si,Ti) when it contains a path with one endpoint inSiand the other inTi. The goal is to identify a minimum weight subgraph that connects all demands inD. Alon et al. (SODA '04) introduced this problem to study online network formation settings and showed that it captures some well-studied problems such as Steiner forest, facility location with nonmetric costs, tree multicast, and group Steiner tree. Obtaining a nontrivial approximation ratio for generalized connectivity was left as an open problem. We describe the first poly-logarithmic approximation algorithm for generalized connectivity that has a performance guarantee ofO(log2nlog2k). Here,nis the number of vertices inGandkis the number of demands. We also prove that the cut-covering relaxation of this problem has anO(log3nlog2k) integrality gap.Building upon the results for generalized connectivity, we obtain improved approximation algorithms for two problems that contain generalized connectivity as a special case. For thedirected Steiner networkproblem, we obtain anO(k1/2 + &epsis;) approximation which improves on the currently best performance guarantee ofÕ(k2/3) due to Charikar et al. (SODA '98). For theset connectorproblem, recently introduced by Fukunaga and Nagamochi (IPCO '07), we present a poly-logarithmic approximation; this result improves on the previously known ratio which can be Ω(n) in the worst case.
