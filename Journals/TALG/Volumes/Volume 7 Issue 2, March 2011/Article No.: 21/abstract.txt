Consider the following problem: We havekplayers each receiving a stream of items, and communicating with a central coordinator. Let the multiset of items received by playeriup until timetbeAi(t). The coordinator's task is to monitor a given functionfcomputed over the union of the inputs ∪iAi(t),continuouslyat all timest. The goal is to minimize the number of bits communicated between the players and the coordinator. Of interest is the approximate version where the coordinator outputs 1 iff&geq; τ and 0 iff&leq; (1−&epsis;)τ. This defines the (k,f,τ,&epsis;)distributed functional monitoringproblem. Functional monitoring problems are fundamental in distributed systems, in particular sensor networks, where we must minimize communication; they also connect to the well-studied streaming model and communication complexity. Yet few formal bounds are known for functional monitoring.We give upper and lower bounds for the (k,f,τ,&epsis;) problem for some of the basicf's. In particular, we study the frequency momentsFpforp&equals;0,1,2. ForF0andF1, we obtain monitoring algorithms with cost almost the same as algorithms that compute the function for a single instance of time. However, forF2the monitoring problem seems to be much harder than computing the function for a single time instance. We give a carefully constructed multiround algorithm that uses “sketch summaries” at multiple levels of details and solves the (k,F2,τ,&epsis;) problem with communicationÕ(k2/&epsis; +k3/2/&epsis;3). Our algorithmic techniques are likely to be useful for other functional monitoring problems as well.
