Approximation algorithms have so far mainly been studied for problems that are not known to have polynomial time algorithms for solving them exactly. Here we propose an approximation algorithm for the weighted matching problem in graphs which can be solved in polynomial time. The weighted matching problem is to find a matching in an edge weighted graph that has maximum weight. The first polynomial-time algorithm for this problem was given by Edmonds in 1965. The fastest known algorithm for the weighted matching problem has a running time ofO(nm+n2logn). Many real world problems require graphs of such large size that this running time is too costly. Therefore, there is considerable need for faster approximation algorithms for the weighted matching problem. We present a linear-time approximation algorithm for the weighted matching problem with a performance ratio arbitrarily close to 2/3. This improves the previously best performance ratio of 1/2. Our algorithm is not only of theoretical interest, but because it is easy to implement and the constants involved are quite small it is also useful in practice.
