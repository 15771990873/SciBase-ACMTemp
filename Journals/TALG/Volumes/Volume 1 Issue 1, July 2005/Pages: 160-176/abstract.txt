This is the 24th edition of a column that covers new developments in the theory of NP-completeness. The presentation is modeled on that which M. R. Garey and I used in our book “Computers and Intractability: A Guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness,” W. H. Freeman & Co., New York, 1979, hereinafter referred to as “[G&J;].” Previous columns, the first 23 of which appeared inJ. Algorithms, will be referred to by a combination of their sequence number and year of appearance, e.g. “[Col 1, 1981].” This edition of the column describes the history and purpose of the column and the status of the open problems from [G&J;] and previous columns.
