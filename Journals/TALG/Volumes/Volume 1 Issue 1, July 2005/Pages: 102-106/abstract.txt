We present a simple black box that takes a priority queueQwhich supports find-min, insert, and delete in x-time at mostt. Here x-time may be worst-case, expected, or amortized. The black-box transformsQinto a priority queueQ* that supports find-min in constant time, insert in constant x-time, and delete in x-timeO(t). Moreover, ifQsupports dec-key in constant time, then so doesQ*.
