A data structure is presented for point location in connected planar subdivisions when the distribution of queries is known in advance. The data structure has an expected query time that is within a constant factor of optimal. More specifically, an algorithm is presented that preprocesses a connected planar subdivisionGof sizenand a query distributionDto produce a point location data structure forG. The expected number of point-line comparisons performed by this data structure, when the queries are distributed according toD, is &Htilde; +O(&Htilde;1/2+1) where &Htilde;=&Htilde;(G,D) is a lower bound on the expected number of point-line comparisons performed by any linear decision tree for point location inGunder the query distributionD. The preprocessing algorithm runs inO(nlogn) time and produces a data structure of sizeO(n). These results are obtained by creating a Steiner triangulation ofGthat has near-minimum entropy.
