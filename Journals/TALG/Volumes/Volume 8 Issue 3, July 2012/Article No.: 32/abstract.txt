We give the first polynomial-time algorithm for checking whether the Galois group Gal(f) of an input polynomialf(X) ∈ Q[X] is nilpotent: the running time of our algorithm is bounded by a polynomial in the size of the coefficients offand the degree off. Additionally, we give a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm that, when given as input a polynomialf(X) ∈ Q[X] with nilpotent Galois group, computes for each prime factorpof &num; Gal(f), a polynomialgp(X)∈ Q[X] whose Galois group of is thep-Sylow subgroup of Gal(f).
