A left-to-right maximum in a sequence ofnnumberss1, …,snis a number that is strictly larger than all preceding numbers. In this article we present a smoothed analysis of the number of left-to-right maxima in the presence of additive random noise. We show that for every sequence ofnnumberssi∈ [0,1] that are perturbed by uniform noise from the interval [-&epsi;,&epsi;], the expected number of left-to-right maxima is Θ(&sqrt;n/&epsi; + logn) for &epsi;>1/n. For Gaussian noise with standard deviation σ we obtain a bound ofO((log3/2n)/σ + logn).We apply our results to the analysis of the smoothed height of binary search trees and the smoothed number of comparisons in the quicksort algorithm and prove bounds of Θ(&sqrt;n/&epsi; + logn) and Θ(n/&epsi;+1&sqrt;n/&epsi; +nlogn), respectively, for uniform random noise from the interval [-&epsi;,&epsi;]. Our results can also be applied to bound the smoothed number of points on a convex hull of points in the two-dimensional plane and tosmoothed motion complexity,a concept we describe in this article. We bound how often one needs to update a data structure storing the smallest axis-aligned box enclosing a set of points moving ind-dimensional space.
