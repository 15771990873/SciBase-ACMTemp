We consider the restricted assignment version of the problem of max-min fair allocation of indivisible goods, also known asthe Santa Claus problem. There aremitems andnplayers. Every item has some nonnegative value, and every player is interested in only some of the items. The goal is to distribute the items to the players in a way that maximizes the minimum of the sum of the values of the items given to any player. It was previously shown via a nonconstructive proof that uses the Lov√°sz local lemma that the integrality gap of a certain configuration LP for the problem is no worse than some (unspecified) constant. This gives a polynomial-time algorithm to estimate the optimum value of the problem within a constant factor, but does not provide a polynomial-time algorithm for finding a corresponding allocation.We use a different approach to analyze the integrality gap. Our approach is based upon local search techniques for finding perfect matchings in certain classes of hypergraphs. As a result, we prove that the integrality gap of the configuration LP is no worse than 1/4. Our proof provides a local search algorithm which finds the corresponding allocation, but is nonconstructive in the sense that this algorithm is not known to converge to a local optimum in a polynomial number of steps.
