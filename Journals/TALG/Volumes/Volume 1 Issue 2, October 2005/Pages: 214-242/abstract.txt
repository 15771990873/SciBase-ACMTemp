This paper studies the distribution of individual displacements for the standard and the Robin Hood linear probing hashing algorithms. When the a table of sizemhasnelements, the distribution of the search cost of a random element is studied for both algorithms. Specifically, exact distributions for fixedmandnare found as well as when the table is α-full, and α strictly smaller than 1. Moreover, for full tables, limit laws for both algorithms are derived.
