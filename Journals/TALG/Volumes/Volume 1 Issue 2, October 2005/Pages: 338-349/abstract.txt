This article relates the notion of fairness in online routing and load balancing tovector majorizationas developed by Hardy et al. [1929]. We define α-supermajorizationas an approximate form of vector majorization, and show that this definition generalizes and strengthens the prefix measure proposed by Kleinberg et al. [2001] as well as the popular notion ofmax-min fairness.The article revisits the problem of online load-balancing for unrelated 1-∞ machines from the viewpoint of fairness. We prove that a greedy approach isO(logn)-supermajorized by all other allocations, wherenis the number of jobs. This means the greedy approach is globallyO(logn)-fair. This may be contrasted with polynomial lower bounds presented by Goel et al. [2001] for fair online routing.We also define a machine-centric view of fairness using the related concept ofsubmajorization. We prove that the greedy online algorithm is globallyO(logm)-balanced, wheremis the number of machines.
