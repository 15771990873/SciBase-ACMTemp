The edge coloring problem considers the assignment of colors from a minimum number of colors to edges of a graph such that no two edges with the same color are incident to the same node. We give polynomial time algorithms for approximate edge coloring of multigraphs, that is, parallel edges are allowed. The best previous algorithms achieve a fixed constant approximation factor plus a small additive offset. One of our algorithms achieves solution quality opt &plus; &sqrt;9opt/2 and has execution time polynomial in the number of nodes and the logarithm of the maximum edge multiplicity.
