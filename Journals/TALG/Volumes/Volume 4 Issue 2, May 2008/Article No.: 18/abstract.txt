We analyze amoving least squares(MLS) interpolation scheme for reconstructing a surface from point cloud data. The input is a sufficiently dense set of sample points that lie near a closed surfaceFwith approximate surface normals. The output is a reconstructed surface passing near the sample points. For each sample pointsin the input, we define a linearpoint functionthat represents the local shape of the surface nears. These point functions are combined by a weighted average, yielding a three-dimensional functionI. The reconstructed surface is implicitly defined as the zero set ofI.We prove that the functionIis a good approximation to the signed distance function of the sampled surfaceFand that the reconstructed surface is geometrically close to and isotopic toF. Our sampling requirements are derived from thelocal feature sizefunction used in Delaunay-based surface reconstruction algorithms. Our analysis can handle noisy data provided the amount of noise in the input dataset is small compared to the feature size ofF.
