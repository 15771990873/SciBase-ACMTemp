In this article, we study metrics ofnegative type, which are metrics (V, d) such that &sqrt;d is an Euclidean metric; these metrics are thus also known as &ell;2-squared metrics. We show how to embedn-point negative-type metrics into Euclidean space &ell;2with distortionD&equals;O(log3/4n). This embedding result, in turn, implies anO(log3/4k)-approximation algorithm for the Sparsest Cut problem with nonuniform demands. Another corollary we obtain is thatn-point subsets of &ell;1embed into &ell;2with distortionO(log3/4n).
