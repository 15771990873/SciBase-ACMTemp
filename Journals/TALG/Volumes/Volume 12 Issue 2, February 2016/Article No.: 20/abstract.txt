In the relay placement problem, the input is a set of sensors and a numberr&ges; 1, the communication range of a relay. In theone-tierversion of the problem, the objective is to place a minimum number of relays so that between every pair of sensors there is a paththrough sensors and/or relayssuch that the consecutive vertices of the path are within distancerif both vertices are relays and within distance 1 otherwise. Thetwo-tierversion adds the restrictions that the path must gothrough relays, and not through sensors. We present a 3.11-approximation algorithm for the one-tier version and a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for the two-tier version. We also show that the one-tier version admits no PTAS, assuming P â‰  NP.
