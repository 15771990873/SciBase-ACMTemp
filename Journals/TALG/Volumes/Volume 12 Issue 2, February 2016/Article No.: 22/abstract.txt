This article proposes a forbidden-set labeling scheme for the family of unweighted graphs with doubling dimension bounded by α. For ann-vertex graphGin this family, and for any desired precision parameter &epsi; > 0, the labeling scheme stores anO(1 + &epsi;− 1)2αlog2n-bit label at each vertex. Given the labels of two end-verticessandt, and the labels of a setFof “forbidden” vertices and/or edges, our scheme can compute, inO(1 + &epsi;− 1)2α· &verbar;F&verbar;2logntime, a 1 + &epsi; stretch approximation for the distance betweensandtin the graphG&setmn;F. The labeling scheme can be extended into a forbidden-set labeled routing scheme with stretch 1 + &epsi; for graphs of bounded doubling dimension.
