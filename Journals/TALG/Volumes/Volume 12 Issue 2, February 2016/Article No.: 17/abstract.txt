We study algorithms for spectral graph sparsification. The input is a graphGwithnvertices andmedges, and the output is a sparse graph&Gtilde;that approximatesGin an algebraic sense. Concretely, for all vectorsxand any &epsi; > 0, the graph&Gtilde;satisfies (1-&epsi; )xTLGx≤xTL&Gtilde;x≤ (1+&epsi;)xTLGx, whereLGand&Gtilde;are the Laplacians ofGand&Gtilde;respectively.The first contribution of this article applies to all existing sparsification algorithms that rely on solving solving linear systems on graph Laplacians. These algorithms are the fastest known to date. Specifically, we show that less precision is required in the solution of the linear systems, leading to speedups by anO(logn) factor. We also present faster sparsification algorithms for slightly dense graphs:— AnO(mlogn) time algorithm that generates a sparsifier withO(nlog3n/&epsi;2) edges.— AnO(mlog logn) time algorithm for graphs with more thannlog5nlog lognedges.— AnO(m) algorithm for graphs with more thannlog10nedges.— AnO(m) algorithm for unweighted graphs with more thannlog8nedges.These bounds hold up to factors that are inO(poly(log logn)) and are conjectured to be removable.
