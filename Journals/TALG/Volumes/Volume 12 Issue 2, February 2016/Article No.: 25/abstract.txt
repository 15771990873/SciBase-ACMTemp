We study the well-knownLabel Coverproblem under the additional requirement that problem instances have large girth. We show that if the girth is somek, the problem is roughly 2log1-&epsi;n)/khard to approximate for all constant &epsi; > 0. A similar theorem was claimed by Elkin and Peleg [2000] as part of an attempt to prove hardness for the basick-spanner problem, but their proof was later found to have a fundamental error. Thus, we give boththe firstnontrivial lower bound for the problem of Label Cover with large girth as well as the first full proof of strong hardness for the basick-spanner problem, which is both the simplest problem in graph spanners and one of the few for which super-logarithmic hardness was not known. AssumingNP&subseteq;BPTIME(2polylog(n), we show (roughly) that for everyk&ges; 3 and every constant &epsi; > 0, it is hard to approximate the basick-spanner problem within a factor better than 2log1-&epsi;n)/k. This improves over the previous best lower bound of only Î©(logn)/kfrom Kortsarz [2001]. Our main technique is subsampling the edges of 2-query probabilistically checkable proofs (PCPs), which allows us to reduce the degree of a PCP to be essentially equal to the soundness desired. This turns out to be enough to basically guarantee large girth.
