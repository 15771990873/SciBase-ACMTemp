An instance of thesorting bufferproblem consists of a metric space and a server, equipped with a finite-capacity buffer capable of holding a limited number of requests. An additional ingredient of the input is an online sequence of requests, each of which is characterized by a destination in the given metric space; whenever a request arrives, it must be stored in the sorting buffer. At any point in time, a currently pending request can be served by drawing it out of the buffer and moving the server to its corresponding destination. The objective is to serve all input requests in a way that minimizes the total distance traveled by the server.In this article, we focus our attention on instances of the problem in which the underlying metric is either anevenly-spaced line metricor acontinuous line metric. Our main findings can be briefly summarized as follows.(1) We present adeterministicO(logn)-competitive algorithm forn-point evenly-spaced line metrics. This result improves on a randomizedO(log2n)-competitive algorithm due to Khandekar and Pandit [2006b]. It also refutes their conjecture, stating that a deterministic strategy is unlikely to obtain a nontrivial competitive ratio.(2) We devise adeterministicO(logNlog logN)-competitive algorithm for continuous line metrics, whereNdenotes the length of the input sequence. In this context, we introduce a novel discretization technique of independent interest.(3) We establish the first nontrivial lower bound for the evenly-spaced case, by proving that the competitive ratio of any deterministic algorithm is at least 2 + &sqrt;3/&sqrt;3 &ap; 2.154. This result settles, to some extent, an open question due to Khandekar and Pandit [2006b], who posed the task of attaining lower bounds on the achievable competitive ratio as a foundational objective for future research.
