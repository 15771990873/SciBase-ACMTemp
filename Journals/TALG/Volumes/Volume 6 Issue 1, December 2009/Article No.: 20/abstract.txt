Rank-convolutions have important applications in a variety of areas such as signal processing and computer vision. We define amaskas a function taking only values zero and infinity. Rank-convolutions with masks are of special interest to image processing.We show how to compute the rank-kconvolution of a function over an interval of lengthnwith an arbitrary mask of lengthminO(n&sqrt;mlogm) time. The result generalizes to thed-dimensional case. Previously no algorithm performing significantly better than the brute-forceO(nm) bound was known.Our algorithm seems to perform well in practice. We describe an implementation, illustrating its application to a problem in image processing. Already on relatively small images, our experiments show a signficant speedup compared to brute force.
