We consider the problem of simultaneous source location: selecting locations for sources in a capacitated graph such that a given set of demands can be satisfied simultaneously, with the goal of minimizing the number of locations chosen. For general directed and undirected graphs we give anO(logD)-approximation algorithm, whereDis the sum of demands, and prove matching Ω(logD) hardness results assumingP≠NP. For undirected trees, we give an exact algorithm and show how this can be combined with a result of Räcke to give a solution that exceeds edge capacities by at mostO(log2nlog logn), wherenis the number of nodes. For undirected graphs of bounded treewidth we show that the problem is stillNP-hard, but we are able to give a PTAS with at most (1 + &epsis;) violation of the capacities for arbitrarily small &epsis;, or a (k+1) approximation with exact capacities, wherekis the treewidth.
