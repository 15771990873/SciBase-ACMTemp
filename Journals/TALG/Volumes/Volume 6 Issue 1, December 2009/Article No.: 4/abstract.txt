In this work we present an in-depth study of randomized relaxedK-d trees. It covers two fundamental aspects: the randomized algorithms that allow to preserve the random properties of relaxedK-d trees and the mathematical analysis of the expected performance of these algorithms.In particular, we describe randomized update algorithms forK-d trees based on the split and join algorithms of Duch et al. [1998]. We carry out an analysis of the expected cost of all these algorithms, using analytic combinatorics techniques. We show that the average cost of split and join is of the form ζ(K) ⋅nφ(K)+o(nφ(K)), with 1 ≤ φ(K) < 1.561552813, and we give explicit formulæ for both ζ(K) and φ(K). These results on the average performance of split and join imply that the expected cost of an insertion or a deletion is Θ(nφ(K)−1) whenK> 2 and Θ(logn) forK&equals; 2.
