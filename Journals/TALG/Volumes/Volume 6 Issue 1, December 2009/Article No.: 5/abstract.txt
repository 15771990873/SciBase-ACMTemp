LetG&equals; (V,E) be an undirected graph and letS⊆V. TheS-connectivityλSG(u,v) of a node pair (u,v) inGis the maximum number ofuv-paths that no two of them have an edge or a node inS− {u,v} in common. The corresponding Connectivity Augmentation (CA) problem is: given a graphG&equals; (V,E), a node subsetS⊆V, and a nonnegative integer requirement functionr(u,v) onV×V, add a minimum size setFof new edges toGso that λSG+F(u,v) ≥r(u,v) for all (u,v) ∈V×V. Three extensively studied particular cases are: the Edge-CA (S&equals; ∅), the Node-CA (S&equals;V), and the Element-CA (r(u,v)&equals; 0 wheneveru∈Sorv∈S). A polynomial-time algorithm for Edge-CA was developed by Frank. In this article we consider the Element-CA and the Node-CA, that are NP-hard even forr(u,v) ∈ {0,2}. The best known ratios for these problems were: 2 for Element-CA andO(rmax⋅ lnn) for Node-CA, wherermax&equals; maxu,v∈Vr(u,v) andn&equals; &verbar;V&verbar;. Our main result is a 7/4-approximation algorithm for the Element-CA, improving the previously best known 2-approximation. For Element-CA withr(u,v) ∈ {0,1,2} we give a 3/2-approximation algorithm. These approximation ratios are based on a new splitting-off theorem, which implies an improved lower bound on the number of edges needed to cover a skew-supermodular set function. For Node-CA we establish the following approximation threshold: Node-CA withr(u,v) ∈ {0,k} cannot be approximated withinO(2log1−&epsis;n) for any fixed &epsis; > 0, unless NP ⊆ DTIME(npolylog(n)).
