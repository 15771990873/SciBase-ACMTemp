We consider the well-known minimum quadratic assignment problem. In this problem we are given twon×nnonnegative symmetric matricesA&equals; (aij) andB&equals; (bij). The objective is to compute a permutation π ofV&equals; {1,…,n} so that ∑i,j∈Vi≠jaπ(i),π(j)bi,jis minimized.We assume thatAis a 0/1 incidence matrix of a graph, and thatBsatisfies the triangle inequality. We analyze the approximability of this class of problems by providing polynomial bounded approximations for some special cases, and inapproximability results for other cases.
