We consider the problem of computing exact or approximate minimum cycle bases of an undirected (or directed) graphGwithmedges,nvertices and nonnegative edge weights. In this problem, a {0, 1} (−1,0,1}) incidence vector is associated with each cycle and the vector space over F2(Q) generated by these vectors is the cycle space ofG. A set of cycles is called a cycle basis ofGif it forms a basis for its cycle space. A cycle basis where the sum of the weights of the cycles is minimum is called a minimum cycle basis ofG. Cycle bases of low weight are useful in a number of contexts, for example, the analysis of electrical networks, structural engineering, chemistry, and surface reconstruction.There exists a set of Θ(mn) cycles which is guaranteed to contain a minimum cycle basis. A minimum basis can be extracted by Gaussian elimination. The resulting algorithm [Horton 1987] was the first polynomial-time algorithm. Faster and more complicated algorithms have been found since then.We present a very simple method for extracting a minimum cycle basis from the candidate set with running timeO(m2n), which improves the running time for sparse graphs. Furthermore, in the undirected case by using bit-packing we improve the running time also in the case of dense graphs. For undirected graphs we derive anO(m2n/logn+n2m) algorithm. For directed graphs we get anO(m3n) deterministic and anO(m2n) randomized algorithm.Our results improve the running times of both exact and approximate algorithms. Finally, we derive a smaller candidate set with size in Ω(m) ∩O(mn).
