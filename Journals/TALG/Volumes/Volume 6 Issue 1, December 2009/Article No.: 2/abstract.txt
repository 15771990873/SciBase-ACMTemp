Theedit distancebetween two ordered rooted trees with vertex labels is the minimum cost of transforming one tree into the other by a sequence of elementary operations consisting of deleting and relabeling existing nodes, as well as inserting new nodes. In this article, we present a worst-caseO(n3)-time algorithm for the problem when the two trees have sizen, improving the previous bestO(n3logn)-time algorithm. Our result requires a novel adaptive strategy for deciding how a dynamic program divides into subproblems, together with a deeper understanding of the previous algorithms for the problem. We prove the optimality of our algorithm among the family ofdecomposition strategyalgorithms—which also includes the previous fastest algorithms—by tightening the known lower bound of Ω(n2log2n) to Ω(n3), matching our algorithm's running time. Furthermore, we obtain matching upper and lower bounds for decomposition strategy algorithms of Θ(nm2(1 + logn/m)) when the two trees have sizesmandnandm<n.
