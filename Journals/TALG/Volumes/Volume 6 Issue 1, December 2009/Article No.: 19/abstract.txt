Daniel Simon's 1994 discovery of an efficient quantum algorithm for finding “hidden shifts” of Z2nprovided the first algebraic problem for which quantum computers are exponentially faster than their classical counterparts. In this article, we study the generalization of Simon's problem to arbitrary groups. Fixing a finite groupG, this is the problem of recovering an involutionm&equals; (m1,…,mn) ∈Gnfrom an oraclefwith the property thatf(x⋅y) &equals;f(x) ⇔y∈ {1,m}. In the current parlance, this is the hidden subgroup problem (HSP) over groups of the formGn, whereGis a nonabelian group of constant size, and where the hidden subgroup is either trivial or has order two.Although groups of the formGnhave a simple product structure, they share important representation--theoretic properties with the symmetric groupsSn, where a solution to the HSP would yield a quantum algorithm for Graph Isomorphism. In particular, solving their HSP with the so-called “standard method” requires highly entangled measurements on the tensor product of many coset states.In this article, we provide quantum algorithms with time complexity 2O(&sqrt;n)that recover hidden involutionsm&equals; (m1,…mn) ∈Gnwhere, as in Simon's problem, eachmiis either the identity or the conjugate of a known elementmwhich satisfies κ(m) &equals; −κ(1) for some κ ∈&Gcirc;. Our approach combines the general idea behind Kuperberg's sieve for dihedral groups with the “missing harmonic” approach of Moore and Russell. These are the first nontrivial HSP algorithms for group families that require highly entangled multiregister Fourier sampling.
