In the classicalbroadcast scheduling problem, there arenpages stored at a server, and requests for these pages arrive over time. Whenever a page is broadcast, it satisfies all outstanding requests for that page. The objective is to minimize averageflow timeof the requests. For any &epsi; > 0, we give a (1&plus;&epsi;)-speedO(1/&epsi;3)-competitive online algorithm for broadcast scheduling. This improves over the recent breakthrough result of Im and Moseley [2010], where they obtained a (1&plus;&epsi;)-speedO(1/&epsi;11)-competitive algorithm. Our algorithm and analysis are considerably simpler than Im and Moseley [2010]. More importantly, our techniques also extend to the general setting ofnonuniform page sizesanddependent requests. This is the first scalable algorithm for broadcast scheduling with varying size pages and resolves the main open question from Im and Moseley [2010].
