We give a randomizedO(npolylogn)-time approximation scheme for the Steiner forest problem in the Euclidean plane. For every fixed &epsi; > 0 and givennterminals in the plane with connection requests between some pairs of terminals, our scheme finds a (1 &plus; &epsi;) approximation to the minimum-length forest that connects every requested pair of terminals.
