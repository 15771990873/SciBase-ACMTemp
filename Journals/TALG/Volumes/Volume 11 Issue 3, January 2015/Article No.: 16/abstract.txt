For an undirectedn-vertex planar graphGwith nonnegative edge weights, we consider the following type of query: given two verticessandtinG, what is the weight of a minst-cut inG&quest; We show how to answer such queries in constant time withO(nlog4n) preprocessing time andO(nlogn) space. We use a Gomory-Hu tree to represent all the pairwise min cuts implicitly. Previously, no subquadratic time algorithm was known for this problem. Since all-pairs min cut and the minimum-cycle basis are dual problems in planar graphs, we also obtain an implicit representation of a minimum-cycle basis inO(nlog4n) time andO(nlogn) space. Additionally, an explicit representation can be obtained inO(C) time and space whereCis the size of the basis.These results require that shortest paths are unique. This can be guaranteed either by using randomization without overhead or deterministically with an additional log2nfactor in the preprocessing times.
