In this article, we consider a stochastic variant of the so-calledSanta Clausproblem. The Santa Claus problem is equivalent to the problem of scheduling a set ofnjobs onmparallel machines without preemption, so as tomaximizetheminimumload. We consider the identical machine version of this scheduling problem with the additional restriction that the scheduler has only aguessof the processing times; that is, the processing time of a job is arandom variable. We show that there is a critical value ρ (n,m) such that if the duration of the jobs is exponentially distributed and the expected values deviate by less than a multiplicative factor of ρ (n,m) from each other, then a greedy algorithm has an expected competitive ratio arbitrarily close to one; that is, it performs in expectation almost as good as an algorithm that knows the actual valuesin advance. On the other hand, if the expected values deviate by more than a multiplicative factor of ρ (n,m), then the expected performance is arbitrarily bad forallalgorithms.
