A feedback vertex set (fvs) of a graph is a set of vertices whose removal results in an acyclic graph. We show that if an undirected graph onnvertices with minimum degree at least 3 has a fvs on at most 1/3n1 − &epsi;vertices, then there is a cycle of length at most 6/&epsi; (for &epsi; ≥ 1/2, we can even improve this to just 6).Using this, we obtain aO((12 logk/log logk&plus; 6)knωalgorithm for testing whether an undirected graph onnvertices has a fvs of size at mostk. Herenωis the complexity of the best matrix multiplication algorithm. The previous best parameterized algorithm for this problem tookO((2k&plus; 1)kn2) time.We also investigate the fixed parameter complexity of weighted feedback vertex set problem in weighted undirected graphs.
