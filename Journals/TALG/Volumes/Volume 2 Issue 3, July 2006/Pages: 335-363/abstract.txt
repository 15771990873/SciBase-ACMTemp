We present a new approach for answering short path queries in planar graphs. For any fixed constantkand a given unweighted planar graphG&equals; (V,E), one can build in O(&verbar;V&verbar;) time a data structure, which allows to check in O(1) time whether two given vertices are at distance at mostkinGand if so a shortest path between them is returned. GraphGcan be undirected as well as directed.Our data structure works in fully dynamic environment. It can be updated in O(1) time after removing an edge or a vertex while updating after an edge insertion takes polylogarithmic amortized time. Besides deleting elements one can also disable ones for some time. It is motivated by a practical situation where nodes or links of a network may be temporarily out of service.Our results can be easily generalized to other wide classes of graphs---for instance we can take any minor-closed family of graphs.
