It is shown that the problem of maintaining the topological order of the nodes of a directed acyclic graph while insertingmedges can be solved inO(min&lcub;m3/2logn,m3/2&plus;n2logn&rcub;) time, an improvement over the best known result ofO(mn). In addition, we analyze the complexity of the same algorithm with respect to the treewidthkof the underlying undirected graph. We show that the algorithm runs in timeO(mklog2n) for generalkand that it can be implemented to run inO(nlogn) time on trees, which is optimal. The algorithm also detects cycles in the input.
