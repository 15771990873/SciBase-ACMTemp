For the register function fort-ary trees, recently introduced by Auber et al., we prove that the average is log4n&plus;O(1), if all such trees withninternal nodes are considered to be equally likely.This result remains true for rooted trees where the set of possible out-degrees is finite. Furthermore we obtain exponential tail estimates for the distribution of the register function. Thus, the distribution is highly concentrated around the mean value.
