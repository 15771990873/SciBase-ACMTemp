We present algorithms for finding optimal strategies for discounted, infinite-horizon, Determinsitc Markov Decision Processes (DMDPs). Our fastest algorithm has a worst-case running time ofO(mn), improving the recent bound ofO(mn2) obtained by Andersson and Vorbyov &lsqb;2006&rsqb;. We also present a randomizedO(m1/2n2)-time algorithm for finding Discounted All-Pairs Shortest Paths (DAPSP), improving anO(mn2)-time algorithm that can be obtained using ideas of Papadimitriou and Tsitsiklis &lsqb;1987&rsqb;.
