We establish the first nontrivial lower bounds on time-space trade-offs for the selection problem. We prove that any comparison-based randomized algorithm for finding the median requires Ω(nlog logSn) expected time in the RAM model (or more generally in the comparison branching program model), if we haveSbits of extra space besides the read-only input array. This bound is tight for allS&Gt; logn, and remains true even if the array is given in a random order. Our result thus answers a 16-year-old question of Munro and Raman &lsqb;1996&rsqb;, and also complements recent lower bounds that are restricted to sequential access, as in the multipass streaming model &lsqb;Chakrabarti et al. 2008b&rsqb;.We also prove that any comparison-based, deterministic, multipass streaming algorithm for finding the median requires Ω(nlog&ast;(n/s)+nlogsn) worst-case time (in scanning plus comparisons), if we havescells of space. This bound is also tight for alls&Gt;log2n. We get deterministic lower bounds for I/O-efficient algorithms as well.The proofs in this article are self-contained and do not rely on communication complexity techniques.
