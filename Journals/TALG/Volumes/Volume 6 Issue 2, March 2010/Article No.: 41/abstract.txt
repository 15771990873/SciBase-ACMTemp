Thek-forest problemis a common generalization of both thek-MSTand thedense-k-subgraphproblems. Formally, given a metric space onnverticesV, withmdemand pairs ⊆V×Vand a “target”k≤m, the goal is to find a minimum cost subgraph that connectsat leastkpairs. In this paper, we give anO(min{&sqrt;n⋅logk,&sqrt;k})-approximation algorithm fork-forest, improving on the previous best ratio ofO(min {n2/3,&sqrt;m}logn) by Segev and Segev.We then apply our algsorithm fork-forest to obtain approximation algorithms for severalDial-a-Rideproblems. The basic Dial-a-Ride problem is the following: given annpoint metric space withmobjects each with its own source and destination, and a vehicle capable of carryingat mostkobjects at any time, find the minimum length tour that uses this vehicle to move each object from its source to destination. We want that the tour benon-preemptive: that is, each object, once picked up at its source, is dropped only at its destination. We prove that an α-approximation algorithm for thek-forest problem implies anO(α⋅log2n)-approximation algorithm for Dial-a-Ride. Using our results fork-forest, we get anO(min{&sqrt;n,&sqrt;k}⋅log2n)-approximation algorithm for Dial-a-Ride. The only previous result known for Dial-a-Ride was anO(&sqrt;klogn)-approximation by Charikar and Raghavachari; our results give a different proof of a similar approximation guarantee—in fact, when the vehicle capacitykis large, we give a slight improvement on their results. The reduction from Dial-a-Ride to thek-forest problem is fairly robust, and allows us to obtain approximation algorithms (with the same guarantee) for some interesting generalizations of Dial-a-Ride.
