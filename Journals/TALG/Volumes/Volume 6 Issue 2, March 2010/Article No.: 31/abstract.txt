LetCbe a class of labeled connected graphs, and let Cnbe a graph drawn uniformly at random from graphs inCthat contain exactlynvertices. Denote byb(&ell;; Cn) the number of blocks (i.e., maximal biconnected subgraphs) of Cnthat contain exactly &ell; vertices, and letlb(Cn) be the number of vertices in a largest block of Cn. We show that under certain general assumptions onC, Cnbelongs with high probability to one of the following categories:(1)lb(Cn) ∼cn, for some explicitly givenc&equals;c(C), and the second largest block is of ordernα, where 1 > α &equals; α(C), or(2)lb(Cn) &equals;O(logn), that is, all blocks contain at most logarithmically many vertices.Moreover, in both cases we show that the quantityb(&ell;; Cn) is concentrated for all &ell; and we determine its expected value. As a corollary we obtain that the class of planar graphs belongs to category (1). In contrast to that, outerplanar and series-parallel graphs belong to category (2).
