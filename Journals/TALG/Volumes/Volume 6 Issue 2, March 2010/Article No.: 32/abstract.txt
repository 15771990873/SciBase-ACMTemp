We prove that given an undirected graphGonnvertices and an integerk, one can compute, in polynomial time inn, a graphG′with at most 4k2vertices and an integerk′such thatGhas a feedback vertex set of size at mostkiffG′has a feedback vertex set of size at mostk′. This result improves a previousO(k11) kernel of Burrage et al., and a more recent cubic kernel of Bodlaender. This problem was communicated by Fellows.
