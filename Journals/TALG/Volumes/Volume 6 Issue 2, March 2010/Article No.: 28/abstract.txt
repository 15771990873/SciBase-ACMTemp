We describe an automata-theoretic approach for the competitive analysis ofonline algorithms. Our approach is based onweighted automata, which assign to each input word a cost in R≥0. By relating the “unbounded look ahead” of optimal offline algorithms with nondeterminism, and relating the “no look ahead” of online algorithms with determinism, we are able to solve problems about the competitive ratio of online algorithms, and the memory they require, by reducing them to questions aboutdeterminizationandapproximated determinizationof weighted automata.
