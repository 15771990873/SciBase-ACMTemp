This article studies labeling schemes for the vertex connectivity function on general graphs. We consider the problem of assigning short labels to the nodes of anyn-node graph is such a way that given the labels of any two nodesuandv, one can decide whetheruandvarek-vertex connected inG, that is, whether there existkvertex disjoint paths connectinguandv. This article establishes an upper bound ofk2lognon the number of bits used in a label. The best previous upper bound for the label size of such a labeling scheme is 2klogn.
