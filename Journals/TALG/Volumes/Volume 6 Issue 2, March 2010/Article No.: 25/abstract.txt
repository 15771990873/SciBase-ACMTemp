A new randomized asynchronous shared-memory data structure is given for implementing an approximate counter that can be incremented once by each ofnprocesses in a model that allows up ton−1 crash failures. For any fixed &epsis;, the counter achieves a relative error of δ with high probability, at the cost ofO(((1/δ) logn)O(1/&epsis;)) register operations per increment andO(n4/5+&epsis;((1/δ) logn)O(1/&epsis;)) register operations per read. The counter combines randomized sampling for estimating large values with an expander for estimating small values. This is the first counter implementation that is sublinear the number of processes and works despite a strong adversary scheduler that can observe internal states of processes.An application of the improved counter is an improved protocol for solving randomized shared-memory consensus, which reduces the best previously known individual work complexity fromO(nlogn) to an optimalO(n), resolving one of the last remaining open problems concerning consensus in this model.
