We show conditional lower bounds for well-studied &num;P-hard problems:The number of satisfying assignments of a 2-CNF formula withnvariables cannot be computed in time exp(o(n)), and the same is true for computing the number of all independent sets in ann-vertex graph.The permanent of ann√ónmatrix with entries 0 and 1 cannot be computed in time exp(o(n)).The Tutte polynomial of ann-vertex multigraph cannot be computed in time exp(o(n)) at most evaluation points (x,y) in the case of multigraphs, and it cannot be computed in time exp(o(n/poly logn)) in the case of simple graphs.Our lower bounds are relative to (variants of) the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH), which says that the satisfiability ofn-variable 3-CNF formulas cannot be decided in time exp(o(n)). We relax this hypothesis by introducing its counting version &num;ETH; namely, that the satisfying assignments cannot be counted in time exp(o(n)). In order to use &num;ETH for our lower bounds, we transfer the sparsification lemma ford-CNF formulas to the counting setting.
