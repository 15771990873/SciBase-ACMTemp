The Odd Cycle Transversal problem (OCT) asks whether a given undirected graph can be made bipartite by deleting at mostkof its vertices. In a breakthrough result, Reed, Smith, and Vetta (Operations Research Letters, 2004) gave aO(4kkmn) time algorithm for it; this also implies that instances of the problem can be reduced to a so-called problem kernel of sizeO(4k). Since then, the existence of a polynomial kernel for OCT (i.e., a kernelization with size bounded polynomially ink) has turned into one of the main open questions in the study of kernelization, open even for the special case of planar input graphs.This work provides the first (randomized) polynomial kernelization for OCT. We introduce a novel kernelization approach based on matroid theory, where we encode all relevant information about a problem instance into a matroid with a representation of size polynomial ink. This represents the first application of matroid theory to kernelization.
