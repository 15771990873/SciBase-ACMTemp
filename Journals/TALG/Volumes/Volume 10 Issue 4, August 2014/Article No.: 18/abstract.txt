We show that for every positive &epsiv; > 0, unless NP ⊂ BPQP, it is impossible to approximate the maximum quadratic assignment problem within a factor better than 2log1-&epsiv;nby a reduction from the maximum label cover problem. Our result also implies that Approximate Graph Isomorphism is not robust and is, in fact, 1 - &epsiv; versus &epsiv; hard assuming the Unique Games Conjecture.Then, we present anO(√n)-approximation algorithm for the problem based on rounding of the linear programming relaxation often used in state-of-the-art exact algorithms.
