In STOC’95, Arya et al. [1995] showed that for any set ofnpoints in Rd, a (1 +ε)-spanner with diameter at most 2 (respectively, 3) andO(nlogn) edges (respectively,O(nlog logn) edges) can be built inO(nlogn) time. Moreover, it was shown in Arya et al. [1995] and Narasimhan and Smid [2007] that for anyk≥ 4, one can build inO(n(logn)2kαk(n)) time a (1 +ε)-spanner with diameter at most 2kandO(n2kαk(n)) edges. The functionαkis the inverse of a certain function at thek/2 th level of the primitive recursive hierarchy, whereα0(n) =n/2 ,α1(n) = √n,α2(n) = logn,α3(n) = log logn,α4(n) = log*n,α5(n) = 12 log*n, ..., etc. It is also known [Narasimhan and Smid 2007] that if one allows quadratic time, then these bounds can be improved. Specifically, for anyk≥ 4, a (1 +ε)-spanner with diameter at mostkandO(nkαk(n)) edges can be constructed inO(n2) time [Narasimhan and Smid 2007].A major open question in this area is whether one can construct within timeO(nlogn+nkαk(n)) a (1 +ε)-spanner with diameter at mostkandO(nkαk(n)) edges. In this article, we answer this question in the affirmative. Moreover, in fact, we provide a stronger result. Specifically, we show that for anyk≥ 4, a (1 +ε)-spanner with diameter at mostkandO(nαk(n)) edges can be built in optimal timeO(nlogn).
