We consider the following variant of the classical pattern matching problem: given an uncompressed patternp[1..m] and a compressed representation of a stringt[1..N], doespoccur int? Whentis compressed using the LZW method, we are able to detect the occurrence in optimal linear time, thus answering a question of Amir et al. [1994]. Previous results implied solutions with complexitiesO(nlogm+m) Amir et al. [1994],O(n+m1+Îµ) [Kosaraju 1995], or (randomized)O(nlogNn+m) [Farach and Thorup 1995], wherenis the size of the compressed representation oft. Our algorithm is conceptually simple and fully deterministic.
