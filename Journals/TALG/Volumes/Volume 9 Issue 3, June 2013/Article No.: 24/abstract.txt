A well-studied special case ofbin packingis the3-partition problem, wherenitems of size > 1/4 have to be packed in a minimum number of bins of capacity one. The famousKarmarkar-Karp algorithmtransforms a fractional solution of a suitable LP relaxation for this problem into an integral solution that requires at mostO(logn) additional bins.Thethree-permutations-problemof Beck is the following. Given any three permutations onnsymbols, color the symbols red and blue, such that in any interval of any of those permutations, the number of red and blue symbols is roughly the same. The necessary difference is called thediscrepancy.We establish a surprising connection between bin packing and Beck’s problem: The additive integrality gap of the 3-partition linear programming relaxation can be bounded by the discrepancy of three permutations.This connection yields an alternative method to establish anO(logn) bound on the additive integrality gap of the 3-partition. Conversely, making use of a recent example of three permutations, for which a discrepancy of Ω(logn) is necessary, we prove the following: TheO(log2n) upper bound on the additive gap for bin packing with arbitrary item sizes cannot be improved by any technique that is based on rounding up items. This lower bound holds for a large class of algorithms including the Karmarkar-Karp procedure.
