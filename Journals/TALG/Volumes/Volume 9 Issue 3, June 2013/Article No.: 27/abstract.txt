This article presents a new deterministic algorithm for decremental maintenance of the transitive closure in a directed graph. The algorithm processes any sequence of edge deletions inO(mn) time and answers queries in constant time. Previously, such time bound has only been achieved by a randomized Las Vegas algorithm. In addition to that, a few decremental algorithms for maintaining strongly connected components are shown, whose time complexity isO(n1.5) for planar graphs,O(nlogn) for graphs with bounded treewidth andO(mn) for general digraphs.
