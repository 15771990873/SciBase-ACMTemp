A graphGis thek-leaf powerof a treeTif its vertices are leaves ofTsuch that two vertices are adjacent inGif and only if their distance inTis at mostk. ThenTis ak-leaf rootofG. This notion was introduced and studied by Nishimura, Ragde, and Thilikos [2002], motivated by the search for underlying phylogenetic trees. Their results imply anO(n3)-time recognition algorithm for 4-leaf powers. Recently, Rautenbach [2006] as well as Dom et al. [2005] characterized 4-leaf powers without true twins in terms of forbidden subgraphs. We give new characterizations for 4-leaf powers and squares of trees by a complete structural analysis. As a consequence, we obtain a conceptually simple linear-time recognition of 4-leaf powers.
