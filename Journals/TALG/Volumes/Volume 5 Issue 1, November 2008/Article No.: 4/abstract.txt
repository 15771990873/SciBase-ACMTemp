We present simple, fully dynamic and kinetic data structures, which are variants of a dynamic two-dimensional range tree, for maintaining the closest pair and all nearest neighbors for a set ofnmoving points in the plane; insertions and deletions of points are also allowed. If no insertions or deletions take place, the structure for the closest pair usesO(nlogn) space, and processesO(n2βs+2(n)logn) critical events, each inO(log2n) time. Heresis the maximum number of times where the distances between any two specific pairs of points can become equal, βs(q) &equals; λs(q)/q, and λs(q) is the maximum length of Davenport-Schinzel sequences of ordersonqsymbols. The dynamic version of the problem incurs a slight degradation in performance: Ifm≥ninsertions and deletions are performed, the structure still usesO(nlogn) space, and processesO(mnβs+2(n)log3n) events, each inO(log3n) time.Our kinetic data structure for all nearest neighbors usesO(nlog2n) space, and processesO(n2β2s+2(n)log3n) critical events. The expected time to process all events isO(n2βs+22(n) log4n), though processing a single event may take Θ(n) expected time in the worst case. Ifm≥ninsertions and deletions are performed, then the expected number of events isO(mnβ2s+2(n) log3n) and processing them all takesO(mnβ2s+2(n) log4n). An insertion or deletion takesO(n) expected time.
