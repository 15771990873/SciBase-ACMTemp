In this article, we consider the problem of computing a minimum-weight vertex-cover in ann-node, weighted, undirected graphG&equals; (V,E). We present a fully distributed algorithm for computing vertex covers of weight at most twice the optimum, in the case of integer weights. Our algorithm runs in an expected number ofO(logn+ log&Wcirc;) communication rounds, where&Wcirc;is the average vertex-weight. The previous best algorithm for this problem requiresO(logn(logn+ log&Wcirc;)) rounds and it is not fully distributed.For a maximal matchingMinG, it is a well-known fact that any vertex-cover inGneeds to have at least &verbar;M&verbar; vertices. Our algorithm is based on a generalization of this combinatorial lower-bound to the weighted setting.
