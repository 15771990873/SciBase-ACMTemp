We introduce a new combinatorial optimization problem in this article, called theminimum common integer partition(MCIP) problem, which was inspired by computational biology applications including ortholog assignment and DNA fingerprint assembly. Apartitionof a positive integernis a multiset of positive integers that add up to exactlyn, and aninteger partitionof a multisetSof integers is defined as the multiset union of partitions of integers inS. Given a sequence of multisetsS1,S2, …,Skof integers, wherek≥ 2, we say that a multiset is acommon integer partitionif it is an integer partition of every multisetSi, 1 ≤i≤k. The MCIP problem is thus defined as to find a common integer partition ofS1,S2, …,Skwith the minimum cardinality, denoted as MCIP(S1,S2, …,Sk). It is easy to see that the MCIP problem is NP-hard, since it generalizes the well-known subset sum problem. We can in fact show that it is APX-hard. We will also present a 5/4-approximation algorithm for the MCIP problem whenk&equals; 2, and a 3k(k−1)/3k−2-approximation algorithm fork≥ 3.
