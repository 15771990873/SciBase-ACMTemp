We provide an algorithm listing all minimal dominating sets of a graph onnvertices in timeO(1.7159n). This result can be seen as an algorithmic proof of the fact that the number of minimal dominating sets in a graph onnvertices is at most 1.7159n, thus improving on the trivialO(2n/&sqrt;n) bound. Our result makes use of the measure-and-conquer technique which was recently developed in the area of exact algorithms.Based on this result, we derive anO(2.8718n) algorithm for the domatic number problem.
