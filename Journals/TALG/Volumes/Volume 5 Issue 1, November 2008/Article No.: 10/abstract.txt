Rank-width was defined by Oum and Seymour [2006] to investigate clique-width. They constructed an algorithm that either outputs a rank-decomposition of width at mostf(k) for some functionfor confirms that rank-width is larger thankin timeO(&verbar;V&verbar;9log &verbar;V&verbar;) for an input graphG&equals; (V,E) and a fixedk. We develop three separate algorithms of this kind with faster running time. We construct anO(&verbar;V&verbar;4)-time algorithm withf(k) &equals; 3k+ 1 by constructing a subroutine for the previous algorithm; we avoid generic algorithms minimizing submodular functions used by Oum and Seymour. Another one is anO(&verbar;V&verbar;3)-time algorithm withf(k) &equals; 24k, achieved by giving a reduction from graphs to binary matroids; then we use an approximation algorithm for matroid branch-width by Hlin&ecaron;ný [2005]. Finally we construct anO(&verbar;V&verbar;3)-time algorithm withf(k) &equals; 3k− 1 by combining the ideas of the two previously cited papers.
