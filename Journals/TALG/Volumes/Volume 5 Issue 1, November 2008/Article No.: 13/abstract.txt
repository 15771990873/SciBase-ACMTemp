The Tower of Hanoi problem is generalized by placing pegs on the vertices of a given directed graphGwith two distinguished vertices,SandD, and allowing moves only along arcs of this graph. An optimal solution for such a graphGis an algorithm that completes the task of moving a tower of any given number of disks fromStoDin a minimal number of disk moves.In this article we present an algorithm which solves the problem for two infinite families of graphs, and prove its optimality. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first optimality proof for aninfinitefamily of graphs.Furthermore, we present a unified algorithm that solves the problem for a wider family of graphs and conjecture its optimality.
