Given a setSofnpoints in R3, a pointxin R3is calledcenter point of Sif every closed halfspace whose bounding hyperplane passes throughxcontains at least ⌈n/4⌉ points fromS. We present a near-quadratic algorithm for computing thecenter region, that is the set of all center points, of a set ofnpoints in R3. This is nearly tight in the worst case since the center region can have Ω(n2) complexity.We then consider setsSof 3npoints in the plane which are the union of three disjoint sets consisting respectively ofnred,nblue, andngreen points. A pointxin R2is called acolored Tverberg point of Sif there is a partition ofSintontriples with one point of each color, so thatxlies in all triangles spanned by these triples. We present a first polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing whether a given point is a colored Tverberg point of such a 3-colored setS.
