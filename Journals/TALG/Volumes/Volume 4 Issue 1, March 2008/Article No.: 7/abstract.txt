Consider a digraph withnvertices. For any fixed valuek, we present linear- and almost-linear-time algorithms to find a cycle of length ≥k, if one exists. We also find a cycle that has length ≥ logn/log lognin polynomial time, if one exists. Under an appropriate complexity assumption it is known to be impossible to improve this guarantee by more than a log lognfactor. Our approach is based on depth-first search.
