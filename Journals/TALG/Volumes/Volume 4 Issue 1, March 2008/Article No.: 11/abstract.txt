We consider a general class of scheduling problems where a set ofconflictingjobs needs to be scheduled (preemptively or nonpreemptively) on a set of machines so as to minimize the weighted sum of completion times. The conflicts among jobs are formed as anarbitraryconflict graph.Building on the framework of Queyranne and Sviridenko [2002b], we present a general technique for reducing the weighted sum of completion-times problem to the classical makespan minimization problem. Using this technique, we improve the best-known results for scheduling conflicting jobs with the min-sum objective, on several fundamental classes of graphs, including line graphs, (k&plus; 1)-claw-free graphs, and perfect graphs. In particular, we obtain the first constant-factor approximation ratio for nonpreemptive scheduling on interval graphs. We also improve the results of Kim [2003] for scheduling jobs on line graphs and for resource-constrained scheduling.
