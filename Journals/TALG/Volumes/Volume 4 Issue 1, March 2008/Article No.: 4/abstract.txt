Theintersection of sorted arraysproblem has applications in search engines such as Google. Previous work has proposed and compared deterministic algorithms for this problem, in an adaptive analysis based on the encoding size of a certificate of the result (cost analysis). We define thealternation analysis, based on the nondeterministic complexity of an instance. In this analysis we prove that there is a deterministic algorithm asymptotically performing as well as any randomized algorithm in the comparison model. We define theredundancy analysis, based on a measure of the internal redundancy of the instance. In this analysis we prove that any algorithm optimal in the redundancy analysis is optimal in the alternation analysis, but that there is a randomized algorithm which performs strictly better than any deterministic algorithm in the comparison model. Finally, we describe how these results can be extended beyond the comparison model.
