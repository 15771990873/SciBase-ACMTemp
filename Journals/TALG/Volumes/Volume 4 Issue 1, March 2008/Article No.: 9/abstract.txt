We present the priority R-tree, or PR-tree, which is the first R-tree variant that always answers a window query usingO((N/B)1âˆ’1/d&plus;T/B) I/Os, whereNis the number ofd-dimensional (hyper-) rectangles stored in the R-tree,Bis the disk block size, andTis the output size. This is provably asymptotically optimal and significantly better than other R-tree variants, where a query may visit allN/Bleaves in the tree even whenT&equals; 0. We also present an extensive experimental study of the practical performance of the PR-tree using both real-life and synthetic data. This study shows that the PR-tree performs similarly to the best-known R-tree variants on real-life and relatively nicely distributed data, but outperforms them significantly on more extreme data.
