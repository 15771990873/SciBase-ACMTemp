We obtain a new fully dynamic algorithm for maintaining the transitive closure of a directed graph. Our algorithm maintains the transitive closure matrix in a total running time ofO(mn&plus; (ins&plus;del) ·n2), whereins(del) is the number of insert (delete) operations performed. Herenis the number of vertices in the graph andmis theinitialnumber of edges in the graph. Obviously, reachability queries can be answered in constant time. The algorithm uses onlyO(n2) time which is essentially optimal for maintaining the transitive closure matrix. Our algorithm can also support path queries. Ifvis reachable fromu, the algorithm can produce a path fromutovin time proportional to the length of the path. The best previously known algorithm for the problem is due to Demetrescu and Italiano [2000]. Their algorithm has a total running time ofO(n3&plus; (ins&plus;del) ·n2). The query time is also constant. In addition, we also present a simple algorithm for directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with a total running time ofO(mn&plus;ins·n2&plus;del). Our algorithms are obtained by combining some new ideas with techniques of Italiano [1986, 1988], King [1999], King and Thorup [2001] and Frigioni et al. [2001]. We also note that our algorithms are extremely simple and can be easily implemented.
