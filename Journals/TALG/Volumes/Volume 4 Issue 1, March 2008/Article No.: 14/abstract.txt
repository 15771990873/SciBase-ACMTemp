For a massive I/O array of sizen, we want to compute the firstNlocal moments, for some constantN. Our simpler algorithms partition the array into consecutive ranges called bins, and apply not only to local-moment queries, but also to algebraic queries. WithNbuffers of size &sqrt;n, time complexity drops toO(&sqrt;n). A more sophisticated approach uses hierarchical buffering and has a logarithmic time complexity (O(blogbn)), when usingNhierarchical buffers of sizen/b. Using overlapped bin buffering, we show that only one buffer is needed, as with wavelet-based algorithms, but using much less storage.
