Contact graphs of isothetic rectangles unify many concepts from applications including VLSI and architectural design, computational geometry, and GIS. Minimizing the area of their correspondingrectangular layoutsis a key problem. We study the area-optimization problem and show that it is NP-hard to find a minimum-area rectangular layout of a given contact graph. We presentO(n)-time algorithms that constructO(n2)-area rectangular layouts for general contact graphs andO(nlogn)-area rectangular layouts for trees. (For trees, this is anO(logn)-approximation algorithm.) We also present an infinite family of graphs (respectively, trees) that require Ω(n2) (respectively, Ω(nlogn))area.We derive these results by presenting a new characterization of graphs that admit rectangular layouts, using the related concept ofrectangular duals. A corollary to our results relates the class of graphs that admit rectangular layouts torectangle-of-influence drawings.
