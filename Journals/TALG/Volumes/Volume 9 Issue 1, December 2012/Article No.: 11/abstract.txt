We show that for every fixedj≥i≥ 1, thek-DominatingSetproblem restricted to graphs that do not haveKij(the complete bipartite graph on (i+j) vertices, where the two parts haveiandjvertices, respectively) as a subgraph is fixed parameter tractable (FPT) and has a polynomial kernel. We describe a polynomial-time algorithm that, given aKi,j-free graphGand a nonnegative integerk, constructs a graphH(the “kernel”) and an integerk' such that (1)Ghas a dominating set of size at mostkif and only ifHhas a dominating set of size at mostk', (2)HhasO((j+ 1)i+ 1ki2) vertices, and (3)k' =O((j+ 1)i+ 1ki2).Sinced-degenerate graphs do not haveKd+1,d+1as a subgraph, this immediately yields a polynomial kernel onO((d+ 2)d+2k(d+ 1)2) vertices for thek-DominatingSetproblem ond-degenerate graphs, solving an open problem posed by Alon and Gutner [Alon and Gutner 2008; Gutner 2009].The most general class of graphs for which a polynomial kernel was previously known fork-DominatingSetis the class ofKh-topological-minor-free graphs [Gutner 2009]. Graphs of bounded degeneracy are the most general class of graphs for which an FPT algorithm was previously known for this problem.Kh-topological-minor-free graphs areKi,j-free for suitable values ofi,j(but not vice-versa), and so our results show thatk-DominatingSethas both FPT algorithms and polynomial kernels in strictly more general classes of graphs.Using the same techniques, we also obtain anO(jki) vertex-kernel for thek-IndependentDominatingSetproblem onKi,j-free graphs.
