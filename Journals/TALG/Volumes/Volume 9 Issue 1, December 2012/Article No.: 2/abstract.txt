In the Steiner Network problem, we are given a graphGwith edge-costs and connectivity requirementsruvbetween node pairsu,v. The goal is to find a minimum-cost subgraphHofGthat containsruvedge-disjoint paths for allu,v∈V. In Prize-Collecting Steiner Network problems, we do not need to satisfy all requirements, but are given apenalty functionfor violating the connectivity requirements, and the goal is to find a subgraphHthat minimizes the cost plus the penalty. The case whenruv∈ {0,1} is the classic Prize-Collecting Steiner Forest problem.In this article, we present a novel linear programming relaxation for the Prize-Collecting Steiner Network problem, and by rounding it, obtain the first constant-factor approximation algorithm for submodular and monotone nondecreasing penalty functions. In particular, our setting includes all-or-nothing penalty functions, which charge the penalty even if the connectivity requirement is slightly violated; this resolves an open question posed by Nagarajan et al. [2008]. We further generalize our results for element-connectivity and node-connectivity.
