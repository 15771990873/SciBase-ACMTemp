We give approximation algorithms for the Survivable Network problem. The input consists of a graphG= (V,E) with edge/node-costs, a node subsetS⊆V, and connectivity requirements {r(s,t):s,t∈T⊆V}. The goal is to find a minimum cost subgraphHofGthat for alls,t∈Tcontainsr(s,t) pairwise edge-disjointst-paths such that no two of them have a node inS&setmn; {s,t} in common. Three extensively studied particular cases are: Edge-Connectivity Survivable Network (S= ∅), Node-Connectivity Survivable Network (S=V), and Element-Connectivity Survivable Network (r(s,t) = 0 whenevers∈Sort∈S). Letk= maxs,t ∈ Tr(s,t). In Rooted Survivable Network, there iss∈Tsuch thatr(u,t) = 0 for allu≠s, and in the Subsetk-Connected Subgraph problemr(s,t) =kfor alls,t∈T.For edge-costs, our ratios areO(klogk) for Rooted Survivable Network andO(k2logk) for Subsetk-Connected Subgraph. This improves the previous ratioO(k2logn), and for constant values ofksettles the approximability of these problems to a constant.For node-costs, our ratios are as follows.—O(klog |T|) for Element-Connectivity Survivable Network, matching the best known ratio for Edge-Connectivity Survivable Network.—O(k2log |T|) for Rooted Survivable Network andO(k3log |T|) for Subsetk-Connected Subgraph, improving the ratioO(k8log2|T|).—O(k4log2|T|) for Survivable Network; this is the first nontrivial approximation algorithm for the node-costs version of the problem.
