LetPbe a simple polygon and let &lcub;(u1,u′1), (u2,u′2),…,(um,u′m)&rcub; be a set ofmpairs of distinct vertices ofP, where for every distincti,j≤m, there exist pairwise disjoint (nonintersecting) paths connectinguitou′iandujtou′j. We wish to constructmpairwise disjoint paths in the interior ofPconnectinguitou′ifori&equals; 1, …,m, with a minimal total number of line segments. We give an approximation algorithm that constructs such a set of paths usingO(M) line segments inO(nlogm&plus;Mlogm) time, whereMis the number of line segments in the optimal solution andnis the size of the polygon.
