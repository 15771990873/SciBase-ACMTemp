Two equal length stringssands′, over alphabets Σsand Σs′,parameterize matchif there exists a bijection π : Σs&rightarrow; Σs′ such that π (s) &equals;s′, where π (s) is the renaming of each character ofsvia π.Parameterized matchingis the problem of finding all parameterized matches of a pattern stringpin a textt, andapproximate parameterized matchingis the problem of finding at each location a bijection π that maximizes the number of characters that are mapped frompto the appropriate &verbar;p&verbar;-length substring oft.Parameterized matching was introduced as a model for software duplication detection in software maintenance systems and also has applications in image processing and computational biology. For example, approximate parameterized matching models image searching with variable color maps in the presence of errors.We consider the problem for which an error threshold,k, is given, and the goal is to find all locations intfor which there exists a bijection π which mapspinto the appropriate &verbar;p&verbar;-length substring oftwith at mostkmismatched mapped elements. Our main result is an algorithm for this problem withO(nk1.5&plus;mklogm) time complexity, wherem&equals; &verbar;p&verbar; andn&equals;&verbar;t&verbar;. We also show that when &verbar;p&verbar; &equals; &verbar;t&verbar; &equals;m, the problem is equivalent to the maximum matching problem on graphs, yielding aO(m&plus;k1.5) solution.
