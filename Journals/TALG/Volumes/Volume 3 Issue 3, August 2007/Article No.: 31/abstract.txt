In this article we introduce the notion of nearest-neighbor-preserving embeddings. These are randomized embeddings between two metric spaces which preserve the (approximate) nearest-neighbors. We give two examples of such embeddings for Euclidean metrics with low “intrinsic” dimension. Combining the embeddings with known data structures yields the best-known approximate nearest-neighbor data structures for such metrics.
