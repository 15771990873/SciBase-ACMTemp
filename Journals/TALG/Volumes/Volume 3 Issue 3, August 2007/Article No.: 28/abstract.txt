Given is a sequence ofnpositive integersw1,w2,…,wnthat are associated with the items 1,2,…n, respectively. In thewindows schedulingproblem, the goal is to schedule all the items (equal-length information pages) on broadcasting channels such that the gap between two consecutive appearances of pageion any of the channels is at mostwislots (a slot is the transmission time of one page). In theunit-fractions bin packingproblem, the goal is to pack all the items in bins of unit size where the size (width) of itemiis 1/wi. The optimization objective is to minimize the number of channels or bins. In the offline setting, the sequence is known in advance, whereas in the online setting, the items arrive in order and assignment decisions are irrevocable. Since a page requires at least 1/wiof a channel's bandwidth, it follows that windows scheduling without migration (i.e., all broadcasts of a page must be from the same channel) is a restricted version of unit-fractions bin packing.LetH&equals; ⌈∑i&equals;1n(1/wi) be the bandwidth lower bound on the required number of bins (channels). The best-known offline algorithm for the windows scheduling problem usedH&plus;O(lnH) channels. This article presents an offline algorithm for the unit-fractions bin packing problem with at mostH&plus; 1 bins. In the online setting, this article presents algorithms for both problems withH&plus;O(&sqrt;H) channels or bins, where the one for the unit-fractions bin packing problem is simpler. On the other hand, this article shows that already for the unit-fractions bin packing problem, any online algorithm must use at leastH&plus;Ω(lnH) bins. For instances in which the window sizes form a divisible sequence, an optimal online algorithm is presented. Finally, this article includes a new NP-hardness proof for the windows scheduling problem.
