In this article, we present a new data structure, called the permutation tree, to improve the running time of sorting permutation by transpositions and sorting permutation by block interchanges. The existing 1.5-approximation algorithm for sorting permutation by transpositions has time complexityO(n3/2&sqrt;logn). By means of the permutation tree, we can improve this algorithm to achieve time complexityO(nlogn). We can also improve the algorithm for sorting permutation by block interchanges to take its time complexity fromO(n2) down toO(nlogn).
