We consider the unsplittable flow problem on a line. In this problem, we are given a set ofntasks, each specified by a start timesi, an end timeti, a demanddi> 0, and a profitpi> 0. A task, if accepted, requiresdiunits of “bandwidth” from timesitotiand accrues a profit ofpi. For every timet, we are also specified the available bandwidthct, and the goal is to find a subset of tasks with maximum profit subject to the bandwidth constraints.We present the first polynomial timeO(logn) approximation algorithm for this problem. This significantly advances the state of the art, as no polynomial timeo(n) approximation was known previously. Previous results for this problem were known only in more restrictive settings; in particular, either the instance satisfies the so-called “no-bottleneck” assumption: maxidi≤ mintct, or the ratio of both maximum to minimum demands and maximum to minimum capacities are polynomially (or quasi-polynomially) bounded inn. Our result, on the other hand, does not require these assumptions.Our algorithm is based on a combination of dynamic programming and rounding a natural linear programming relaxation for the problem. While there is an Ω(n) integrality gap known for this LP relaxation, our key idea is to exploit certain structural properties of the problem to show that instances that are bad for the LP can in fact be handled using dynamic programming.
