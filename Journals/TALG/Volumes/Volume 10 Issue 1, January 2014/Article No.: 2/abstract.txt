We study the problem of assigning jobs to applicants. Each applicant has a weight and provides apreference list, which may contain ties, ranking a subset of the jobs. An applicantxmay prefer one matching to another (or be indifferent between them, in case of a tie) based on the jobsxgets in the two matchings andx’s personal preference. A matchingMispopularif there is no other matchingM′ such that the weight of the applicants who preferM′ toMexceeds the weight of those who preferMtoM′.We present algorithms to find a popular matching, or if none exists, to establish so. For instances with strict preference lists, we give anO(n&plus;mtime algorithm. For preference lists with ties, we give a more involved algorithm that solves the problem inO(min (k√n;,n)m) time, wherekis the number of distinct weights the applicants are given.
