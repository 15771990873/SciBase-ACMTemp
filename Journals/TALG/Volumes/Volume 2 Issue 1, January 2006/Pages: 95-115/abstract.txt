Considernindependent jobs andmuniform machines in parallel. Each job has a processing requirement and a deadline. All jobs are available for processing at timet&equals; 0. Jobjmust complete its processing before or at its deadline and preemptions are allowed. A set of jobs is said to befeasibleif there exists a schedule that meets all the deadlines. We present a polynomial-time algorithm that given a feasible set of jobs, constructs a schedule that minimizes the total completion time ∑Cj. In the classical α &verbar; β &verbar; γ scheduling notation, this problem is referred to asQm&verbar;prmt,&dmacr;j&verbar; ∑Cj. It is well known that a generalization of this problem with regard to its machine environment results in an NP-hard problem.
