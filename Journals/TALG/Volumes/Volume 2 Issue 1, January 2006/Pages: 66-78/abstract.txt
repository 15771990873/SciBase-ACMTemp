LetG&equals; (V,E) be an undirected graph, with three numbersd0(e) ≥d1(e) ≥d2(e) ≥ 0 for each edgee∈E. A solution is a subsetU⊆Vanddi(e) represents the cost contributed to the solution by the edgeeif exactlyiof its endpoints are in the solution. The cost of including a vertexvin the solution isc(v). A solution has cost that is equal to the sum of the vertex costs and the edge costs. The minimum generalized vertex cover problem is to compute a minimum cost set of vertices. We study the complexity of the problem with the costsd0(e) &equals; 1,d1(e) &equals; α andd2(e) &equals; 0 ∀e∈Eandc(v) &equals; β∀v∈V, for all possible values of α and β. We also provide 2-approximation algorithms for the general case.
