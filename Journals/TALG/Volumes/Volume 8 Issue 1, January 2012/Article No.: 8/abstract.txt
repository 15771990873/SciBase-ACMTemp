We deal with exact algorithms forBandwidth, a long studied NP-hard problem. For a long time nothing better than the trivialO*(n!)1exhaustive search was known. In 2000, Feige and Kilian [Feige 2000] came up with aO*(10n)-time and polynomial space algorithm.In this article we present a new algorithm that solvesBandwidthinO*(5n) time andO*(2n) space. Then, we take a closer look and introduce a major modification that makes it run inO(4.83n) time with a cost of aO*(4n) space complexity. This modification allowed us to perform the Measure & Conquer analysis for the time complexity which was not used for graph layout problems before.
