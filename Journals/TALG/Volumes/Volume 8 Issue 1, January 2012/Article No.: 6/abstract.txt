The research in the parameterized3d-matchingproblem has yielded a number of new algorithmic techniques and an impressive list of improved algorithms. In this article, a new deterministic algorithm for the problem is developed that integrates and improves a number of known techniques, including greedy localization, dynamic programming, and color coding. The new algorithm, which either constructs a matching ofktriples in a given triple set or correctly reports that no such a matching exists, runs in timeO*(2.803k), improving a long list of previous algorithms for the problem.
