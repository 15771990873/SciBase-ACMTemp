In computational phylogenetics, the problem of constructing a consensus tree for a given set of rooted input trees has frequently been addressed. In this article we study theMinimum-Flip Problem: the input trees are transformed into a binary matrix, and we want to find a perfect phylogeny for this matrix using a minimum number of flips, that is, corrections of single entries in the matrix. The graph-theoretical formulation of the problem is as follows: Given a bipartite graphG= (VtâˆªVc,E), the task is to find a minimum set of edge modifications such that the resulting graph has no induced path with four edges that starts and ends inVt, whereVtcorresponds to the taxa set andVccorresponds to the character set.We present two fixed-parameter algorithms for theMinimum-Flip Problem, one with running timeO(4.83k+poly(m,n)) and another one with running timeO(4.42k+poly(m,n)) forntaxa,mcharacters,kflips, andpoly(m,n) denotes a polynomial function inmandn. Additionally, we discuss several heuristic improvements. We also report computational results on phylogenetic data.
