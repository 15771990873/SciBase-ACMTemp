We consider the dynamic vertical ray shooting problem against horizontal disjoint segments, that is, the task of maintaining a dynamic setSofnnonintersecting horizontal line segments in the plane under a query that reports the first segment inSintersecting a vertical ray from a query point. We develop a linear-size structure that supports queries, insertions, and deletion inO(logn) worst-case time. Our structure works in the comparison model on a random access machine.
