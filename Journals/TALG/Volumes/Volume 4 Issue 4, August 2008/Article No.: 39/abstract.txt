We present a simple algorithm which maintains the topological order of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) withnnodes, under an online edge insertion sequence, inO(n2.75) time, independent of the numbermof edges inserted. For dense DAGs, this is an improvement over the previous best result ofO(min{m3/2logn,m3/2+n2logn}) by Katriel and Bodlaender [2006]. We also provide an empirical comparison of our algorithm with other algorithms for incremental topological sorting.
