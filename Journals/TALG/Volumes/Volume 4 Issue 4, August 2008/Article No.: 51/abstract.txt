We consider a fault-tolerant generalization of the classical uncapacitated facility location problem, where each clientjhas a requirement thatrjdistinctfacilities serve it, instead of just one. We give a 2.076-approximation algorithm for this problem using LP rounding, which is currently the best-known performance guarantee. Our algorithm exploits primal and dual complementary slackness conditions and is based onclustered randomized rounding. A technical difficulty that we overcome is the presence of terms with negative coefficients in the dual objective function, which makes it difficult to bound the cost in terms of dual variables. For the case where all requirements are the same, we give a primal-dual 1.52-approximation algorithm.We also consider a fault-tolerant version of thek-median problem. In the metrick-median problem, we are givennpoints in a metric space. We must selectkof these to be centers, and then assign each input pointjto the selected center that is closest to it. In the fault-tolerant version we wantjto be assigned torjdistinct centers. The goal is to select thekcenters so as to minimize the sum of assignment costs. The primal-dual algorithm for fault-tolerant facility location with uniform requirements also yields a 4-approximation algorithm for the fault-tolerantk-median problem for this case. This the first constant-factor approximation algorithm for the uniform requirements case.
