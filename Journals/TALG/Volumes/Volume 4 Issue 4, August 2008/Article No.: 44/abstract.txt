We investigate deterministic algorithms for a frequency assignment problem in cellular networks. The problem can be modeled as a special vertex coloring problem for hypergraphs: In every hyperedge there must exist a vertex with a color that occurs exactly once in the hyperedge (the conflict-free property). We concentrate on a special case of the problem, called conflict-free coloring for intervals. We introduce a hierarchy of four models for the aforesaid problem: (i) static, (ii) dynamic offline, (iii) dynamic online with absolute positions, and (iv) dynamic online with relative positions. In the dynamic offline model, we give a deterministic algorithm that uses at most log3/2n+ 1 &;approx; 1.71 log2ncolors and show inputs that force any algorithm to use at least 3 log5n+ 1 &approx; 1.29 log2ncolors. For the online absolute-positions model, we give a deterministic algorithm that uses at most 3⌈log3n⌉ &approx; 1.89 log2ncolors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deterministic online algorithm usingO(logn) colors in a nontrivial online model. In the online relative-positions model, we resolve an open problem by showing a tight analysis on the number of colors used by the first-fit greedy online algorithm. We also consider conflict-free coloring only with respect to intervals that contain at least one of the two extreme points.
