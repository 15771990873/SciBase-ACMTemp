We consider the problems of set partitioning intokclusters with minimum total cost and minimum of the maximum cost of a cluster. The cost function is given by an oracle, and we assume that it satisfies some natural structural constraints. That is, we assume that the cost function is monotone, the cost of a singleton is zero, and we assume that for allS∩ S′ &neq; ∅ the following holdsc(S) +c(S′) ≥c(S∪S′). For the problem of minimizing the maximum cost of a cluster we present a (2k− 1)-approximation algorithm fork≥ 3, a 2-approximation algorithm fork&equals; 2, and we also show a lower bound ofkon the performance guarantee of any polynomial-time algorithm. For the problem of minimizing the total cost of all the clusters, we present a 2-approximation algorithm for the case wherekis a fixed constant, a (4k− 3)-approximation wherekis unbounded, and we show a lower bound of 2 on the approximation ratio of any polynomial-time algorithm. Our lower bounds do not depend on the common assumption thatP&neq;NP.
