Efficient sensitivity analysis algorithms are presented for two problems arising in the study of Markov models of sequence evolution: ancestral reconstruction in evolutionary trees and local ungapped alignment under log-odds scoring. The algorithms generate complete descriptions of the optimum solutions for all possible values of the evolutionary distance. The running time for the parametric ancestral reconstruction problem under the Kimura 2-parameter model isO(kn+kn2/3logk), wherenis the number of sequences andkis their length, assuming all edges have the same length. For the parametric gapless alignment problem under the Jukes-Cantor model, the running time isO(mn+mn2/3logm), wheremandnare the sequence lengths andnâ‰¤m.
