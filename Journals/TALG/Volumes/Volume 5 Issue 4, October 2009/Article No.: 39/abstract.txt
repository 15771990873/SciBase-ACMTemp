LetGbe ann-vertexm-edge graph with weighted vertices. A pair of vertex setsA,B⊆V(G) is a 2/3-separationoforder&verbar;A∩B&verbar; ifA∪B&equals;V(G), there is no edge betweenA−BandB−A, and bothA−BandB−Ahave weight at most 2/3 the total weight ofG. Let &ell; ∈ Z+be fixed. Alon et al. [1990] presented an algorithm that inO(n1/2m) time, outputs either aK&ell;-minor ofG, or a separation ofGof orderO(n1/2). Whether there is aO(n+m)-time algorithm for this theorem was left as an open problem. In this article, we obtain aO(n+m)-time algorithm at the expense of aO(n2/3) separator. Moreover, our algorithm exhibits a trade-off between time complexity and the order of the separator. In particular, for any given &epsi; ∈ [0,1/2], our algorithm outputs either aK&ell;-minor ofG, or a separation ofGwith orderO(n(2−&epsi;)/3inO(n1 + &epsi;+m) time. As an application we give a fast approximation algorithm for finding an independent set in a graph with noK&ell;-minor.
