We study an optimization problem that arises in the context of data placement in a multimedia storage system. We are given a collection ofMmultimedia objects (data objects) that need to be assigned to a storage system consisting ofNdisksd1,d2…,dN. We are also given setsU1,U2,…,UMsuch thatUiis the set of clients seeking theith data object. Each diskdjis characterized by two parameters, namely, itsstorage capacityCjwhich indicates the maximum number of data objects that may be assigned to it, and aload capacityLjwhich indicates the maximum number of clients that it can serve. The goal is to find a placement of data objects to disks and an assignment of clients to disks so as to maximize the total number of clients served, subject to the capacity constraints of the storage system.We study this data placement problem for two natural classes of storage systems, namely,homogeneousanduniform ratio. We show that an algorithm developed by Shachnai and Tamir [2000a] for data placement achieves thebest possibleabsolute bound regarding the number of clients that can always be satisfied. We also show how to implement the algorithm so that it has a running time ofO((N+M) log(N+M)). In addition, we design a polynomial-time approximation scheme, solving an open problem posed in the same paper.
