We consider the problem of computing the distance between two piecewise-linear bivariate functionsfandgdefined over a common domainM, induced by theL2norm—that is, &Verbar;f−g&Verbar;2 &equals; &sqrt;∫M(f−g)2. Iffis defined by linear interpolation over a triangulation ofMwithntriangles andgis defined over another such triangulation, the obvious naive algorithm requires Θ(n2) arithmetic operations to compute this distance. We show that it is possible to compute it inO(nlog4nlog logn) arithmetic operations by reducing the problem to multipoint evaluation of a certain type of polynomials.We also present several generalizations and an application to terrain matching.
