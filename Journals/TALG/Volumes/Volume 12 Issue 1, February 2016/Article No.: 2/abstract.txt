We study thek-route cut problem: given an undirected edge-weighted graphG&equals; (V,E), a collection &lcub;(s1,t1), (s2,t2), …, (sr,tr)&rcub; of source-sink pairs, and an integer connectivity requirementk, the goal is to find a minimum-weight subsetE′ of edges to remove, such that the connectivity of every pair (si,ti) falls belowk. Specifically, in the edge-connectivity version, EC-kRC, the requirement is that there are at most (k− 1) edge-disjoint paths connectingsitotiinG&setmn;E′, while in the vertex-connectivity version, VC-kRC, the same requirement is for vertex-disjoint paths. Prior to our work, poly-logarithmic approximation algorithms have been known for the special case wherek&les; 3, but no non-trivial approximation algorithms were known for any valuek> 3, except in the single-source setting. We show anO(klog3/2r)-approximation algorithm for EC-kRC with uniform edge weights, and several polylogarithmic bi-criteria approximation algorithms for EC-kRC and VC-kRC, where the connectivity requirementkis violated by a constant factor. We complement these upper bounds by proving that VC-kRC is hard to approximate to within a factor ofk&epsi;for some fixed &epsi; > 0. We then turn to study a simpler version of VC-kRC, where only one source-sink pair is present. We give a simple bi-criteria approximation algorithm for this case, and show evidence that even this restricted version of the problem may be hard to approximate. For example, we prove that the single source-sink pair version of VC-kRC has no constant-factor approximation, assuming Feige’s Random κ-AND assumption.
