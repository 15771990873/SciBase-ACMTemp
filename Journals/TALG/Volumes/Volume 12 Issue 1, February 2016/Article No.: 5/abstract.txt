In this article, we show how to compute the width of a dynamic set of low-dimensional points in the streaming model. In particular, we assume that the stream contains both insertions of points and deletions of points to a setS, and the goal is to compute the width of the setS, namely the minimal distance between two parallel hyperplanes sandwiching the point setS.Our algorithm (1 &plus; &epsi;) approximates the width of the setSusing space polylogarithmic in the size ofSand the aspect ratio ofS. This is the first such algorithm that supports both insertions and deletions of points to the setS: previous algorithms for approximating the width of a point set only supported additions [Agarwal et al. 2004; Chan 2006], or a sliding window [Chan and Sadjad 2006].This solves an open question from the “2009 Kanpur list” of open problems in data streams, property testing, and related topics [Indyk et al. 2011].
