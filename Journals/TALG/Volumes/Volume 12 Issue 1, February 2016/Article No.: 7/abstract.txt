A maximal matching can be maintained in fully dynamic (supporting both addition and deletion of edges)n-vertex graphs using a trivial deterministic algorithm with a worst-case update time ofO(n). No deterministic algorithm that outperforms the naïveO(n) one was reported up to this date. The only progress in this direction is due to Ivkovi&cacute; and Lloyd, who in 1993 devised a deterministic algorithm with anamortizedupdate time ofO((n+m)&sqrt;2/2), wheremis the number of edges.In this article, we show the first deterministic fully dynamic algorithm that outperforms the trivial one. Specifically, we provide a deterministic worst-case update time ofO(&sqrt;m). Moreover, our algorithm maintains a matching, which in fact is a 3/2-approximate maximum cardinality matching (MCM). We remark that no fully dynamic algorithm for maintaining (2 − &epsi;)-approximate MCM improving upon the naïveO(n) was known prior to this work, even allowing amortized time bounds and randomization.For low arboricity graphs (e.g., planar graphs and graphs excluding fixed minors), we devise another simple deterministic algorithm with sublogarithmic update time. Specifically, it maintains a fully dynamic maximal matching with amortized update time ofO(logn/log logn). This result addresses an open question of Onak and Rubinfeld [2010].We also show a deterministic algorithm with optimal space usage, which for arbitrary graphs maintains a maximal matching in amortizedO(&sqrt;m) time and uses onlyO(n+m) space.
