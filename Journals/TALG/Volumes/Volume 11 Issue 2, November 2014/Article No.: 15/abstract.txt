We investigate the parameterized complexity ofVertex Coverparameterized by the difference between the size of the optimal solution and the value of the linear programming (LP) relaxation of the problem. By carefully analyzing the change in the LP value in the branching steps, we argue that combining previously known preprocessing rules with the most straightforward branching algorithm yields anO&ast;(2.618k) algorithm for the problem. Here,kis the excess of the vertex cover size over the LP optimum, and we writeO&ast;(f(k)) for a time complexity of the formO(f(k)nO(1)). We proceed to show that a more sophisticated branching algorithm achieves a running time ofO&ast;(2.3146k).Following this, using previously known as well as new reductions, we giveO&ast;(2.3146k) algorithms for the parameterized versions ofAbove Guarantee Vertex Cover,Odd Cycle Transversal,Split Vertex Deletion,andAlmost 2-SAT, andO&ast;(1.5214k) algorithms forKönig Vertex DeletionandVertex Coverparameterized by the size of the smallest odd cycle transversal and König vertex deletion set. These algorithms significantly improve the best known bounds for these problems. The most notable improvement among these is the new bound forOdd Cycle Transversal—this is the first algorithm that improves on the dependence onkof the seminalO&ast;(3k) algorithm of Reed, Smith, and Vetta. Finally, using our algorithm, we obtain a kernel for the standard parameterization ofVertex Coverwith at most 2k−clogkvertices. Our kernel is simpler than previously known kernels achieving the same size bound.
