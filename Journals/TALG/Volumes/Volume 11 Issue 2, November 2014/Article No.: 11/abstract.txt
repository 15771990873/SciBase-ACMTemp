We consider maintaining a dynamic setSofNhorizontal segments in &Ropf;2such that, given a vertical rayQin &Ropf;2, the segments inSintersectingQcan be reported efficiently. In the external memory model, we give a structure that consumesO(N/B) space, answers a query inO(logBN&plus;K/B) time (whereKis the number of reported segments), and can be updated inO(logBN) amortized time per insertion and deletion. WithBset to a constant, the structure also works in internal memory, consuming spaceO(N), answering a query inO(logN&plus;K) time, and supporting an update inO(logN) amortized time.
