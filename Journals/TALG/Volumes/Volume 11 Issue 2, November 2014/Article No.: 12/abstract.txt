Two equal-length strings, or two equal-sized two-dimensional texts,parameterize match(p-match) if there is a one-one mapping (relative to the alphabet) of their characters.Two-dimensional parameterized matchingis the task of finding allm×msubstrings of ann×ntext that p-match anm×mpattern. This models searching for color images with changing of color maps, for example. We present two algorithms that solve the two-dimensional parameterized matching problem. The time complexities of our algorithms areO(n2log2m) andO(n2&plus;m2.5polylog(m)). Our algorithms are faster than theO(n2mlog2mlog logm) time algorithm for this problem of Amir et al. [2006].A key step in both of our algorithms is to count the number of distinct characters in everym×msubstring of ann×nstring. We show how to solve this problem inO(n2) time. This result may be of independent interest.
