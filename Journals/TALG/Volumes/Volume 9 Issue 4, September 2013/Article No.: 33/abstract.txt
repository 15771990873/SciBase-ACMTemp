We analyze the Matrix Berlekamp/Massey algorithm, which generalizes the Berlekamp/Massey algorithm [Massey 1969] for computing linear generators of scalar sequences. The Matrix Berlekamp/Massey algorithm computes a minimal matrix generator of a linearly generated matrix sequence and has been first introduced by Rissanen [1972a], Dickinson et al. [1974], and Coppersmith [1994]. Our version of the algorithm makes no restrictions on the rank and dimensions of the matrix sequence. We also give new proofs of correctness and complexity for the algorithm, which is based on self-contained loop invariants and includes an explicit termination criterion for a given determinantal degree bound of the minimal matrix generator.
