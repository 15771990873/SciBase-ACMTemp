In Gandhi et al. [2006], we gave an algorithm for the data migration and non-deterministic open shop scheduling problems in the minimum sum version, that was claimed to achieve a 5.06-approximation. Unfortunately, it was pointed to us by Maxim Sviridenko that the argument contained an unfounded assumption that has eluded all of its readers until now. We detail in this document how this error can be amended. A side effect is an improved approximation ratio of 4.96.
