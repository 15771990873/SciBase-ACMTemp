Online auction is the essence of many modern markets, particularly networked markets, in which information about goods, agents, and outcomes is revealed over a period of time, and the agents must make irrevocable decisions without knowing future information. Optimal stopping theory, especially the classicsecretary problem, is a powerful tool for analyzing such online scenarios which generally require optimizing an objective function over the input. The secretary problem and its generalization themultiple-choice secretary problemwere under a thorough study in the literature. In this article, we consider a very general setting of the latter problem called thesubmodular secretary problem, in which the goal is to selectksecretaries so as to maximize the expectation of a (not necessarily monotone) submodular function which defines efficiency of the selected secretarial group based on their overlapping skills. We present the first constant-competitive algorithm for this case. In a more general setting in which selected secretaries should form an independent (feasible) set in each oflgiven matroids as well, we obtain anO(llog2r)-competitive algorithm generalizing several previous results, whereris the maximum rank of the matroids. Another generalization is to considerlknapsack constraints (i.e., a knapsack constraint assigns a nonnegative cost to each secretary, and requires that the total cost of all the secretaries employed be no more than a budget value) instead of the matroid constraints, for which we present anO(l)-competitive algorithm. In a sharp contrast, we show for a more general setting ofsubadditive secretary problem, there is noõ(√n)-competitive algorithm and thus submodular functions are the most general functions to consider for constant-competitiveness in our setting. We complement this result by giving a matchingO(√n)-competitive algorithm for the subadditive case. At the end, we consider some special cases of our general setting as well.
