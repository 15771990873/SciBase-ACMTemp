We study the parameterized complexity of thek-center problem on a givenn-point setPin &ℝd, with the dimensiondas the parameter. We show that the rectilinear 3-center problem is fixed-parameter tractable, by giving an algorithm that runs inO(nlogn) time for any fixed dimensiond. On the other hand, we show that this is unlikely to be the case with both the Euclidean and rectilineark-center problems for anyk≥ 2 andk≥ 4 respectively. In particular, we prove that deciding whetherPcan be covered by the union of 2 balls of given radius or by the union of 4 cubes of given side length is W[1]-hard with respect tod, and thus not fixed-parameter tractable unless FPT=W[1]. For the Euclidean case, we also show that even anno(d)-time algorithm does not exist, unless there is a 2o(n)-time algorithm forn-variable 3SAT, that is, the Exponential Time Hypothesis fails.
