An out-treeTof a directed graphDis a rooted tree subgraph with all arcs directed outwards from the root. An out-branching is a spanning out-tree. By &ell;(D) and &ell;s(D), we denote the maximum number of leaves over all out-trees and out-branchings ofD, respectively.We give fixed parameter tractable algorithms for deciding whether &ell;s(D) ≥kand whether &ell;(D) ≥kfor a digraphDonnvertices, both with time complexity 2O(klogk)·nO(1). This answers an open question whether the problem for out-branchings is in FPT, and improves on the previous complexity of 2O(klog2k)·nO(1)in the case of out-trees.To obtain the complexity bound in the case of out-branchings, we prove that when all arcs ofDare part of at least one out-branching, &ell;s(D) ≥ &ell;(D)/3. The second bound we prove in this article states that for strongly connected digraphsDwith minimum in-degree 3, &ell;s(D) ≥ Θ(&sqrt;n), where previously &ell;s(D) ≥ Θ(3&sqrt;n) was the best known bound. This bound is tight, and also holds for the larger class of digraphs with minimum in-degree 3 in which every arc is part of at least one out-branching.
