We study the problem of finding a most profitable subset ofngiven tasks, each with a given start and finish time as well as profit and resource requirement, that at no time exceeds the quantityBof available resource. We show that this NP-hard Resource Allocation problem can be (1/2 âˆ’ &epsiv;)-approximated in randomized polynomial time, which improves upon earlier approximation results.
