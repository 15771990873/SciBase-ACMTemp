We introduce CrossY, a simple drawing application developed as a benchmark to demonstrate the feasibility of goal-crossing as the basis for a graphical user interface. While crossing was previously identified as a potential substitute for the classic point-and-click interaction, this work is the first to report on the practical aspects of implementing an interface solely based on goal-crossing.
