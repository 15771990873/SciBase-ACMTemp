We present a technique for mapping relief textures onto arbitrary polygonal models in real time, producing correct self-occlusions, interpenetrations, shadows and per-pixel lighting. The technique uses a pixel-driven formulation based on an efficient ray-height-field intersection implemented on the GPU. It has very low memory requirements, supports extreme close-up views of the surfaces and can be applicable to surfaces undergoing deformation.
