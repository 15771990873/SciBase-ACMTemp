We describe and analyze a subdivision scheme that generalizes bicubic spline subdivision to control nets with polar structure. Such control nets appear naturally for surfaces with the combinatorial structure of objects of revolution and at points of high valence in subdivision meshes. The resulting surfaces areC2except at a finite number of isolated points where the surface isC1and the curvature is bounded.
