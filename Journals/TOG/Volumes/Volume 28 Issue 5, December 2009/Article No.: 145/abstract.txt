This paper presents a fast deblurring method that produces a deblurring result from a single image of moderate size in a few seconds. We accelerate both latent image estimation and kernel estimation in an iterative deblurring process by introducing a novel prediction step and working with image derivatives rather than pixel values. In the prediction step, we use simple image processing techniques to predict strong edges from an estimated latent image, which will be solely used for kernel estimation. With this approach, a computationally efficient Gaussian prior becomes sufficient for deconvolution to estimate the latent image, as small deconvolution artifacts can be suppressed in the prediction. For kernel estimation, we formulate the optimization function using image derivatives, and accelerate the numerical process by reducing the number of Fourier transforms needed for a conjugate gradient method. We also show that the formulation results in a smaller condition number of the numerical system than the use of pixel values, which gives faster convergence. Experimental results demonstrate that our method runs an order of magnitude faster than previous work, while the deblurring quality is comparable. GPU implementation facilitates further speed-up, making our method fast enough for practical use.
