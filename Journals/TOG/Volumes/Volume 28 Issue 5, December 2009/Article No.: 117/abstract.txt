Diffusion curve images(DCI) provide a powerful tool for efficient 2D image generation, storage and manipulation. A DCI consist of curves with colors defined on either side. By diffusing these colors over the image, the final result includes sharp boundaries along the curves with smoothly shaded regions between them. This paper extends the application of diffusion curves to render high quality surface details on 3D objects. The first extension is a view dependent warping technique that dynamically reallocates texture space so that object parts that appear large on screen get more texture for increased detail. The second extension is adynamicfeature embedding technique that retains crisp, anti-aliased curve details even in extreme closeups. The third extension is the application of dynamic feature embedding to displacement mapping and geometry images. Our results show high quality renderings of diffusion curve textures, displacements, and geometry images, all rendered interactively.
