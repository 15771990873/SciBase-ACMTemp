Smooth parametric surfaces interpolating triangular meshes are very useful for modeling surfaces of arbitrary topology. Several interpolants based on these kind of surfaces have been developed over the last fifteen years. However, with current 3D acquisition equipments, models are becoming more and more complex. Since previous interpolation methods lack a local refinement property, there is no way to locally adapt the level of detail. In this article, we introduce a hierarchical triangular surface model. The surface is overall tangent plane continuous and is defined parametrically as a piecewise quintic polynomial. It can be adaptively refined while preserving the overall tangent plane continuity. This model enables designers to create a complex smooth surface of arbitrary topology composed of a small number of patches to which details can be added by locally refining the patches until an arbitrary small size is reached. It is implemented as a hierarchical data structure where the top layer describes a coarse, smooth base surface and the lower levels encode the details in local frame coordinates.
