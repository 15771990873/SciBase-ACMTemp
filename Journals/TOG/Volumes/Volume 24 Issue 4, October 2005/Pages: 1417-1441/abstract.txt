Recently, three-dimensional CAD systems based on feature-based solid modeling techniques have been widely used for product design. However, when part models associated with features are used in various downstream applications, simplified models at various levels of detail (LODs) are frequently more desirable than the full details of the parts. One challenge is to generate valid models at various LODs after an arbitrary rearrangement of features using a certain LOD criterion, because composite Boolean operations consisting of union and subtraction are not commutative. This article proposes an algorithm for feature-based multiresolution solid modeling based on the effective volumes of features. This algorithm guarantees the same resulting shape and the reasonable intermediate LOD models for an arbitrary rearrangement of the features, regardless of whether feature types are additive or subtractive. This characteristic enables various LOD criteria to be used for a wide range of applications including computer-aided design and analysis.
