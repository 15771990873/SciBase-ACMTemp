In this article, we present a procedural object distribution function, a new texture basis function that distributes procedurally generated objects over a procedurally generated texture. The objects are distributed uniformly over the texture, and are guaranteed not to overlap. The scale, size, and orientation of the objects can be easily manipulated. The texture basis function is efficient to evaluate, and is suited for real-time applications. The new texturing primitive we present extends the range of textures that can be generated procedurally.The procedural object distribution function we propose is based on Poisson disk tiles and a direct stochastic tiling algorithm for Wang tiles. Poisson disk tiles are square tiles filled with a precomputed set of Poisson disk distributed points, inspired by Wang tiles. A single set of Poisson disk tiles enables the real-time generation of an infinite amount of Poisson disk distributions of arbitrary size. With the direct stochastic tiling algorithm, these Poisson disk distributions can be evaluated locally, at any position in the Euclidean plane.Poisson disk tiles and the direct stochastic tiling algorithm have many other applications in computer graphics. We briefly explore applications in object distribution, primitive distribution for illustration, and environment map sampling.
