In this article functional equations are used to characterize some families of surfaces. First, the most general surfaces in implicit formf(x, y, z) = 0, such that any arbitrary intersection with the planesz=z0,y=y0, andx=x0are linear combinations of sets of functions of the other two variables, are characterized. It is shown that only linear combinations of tensor products of univariate functions are possible forfx,y,z). Second, we obtain the most general families of surfaces in explicit form such that  their intersections with planes parallel to the planesy= 0 andx= 0 belong to two, not necessarily equal, parametric families of curves. Finally, functional equations are used to analyze the uniqueness of representation of Gordon-Coon surfaces. Some practical examples are used to illustrate the theoretical results.
