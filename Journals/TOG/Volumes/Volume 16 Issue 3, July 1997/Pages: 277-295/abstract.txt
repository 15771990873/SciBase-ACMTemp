We present an algorithm for generating a twice-differentiable curve on the rotation group SO(3) that interpolated a given ordered set of rotation matrices at their specified knot times. In our approach we regard SO(3) as a Lie group with a bi-invariant Riemannian metriac, and apply the coordinate-invariant methods of Riemannian geometry. The resulting rotation curve is easy to compute, invariant with respect to fixed and moving reference frames, and also approximately minimizes angular acceleration.
