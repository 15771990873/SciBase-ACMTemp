Supersampling is widely used by graphics hardware to render anti-aliased images. In conventional supersampling, multiple scene samples are computationally combined to produce a single screen pixel. We consider a novel imaging paradigm that we calldisplay supersampling, where multiple display samples are physically combined via the superimposition of multiple image subframes. Conventional anti-aliasing and texture mapping techniques are shown inadequate for the task of rendering high-quality images on supersampled displays. Instead of requiring anti-aliasing filters, supersampled displays actually require alias generation filters to cancel the aliasing introduced by nonuniform sampling. We present fundamental theory and efficient algorithms for the real-time rendering of high-resolution anti-aliased images on supersampled displays. We show that significant image quality gains are achievable by taking advantage of display supersampling. We prove that alias-free resolution beyond the Nyquist limits of a single subframe may be achieved by designing a bank of alias-canceling rendering filters. In addition, we derive a practical noniterative filter bank approach to real-time rendering and discuss implementations on commodity graphics hardware.
