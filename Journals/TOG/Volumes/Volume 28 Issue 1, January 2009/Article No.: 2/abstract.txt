Panoramic maps combine the advantages of both ordinary geographic maps and terrestrial images. While inheriting the familiar perspective of terrestrial images, they provide a good overview and avoid occlusion of important geographical features. The designer achieves this by skillful choice and integration of several views in a single image. As important features on the surface must be carefully rearranged to guarantee their visibility, the manual design of panoramic maps requires many hours of tedious and painstaking work.In this article we take a variational approach to the design of panoramic maps. Starting from conventional elevation data and aerial images, our method fully automatically computes panoramic maps from arbitrary viewpoints. It rearranges geographic structures to maximize the visibility of a specified set of features while minimizing the deformation of the landscape's shape.
