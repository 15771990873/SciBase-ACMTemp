The behavior of a variety of phenomena measurable on the boundary of 3D shapes is studied by modeling the set of known measurements as a scalar functionf:P → R, defined on a surface P. Furthermore, the large amount of scientific data calls for efficient techniques to correlate, describe, and analyze this data. In this context, we focus on the problem of extending the measures captured by a scalar functionf, defined on the boundary surface P of a 3D shape, to its surrounding volume. This goal is achieved by computing a sequence of volumetric functions that approximatefup to a specified accuracy and preserve its critical points. More precisely, we compute a smooth mapg: R3→ R such that the piecewise linear functionh:&equals;gP : P → R, which interpolates the values ofgat the vertices of the triangulated surface P, is an approximation offwith the same critical points. In this way, we overcome the limitation of traditional approaches to function approximation, which are mainly based on a numerical error estimation and do not provide measurements of the topological and geometric features off. The proposed approximation scheme builds on the properties offrelated to itsglobal structure, that is, its critical points, and ignores the local details off, which can be successively introduced according to the target approximation accuracy.
