The continuity properties of recursively generated B-spline surfaces over an arbitrary topology have been related to the eigenproperties of the local subdivision transformation. In this paper a discrete Fourier transform technique is employed to derive these eigenproperties for a general choice of subdivision weightings. Conditions on these weightings are identified for tangent plane continuity at the extraordinary points and a geometric interpretation is given.
