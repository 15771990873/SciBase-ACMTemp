We present a study of a highly decomposable algorithm useful for the parallel generation of a contour surface display. The core component of this algorithm is a two-dimensional contouring algorithm that operates on a single 2 x 2 subgrid of a larger grid. An intuitive procedure for the operations used to generate the contour lines for a subgrid is developed. A data structure, the contouring tree, is introduced as the basis of a new algorithm for generating the contour lines for the subgrid. The construction of the contouring tree is detailed. Space requirements for the contouring tree algorithm are described for particular implementations.
