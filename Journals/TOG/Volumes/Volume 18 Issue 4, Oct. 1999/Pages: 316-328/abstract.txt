In this paper we give a simple method for drawing a closed rational curve specified in terms of control points as two Bézier segments. The main result is the following:For every affine frame(r,s)(wherer<s), for every rational curveF(t)specified over [r,s] by some control polygon
 (&bgr;0, …, &bgr;m) (where the &bgr;zeroare weighted control points or control vectors), the control points (&thgr;0,… ,&thgr;m(w.r.t.[r,s]) of the rational curveG(t)=F4tare given byqi=-1ibi,where4:RP1→RP1is the projectivity mapping [r,s] ontoRP1−]r,s]. Thus, in order to draw the entire trace of the curveFover-∞,+∞,  we simply draw the curve segmentsF[(r,s]) andG([r,s]).The correctness of the method is established using a simple geometric argument about ways of partitioning the real projective line into two disjoint segments. Other known methods for drawing rational curves can be justified using similar geometric arguments.
