Results from vision research are applied to the synthesis of visual texture for the purposes of information display. The literature surveyed suggests that the human visual system processes spatial information by means of parallel arrays of neurons that can be modeled by Gabor functions. Based on the Gabor model, it is argued that the fundamental dimensions of texture for human perception are orientation, size (1/frequency), and contrast. It is shown that there are a number of trade-offs in the density with which information can be displayed using texture. Two of these are (1) a trade-off between the size of the texture elements and the precision with which the location can be specified, and (2) the precision with which texture orientation can be specified and the precision with which texture size can be specified. Two algorithms for generating texture are included.
