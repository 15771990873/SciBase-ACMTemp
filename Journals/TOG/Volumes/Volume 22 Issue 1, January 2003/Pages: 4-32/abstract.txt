We present a unified anisotropic geometric diffusion PDE model for smoothing (fairing) out noise both in triangulated two-manifold surface meshes inIR3and functions defined on these surface meshes, while enhancing curve features on both by careful choice of an anisotropic diffusion tensor. We combine theC1limit representation of Loop's subdivision for triangular surface meshes and vector functions on the surface mesh with the established diffusion model to arrive at a discretized version of the diffusion problem in the spatial direction. The time direction discretization then leads to a sparse linear system of equations. Iteratively solving the sparse linear system yields a sequence of faired (smoothed) meshes as well as faired functions.
