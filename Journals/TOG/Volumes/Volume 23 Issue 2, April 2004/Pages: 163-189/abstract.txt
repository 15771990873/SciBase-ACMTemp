In the past twenty years, many algorithms have been proposed to compute global illumination in synthetic scenes. Typically, such approaches can deal with specific lighting configurations, but often have difficulties with others. In this article, we present a final reconstruction step for a novelunified approachto global illumination that automatically detects different types of light transfer and uses the appropriate method in a closely-integrated manner. With our approach, we can deal with difficult lighting configurations such as indirect nondiffuse illumination. The first step of this algorithm consists in a view-independent solution based on hierarchical radiosity with clustering, integrated with particle tracing. This first pass results in solutions containing directional effects such as caustics, which can be interactively rendered. The second step consists of a view-dependent final reconstruction that uses all existing information to compute higher quality, ray-traced images.
