In this article, we present an image-based modeling and rendering system, which we callpop-up light field, that models a sparse light field using a set ofcoherent layers. In our system, the user specifies how many coherent layers should be modeled or popped up according to the scene complexity. A coherent layer is defined as a collection of corresponding planar regions in the light field images. A coherent layer can be rendered free of aliasing all by itself, or against other background layers. To construct coherent layers, we introduce a Bayesian approach,coherence matting, to estimate alpha matting around segmented layer boundaries by incorporating a coherence prior in order to maintain coherence across images.We have developed an intuitive and easy-to-use user interface (UI) to facilitate pop-up light field construction. The key to our UI is the concept of human-in-the-loop where the user specifies where aliasing occurs in the rendered image. The user input is reflected in the input light field images where pop-up layers can be modified. The user feedback is instant through a hardware-accelerated real-time pop-up light field renderer. Experimental results demonstrate that our system is capable of rendering anti-aliased novel views from a sparse light field.
