The linearParameter Plane Transform (PPT)of a height field attributes an inverted cone of empty space to each height field cell. In is known that height field ray-tracing efficiency can be improved by traversing rays in steps across inverted cones of empty space. However, steps across inverted cones of empty space along rays close to the base of a steep ridge will be short, even if there are no obstructions along the line of sight, because the cones will be narrow. This weakness can be virtually eliminated by allowing the opening angles of the inverted cones of empty space to vary between sectors, i.e., by directionalizing the linear PPT. An efficient algorithm for computing the linear directional PPT of a height field is given and its properties are  investigated.
