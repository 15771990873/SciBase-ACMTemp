An intersection detection method for solid modeling which is invariant under projective transformations is presented. We redefine the fundamental geometric figures necessary to describe solid models and their dual figures in a homogeneous coordinate representation. Then we derive conditions, which are projectively invariant, for intersections between these primitives. We will show that a geometric processor based on the 4 x 4 determinant method is applicable to a wide range of problems with little modification. This method has applications in intersection detections of rational parametric curves and surfaces and hidden-line/surface removal algorithms.
