This paper describes a new interactive environment for user interface specification which is based on an enhanced spreadsheet model of computation. This environment allows sophisticated graphical user interfaces with dynamic feedback to be implemented with little or no explicit programming. Its goal is to support user interface specification by nonprogramming experts in human factors, visual design, or the application domain. In addition, the system is designed to allow sophisticated end-users to modify and customize their own interfaces. The system is based on a data flow model of computation. This model is presented to the interface designer in the form of a spreadsheet enhanced with new constructs for easier programming and reuse. These constructs include an improved interactive programming environment, a prototype-instance-based inheritance system, support for composition, abstraction, and customization using indirect references, the addition of support for graphical inputs and outputs, and support for the encapsulation of application data structures and routines within system objects.
