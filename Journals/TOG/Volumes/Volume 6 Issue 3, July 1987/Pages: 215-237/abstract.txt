The interaction of light with particles suspended in the air is the cause of some beautiful effects. Among these effects are the colors of the sunset, the blue of the sky, and the appearance of a scene in fog. A lighting model that takes into account the effects of scattering by suspended particles is presented. A method of computing the colors of the sun and sky, for any sun position above the horizon, is derived from the lighting model. The model is also suitable for rendering fog under general lighting conditions. As an example of the use of the model for rendering fog, the special case of fog lit by the sun, without shadows, is considered.
