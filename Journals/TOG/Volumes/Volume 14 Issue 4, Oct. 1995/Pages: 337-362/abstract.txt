In this paper we introduce B-spline illumination maps and their generalizations and extensions for use in realistic image generation algorithms. The B-spline lighting functions (i.e., illumination maps) are defined as weighted probability density functions. The lighting functions can be estimated from random data and may be used in bidirectional distributed ray tracing programs as well as radiosity oriented algorithms. The use of these lighting functions in a bidirectional ray tracing system that can handle dispersion as well as the focusing of light through lenses is presented.
