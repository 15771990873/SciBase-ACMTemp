We present a feature-based technique for morphing 3D objects represented by light fields. Our technique enables morphing of image-based objects whose geometry and surface properties are too difficult to model with traditional vision and graphics techniques. Light field morphing is not based on 3D reconstruction; instead it relies onray correspondence,i.e., the correspondence between rays of the source and target light fields. We address two main issues in light field morphing: feature specification and visibility changes. For feature specification, we develop an intuitive and easy-to-use user interface (UI). The key to this UI isfeature polygons,which are intuitively specified as 3D polygons and are used as a control mechanism for ray correspondence in the abstract 4D ray space. For handling visibility changes due to object shape changes, we introduceray-space warping.Ray-space warping can fill arbitrarily large holes caused by object shape changes; these holes are usually too large to be properly handled by traditional image warping. Our method can deal with non-Lambertian surfaces, including specular surfaces (with dense light fields). We demonstrate that light field morphing is an effective and easy-to-use technqiue that can generate convincing 3D morphing effects.
