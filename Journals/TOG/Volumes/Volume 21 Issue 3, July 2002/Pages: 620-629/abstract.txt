Human hair modeling is a difficult task. This paper presents a constructive hair modeling system with which users can sculpt a wide variety of hairstyles. Our Multiresolution Hair Modeling (MHM) system is based on the observed tendency of adjacent hair strands to form clusters at multiple scales due to static attraction. In our system, initial hair designs are quickly created with a small set of hair clusters. Refinements at finer levels are achieved by subdividing these initial hair clusters. Users can edit an evolving model at any level of detail, down to a single hair strand. High level editing tools support curling, scaling, and copy/paste, enabling users to rapidly create widely varying hairstyles. Editing ease and model realism are enhanced by efficient hair rendering, shading, antialiasing, and shadowing algorithms.
