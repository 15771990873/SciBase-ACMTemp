We present a simple method of interactive texture editing that utilizes self-similarity to replicate intended operations globally over an image. Inspired by the recent successes of hierarchical approaches to texture synthesis, this method also uses multi-scale neighborhoods to assess the similarity of pixels within a texture. However, neighborhood matching is not employed to generate new instances of a texture. We instead locate similar neighborhoods for the purpose of replicating editing operations on the original texture itself, thereby creating a fundamentally new texture. This general approach is applied to texture painting, cloning and warping. These global operations are performed interactively, most often directed with just a single mouse movement.
