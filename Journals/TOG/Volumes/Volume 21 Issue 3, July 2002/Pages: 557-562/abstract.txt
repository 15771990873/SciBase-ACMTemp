Shadow maps are probably the most widely used means for the generation of shadows, despite their well known aliasing problems. In this paper we introduceperspective shadow maps,which are generated in normalized device coordinate space, i.e., after perspective transformation. This results in important reduction of shadow map aliasing with almost no overhead. We correctly treat light source transformations and show how to include all objects which cast shadows in the transformed space. Perspective shadow maps can directly replace standard shadow maps for interactive hardware accelerated rendering as well as in high-quality, offline renderers.
