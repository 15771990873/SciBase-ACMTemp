Cutting and pasting to combine different elements into a common structure are widely used operations that have been successfully adapted to many media types. Surface design could also benefit from the availability of a general, robust, and efficient cut-and-paste tool, especially during the initial stages of design when a large space of alternatives needs to be explored. Techniques to support cut-and-paste operations for surfaces have been proposed in the past, but have been of limited usefulness due to constraints on the type of shapes supported and the lack of real-time interaction. In this paper, we describe a set of algorithms based on multiresolution subdivision surfaces that perform at interactive rates and enable intuitive cut-and-paste operations.
