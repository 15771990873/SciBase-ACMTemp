We present a system that lets a designer directly annotate a 3D model with strokes, imparting a personal aesthetic to the non-photorealistic rendering of the object. The artist chooses a "brush" style, then draws strokes over the model from one or more viewpoints. When the system renders the scene from any new viewpoint, it adapts the number and placement of the strokes appropriately to maintain the original look.
