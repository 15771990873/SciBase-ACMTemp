In this paper we describe how to simulate geometrically complex, interactive, physically-based, volumetric, dynamic deformation models withnegligible main CPU costs.This is achieved using aDynamicResponseTexture,orDyRT,that can be mapped onto any conventional animation as an optional rendering stage using commodity graphics hardware. The DyRT simulation process employs precomputed modal vibration models excited by rigid body motions. We present several examples, with an emphasis on bone-based character animation for interactive applications.
