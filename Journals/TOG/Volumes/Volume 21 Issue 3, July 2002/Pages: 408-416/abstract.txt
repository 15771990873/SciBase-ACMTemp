In this paper we present a general method for rapid prototyping of realistic character motion. We solve for the natural motion from a simple animation provided by the animator. Our framework can be used to produce relatively complex realistic motion with little user effort.We describe a novel constraint detection method that automatically determines different constraints on the character by analyzing the input motion. We show that realistic motion can be achieved by enforcing a small set of linear and angular momentum constraints. This simplified approach helps us avoid the complexities of computing muscle forces. Simpler dynamic constraints also allow us to generate animations of models with greater complexity, performing more intricate motions. Finally, we show that by learning a small set of key parameters that describe a character pose we can help a non-skilled animator rapidly create realistic character motion.
