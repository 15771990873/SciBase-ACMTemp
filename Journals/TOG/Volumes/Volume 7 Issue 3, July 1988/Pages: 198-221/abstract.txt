This paper describes two algorithms for solving the following general problem: Given two polynomial maps f: Rn&map; RNand S RN&map; Rdin Bézier simplex form, find the composition map &Stilde; = S ° f in Bézier simplex form (typically,n≤N≤d≤ 3). One algorithm is more appropriate for machine implementation, while the other provides somewhat more geometric intuition. The composition algorithms can be applied to the following problems: evaluation, subdivision, and polynomial reparameterization of Bézier simplexes; joining Bézier curves with geometric continuity of arbitrary order; and the determination of the control nets of Bézier curves and triangular Bézier surface patches after they have undergone free-form deformations.
