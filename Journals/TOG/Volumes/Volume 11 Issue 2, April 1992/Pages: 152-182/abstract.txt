In this paper we describe algorithms for generating NC tool paths for machining of arbitrarily shaped 2 l/2 dimensional pockets with arbitrary islands. These pocketing algorithms are based on a new offsetting algorithm presented in this paper. Our offsetting algorithm avoids costly two-dimensional Boolean set operations, relatively expensive distance calculations, and the overhead of extraneous geometry, such as the Voronoi diagrams, used in other pocketing algorithms.
