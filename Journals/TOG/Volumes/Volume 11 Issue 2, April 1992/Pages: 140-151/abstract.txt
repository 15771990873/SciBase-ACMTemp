An algorithm to estimate subdivision depths for rational curves and surfaces is presented. The subdivision depth is not estimated for the given curve/surface directly. The algorithm computes a subdivision depth for the polynomial curve/surface of which the given rational curve/surface is the image under the standard perspective projection. This subdivision depth, however, guarantees the required flatness of the given curve/surface after the subdivision. This work has applications in surface rendering, surface/surface intersection, and mesh generation.
