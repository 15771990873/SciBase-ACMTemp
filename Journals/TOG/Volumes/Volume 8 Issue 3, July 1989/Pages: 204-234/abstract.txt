In this paper we introduce a class of surface patch representations, called S-patches, that unify and generalize triangular and tensor product BÃ©zier surfaces by allowing patches to be defined over any convex polygonal domain; hence, S-patches may have any number of boundary curves. Other properties of S-patches are geometrically meaningful control points, separate control over positions and derivatives along boundary curves, and a geometric construction algorithm based on de Casteljau's algorithm. Of special interest are the regular S-patches, that is, S-patches defined on regular domain polygons. Also presented is an algorithm for smoothly joining together these surfaces withCkcontinuity.
