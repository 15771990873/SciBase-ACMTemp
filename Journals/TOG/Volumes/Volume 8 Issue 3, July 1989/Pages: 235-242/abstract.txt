This paper develops and explains the construction of a piecewise quartic space curve that interpolates positional, tangent, and curvature data. The construction is local and explicit; that is, it does not involve the solution of equations. If only positional data are known, then the tangent and curvature data can he derived by simple local default rules. Another option is to reduce the degree of the curve or minimize the a-norm of its derivative by solving a diagonally dominant, banded, linear system.
