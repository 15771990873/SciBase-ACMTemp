Current graphics hardware can be used to generate shadows using either the shadow volume or shadow map techniques. However, the shadow volume technique requires access to a representation of the scence as a polygonal model, and handling the near plane clip correctly and efficiently is difficult; conversely, accurate shadow maps require high-precision texture map data representations, but these are not widely supported.We present a hybird of the shadow map and shadow volume approaches which does not have these difficulties and leverages high-performance polygon rendering. The scene is rendered from the point of view of the light source and a sampled depth map is recovered. Edge detection and a template-based reconstruction technique are used to generate a global shadow   volume  boundary surface, after which the pixels in shadow can be marked using only a one-bit stencil buffer and a single-pass rendering of the shadow volume boundary polygons. The simple form of our template-based reconstruction scheme simplifies capping the shadow volume after the near plane clip.
