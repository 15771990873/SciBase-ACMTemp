A constraint describes a relation that must be maintained. Constraints provide a useful mechanism to aid in the construction of interactive graphical user interfaces. They can be used to maintain consistency between data and a view of the data, to maintain consistency among multiple views, to specify layout, and to specify relations between events and responses for describing animations of interactive systems and event-driven simulations. Object-oriented techniques for constraint representation and satisfaction are presented, and a range of examples that demonstrate the practical use of static and temporal constraints for such purposes is presented. These examples include animations of algorithms and physics simulations, and constructing user-interface elements such as file browsers, views onto statistical data, and an interactive monitor or a simulated operating system.
