The continuity properties of recursively generated B-spline surfaces over an arbitrary topology have been related to the eigenproperties of the local subdivision tranformation, and conditions have been established on the subdivision weightings for tangent plane continuity at extraordinary points. In this paper, curves through an extradordinary point, which align in both the tagent and binormal direction, are identified, and their curvatures are compared either side of the point. Further restrictions on the subdivision weightings are derived to optimize the curvature properties of the surface. In general continuity of curvature is not attained.
