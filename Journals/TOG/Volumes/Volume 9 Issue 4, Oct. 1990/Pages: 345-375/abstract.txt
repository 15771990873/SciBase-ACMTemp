To print image data optimized for display on a color monitor, the red, green, and blue values that drive the display must be transformed into data that control the amounts of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black on the print. The differences in the way display and print images are produced have important consequences for the transformation. Matching the appearance of the monitor and print images may be impossible, and achieving satisfactory results is complex. A method for obtaining pleasing prints from display image data is presented. This method assumes that good results can be achieved by users who do not have extensive knowledge of color reproduction and who have a minimum of color measuring equipment available.
