A major bottleneck in many graphics displays is the time required to scan-convert straight line segments. Most manufacturers use hardware based on Bresenham's [5] line algorithm. In this paper an algorithm is developed based on the original Bresenham scan-conversion together with the symmetry first noted by Gardner [18] and a recent double-step technique [31]. This results in a speed-up of scan-conversion by a factor of approximately 4 as compared to the original Bresenham algorithm. Hardware implementations are simple and efficient since the property of using only shift and increment operations is preserved.
