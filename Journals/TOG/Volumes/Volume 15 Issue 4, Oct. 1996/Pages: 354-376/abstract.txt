Patterns used for supersampling in graphics have been analyzed from statistical and signal-processing viewpoints. We present an analysis based on a type of isotropic discrepancyâ€”how good patterns are at estimating the area in a region of defined type. We present algorithms for computing discrepancy relative to regions that are defined by rectangles, halfplanes, and higher-dimensional figures. Experimental evidence shows that popular supersampling patterns have discrepancies with better asymptotic behavior than random sampling, which is not inconsistent with theoretical bounds on discrepancy.
