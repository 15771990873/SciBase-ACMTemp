We present an augmented airbrush that allows novices to experience the art of spray painting. Inspired by the thriving field of smart tools, our handheld device uses 6DOF tracking, augmentation of the airbrush trigger, and a specialized algorithm to restrict the application of paint to a preselected reference image. Our device acts both as a physical spraying device and as an intelligent assistive tool, providing simultaneous manual and computerized control. Unlike prior art, here the virtual simulation guides the physical rendering (inverse rendering), allowing for a new spray painting experience with singular physical results. We present our novel hardware design, control software, and a user study that verifies our research objectives.
