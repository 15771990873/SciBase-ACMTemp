Simulating natural phenomena has always been a focal point for computer graphics research. Its importance goes beyond the production of appealing presentations, since research in this area can contribute to the scientific understanding of complex natural processes. The natural phenomena, known as the Aurora Borealis and Aurora Australis, are geomagnetic phenomena of impressive visual characteristics and remarkable scientific interest. Aurorae present a complex behavior that arises from interactions between plasma (hot, ionized gases composed of ions, electrons, and neutral atoms) and Earth's electromagnetic fields. Previous work on the visual simulation of auroral phenomena have focused on static physical models of their shape, modeled from primitives, like sine waves. In this article, we focus on the dynamic behavior of the aurora, and we present a physically-based model to perform 3D visual simulations. The model takes into account the physical parameters and processes directly associated with plasma flow, and can be extended to simulate the dynamics of other plasma phenomena as well as astrophysical phenomena. The partial differential equations associated with these processes are solved using a complete multigrid implementation of the electromagnetic interactions, leading to a simulation of the shape and motion of the auroral displays. In order to illustrate the applicability of our model, we provide simulation sequences rendered using a distributed forward mapping approach.
