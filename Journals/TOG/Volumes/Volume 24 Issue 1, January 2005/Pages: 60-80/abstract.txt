Spectral compression of the geometry of triangle meshes achieves
good results in practice, but there has been little or no
theoretical support for the optimality of this compression. We show
that, for certain classes of geometric mesh models, spectral
decomposition using the eigenvectors of the symmetric Laplacian of
the connectivity graph is equivalent to principal component
analysis on that class, when equipped with a natural probability
distribution. Our proof treats connected one-and two-dimensional
meshes with fixed convex boundaries, and is based on an asymptotic
approximation of the probability distribution in the
two-dimensional case. The key component of the proof is that the
Laplacian is identical, up to a constant factor, to the inverse
covariance matrix of the distribution of valid mesh geometries.
Hence, spectral compression is optimal, in the mean square error
sense, for these classes of meshes under some natural assumptions
on their distribution.
