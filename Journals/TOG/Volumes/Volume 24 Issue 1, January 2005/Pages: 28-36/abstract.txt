In this article, we present a subdivision scheme for mixed triangle/quad meshes that is <i>C</i><sup>2</sup> everywhere except for isolated, extraordinary points. The rules that we describe are the same as Stam and Loop's scheme [2003] except that we perform an unzipping pass prior to subdivision. This simple modification improves the smoothness along the ordinary triangle/quad boundary from <i>C</i><sup>1</sup> to <i>C</i><sup>2</sup>, and creates a scheme capable of subdividing arbitrary meshes. Finally, we end with a proof based on Levin and Levin's [2003] joint spectral radius calculation to show our scheme is indeed <i>C</i><sup>2</sup> along the triangle/quad boundary.
