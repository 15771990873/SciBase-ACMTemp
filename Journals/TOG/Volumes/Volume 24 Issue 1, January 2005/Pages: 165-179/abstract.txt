Adaptation of ballistic motion demands a technique that can make required adjustments in anticipation of flight periods when only some physically consistent changes are possible. This article describes a numerical procedure that adjusts a physically consistent motion to fulfill new adaptation requirements expressed in kinematic and dynamic constraints. This iterative procedure refines the original motion with a sequence of minimal adjustments, implicitly favoring motions that are similar to the original performance, and transforming any input motion, including those that are difficult to characterize with an objective function. In total, over twenty adaptations were generated from two recorded performances, a run and a jump, by varying foot placement, restricting muscle use, adding new environment constraints, and changing the length and mass of specific limbs.
