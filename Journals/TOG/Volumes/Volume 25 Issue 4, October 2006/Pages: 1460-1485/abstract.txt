We present a new globally smooth parameterization method for the triangulated surfaces of arbitrary topology. Given two orthogonal piecewise linear vector fields defined over the input mesh (typically the estimated principal curvature directions), our method computes two piecewise linear periodic functions, aligned with the input vector fields, by minimizing an objective function. The bivariate function they define is a smooth parameterization almost everywhere on the surface, except in the vicinity of singular vertices, edges, and triangles, where the derivatives of the parameterization vanish. We extract a quadrilateral chart layout from the parameterization function and propose an automatic procedure to detect the singularities, and fix them by splitting and reparameterizing the containing charts. Our method can construct both quasiconformal (angle preserving) and quasi-isometric (angle and area preserving) parameterizations. The more restrictive class of quasi-isometric parameterizations is constructed at the expense of introducing more singularities. The constructed parameterizations can be used for a variety of geometry processing applications. Since we can align the parameterization with the principal curvature directions, our result is particularly suitable for surface fitting and remeshing.
