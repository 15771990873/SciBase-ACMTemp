Rendering a polygonal surface with Phong normal interpolation allows shading to appear as it would for a true curved surface while maintaining the efficiency and simplicity of coarse polygonal geometry. However, this approximation fails in certain situations, especially for grazing viewing directions. Well-known problems include physically impossible reflections and implausible illumination. Some of these artifacts can be mitigated through special-case processing, although no universal or generally accepted approaches are available. In particular, all known solutions that guarantee that reflected rays will always point outward from the surface also create discontinuities in the reflection ray direction.We present a simple modification of Phong normal interpolation that allows physically plausible reflections and creates an appearance of a smooth surface. We introduce an additional scalar parameter that characterizes the deviation between per-vertex normals and per face normals and use it to adjust linearly interpolated normals. The proposed technique eliminates perceptually objectionable artifacts caused by inconsistencies between the shading and geometric normals while retaining most of the practical advantages and simplicity of the original Phong formulation.
