We perform co-analysis of a set of man-made 3D objects to allow the creation of novel instances derived from the set. We analyze the objects at the part level and treat theanisotropic part scalesas a shape style. The co-analysis then allowsstyle transferto synthesize new objects. The key to co-analysis is part correspondence, where a major challenge is the handling of large style variations and diverse geometric content in the shape set. We proposestyle-content separationas a means to address this challenge. Specifically, we define acorrespondence-freestyle signature for style clustering. We show that confining analysis to within a style cluster facilitates tasks such as co-segmentation, content classification, and deformation-driven part correspondence. With part correspondence between each pair of shapes in the set, style transfer can be easily performed. We demonstrate our analysis and synthesis results on several sets of man-made objects with style and content variations.
