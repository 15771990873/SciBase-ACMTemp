In this paper, we present an efficient method for simulating highly detailed large scale participating media such as the nuclear explosions shown in figure 1. We capture this phenomena by simulating the motion of particles in a fluid dynamics generated velocity field. A novel aspect of this paper is the creation of highly detailed three-dimensional turbulent velocity fields at interactive rates using a low to moderate amount of memory. The key idea is the combination of two-dimensional high resolution physically based flow fields with a moderate sized three-dimensional Kolmogorov velocity field tiled periodically in space.
