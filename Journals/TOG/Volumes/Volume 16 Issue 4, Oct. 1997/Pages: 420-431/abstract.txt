Given a polyhedron, construct a new polyhedron by connecting every edge-midpoint to its four neighboring edge-midpoints. This refinement rule yields aC1surface and the surface has a piecewise quadratic parametrozation except at a finite number of isolated points. We analyze and improve the construction.
