The standard bilinear interpolation on normal maps results in visual artifacts along sharp features, which are common for surfaces with creases, wrinkles, and dents. In many cases, spatially varying features, like the normals near discontinuity curves, are best represented as functions of the distance to the curve and the position along the curve. For high-quality interactive rendering at arbitrary magnifications, one needs to interpolate the distance field preserving discontinuity curves exactly.We present a real-time, GPU-based method for distance function and distance gradient interpolation which preserves discontinuity feature curves. The feature curves are represented by a set of quadratic Bezier curves, with minimal restrictions on their intersections. We demonstrate how this technique can be used for real-time rendering of complex feature patterns and blending normal maps with procedurally defined profiles near normal discontinuities.
