We propose the SOHO wavelet basisâ€”the first spherical Haar wavelet basis that is both orthogonal and symmetric, making it particularly well suited for the approximation and processing of all-frequency signals on the sphere. We obtain the basis with a novel spherical subdivision scheme that defines a partition acting as the domain of the basis functions. Our construction refutes earlier claims doubting the existence of a basis that is both orthogonal and symmetric. Experimental results for the representation of spherical signals verify that the superior theoretical properties of the SOHO wavelet basis are also relevant in practice.
