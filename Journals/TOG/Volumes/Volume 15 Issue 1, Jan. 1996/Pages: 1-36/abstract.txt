In a distributed ray tracer, the sampling strategy is the crucial part of the direct lighting calculation. Monte Carlo integration with importance sampling is used to carry out this calculation. Importance sampling involves the design of integrand-specific probability density functions that are used to generate sample points for the numerical quadrature. Probability density functions are presented that aid in the direct lighting calculation from luminaires of various simple shapes. A method for defining a probability density function over a set of luminaires is presented that allows the direct lighting calculation to be carried out with a number of sample points that is independent of the number of luminaires.
