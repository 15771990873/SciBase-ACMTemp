Goodman (Properties of Beta-splines.J. Approx. Theory 44, 2 (June 1985), 132-153) gave an explicit formula for cubic Beta-splines on a uniform knot sequence with varying &bgr;1 and &bgr;2 values at the knots. We establish an alternative explicit formula for cubic Beta-splines on a nonuniform knot sequence with constant &bgr;1 = 1 and varying &bgr;2 values at the knots. This alternative formula can also be used if the knot sequence contains multiple knots, and is useful for knot insertion. We show how to efficiently evaluate a cubic Beta-spline curve at many values using this formula. We introduce rational cubic Beta-spline curves and surfaces that have extra weight parameters for shape control, and show that they satisfy the same geometric continuity conditions and properties as nonrational cubic Beta-spline curves and surfaces.
