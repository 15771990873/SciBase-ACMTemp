We present an algorithm for synthesizing textures from an input sample. This patch-based sampling algorithm is fast and it makes high-quality texture synthesis a real-time process. For generating textures of the same size and comparable quality, patch-based sampling is orders of magnitude faster than existing algorithms. The patch-based sampling algorithm works well for a wide variety of textures ranging from regular to stochastic. By sampling patches according to a nonparametric estimation of the local conditional MRF density function, we avoid mismatching features across patch boundaries. We also experimented with documented cases for which pixel-based nonparametric sampling algorithms cease to be effective but our algorithm continues to work well.
