This paper describes a general-purpose programming technique, called Simulation of Simplicity, that can be used to cope with degenerate input data for geometric algorithms. It relieves the programmer from the task of providing a consistent treatment for every single special case that can occur. The programs that use the technique tend to be considerably smaller and more robust than those that do not use it. We believe that this technique will become a standard tool in writing geometric software.
