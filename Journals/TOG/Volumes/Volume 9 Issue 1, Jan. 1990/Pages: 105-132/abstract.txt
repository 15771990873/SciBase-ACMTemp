A detailed description of the implementation of a three-dimensional convex hull algorithm is given. The problems experienced in the production and testing of a correct and robust implementation of a geometric algorithm are discussed. Attention is paid to those issues that are often brushed over in the theoretical descriptions but cause errors in a real computation. These include degeneracies such as coplanar points, floating-point errors, and other special, but not necessarily degenerate, cases.
