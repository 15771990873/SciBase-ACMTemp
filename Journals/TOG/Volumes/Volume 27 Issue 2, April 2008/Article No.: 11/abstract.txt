In this article, we introducesketching reality, the process of converting a freehand sketch into a realistic-looking model. We apply this concept to architectural designs. As the sketch is being drawn, our system periodically interprets its 2.5D-geometry by identifying new junctions, edges, and faces, and then analyzing the extracted topology. The user can add detailed geometry and textures through sketches as well. This is possible through the use of databases that match partial sketches to models of detailed geometry and textures. The final product is a realistic texture-mapped 2.5D-model of the building. We show a variety of buildings that have been created using this system.
