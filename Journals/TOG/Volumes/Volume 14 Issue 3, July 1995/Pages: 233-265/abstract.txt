We examine various solutions to the global illumination problem, based on an exact mathematical analysis of the rendering equation. In addition to introducing efficient radiosity algorithms, we present a uniform approach to reformulate all of the basic radiosity equations used so far. Using hybrid methods we are able to analyze possible combinations of the view-dependent ray-tracing method and of the low-resolution radiosity-based method, and to offer new algorithms.
