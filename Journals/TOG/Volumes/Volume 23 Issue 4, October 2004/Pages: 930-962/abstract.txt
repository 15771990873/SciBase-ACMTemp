We present techniques for accelerated texture synthesis from example images. The key idea of our approach is to divide the task into two phases: analysis, and synthesis. During the analysis phase, which is performed once per sample texture, we generate a <i>jump map</i>. Using the jump map, the synthesis phase is capable of synthesizing texture similar to the analyzed example at interactive rates. We describe two such synthesis phase algorithms: one for creating images, and one for directly texturing manifold surfaces. We produce texture images at rates comparable to the fastest alternative algorithms, and produce textured surfaces an order of magnitude faster than current alternative approaches. We further develop a new, faster patch-based algorithm for image synthesis, which improves the quality of our results on ordered textures. We show how controls used for specifying texture synthesis on surfaces may be used on images as well, allowing interesting new image-based effects, and highlight modelling applications enabled by the speed of our approach.
