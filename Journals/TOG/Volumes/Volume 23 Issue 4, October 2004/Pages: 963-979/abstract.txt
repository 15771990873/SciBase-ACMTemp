Although display devices have been used for decades, they have functioned without taking into account the illumination of their environment. We present the concept of a lighting sensitive display (LSD)---a display that measures the incident illumination and modifies its content accordingly. An ideal LSD would be able to measure the 4D illumination field incident upon it and generate a 4D light field in response to the illumination. However, current sensing and display technologies do not allow for such an ideal implementation. Our initial LSD prototype uses a 2D measurement of the illumination field and produces a 2D image in response to it. In particular, it renders a 3D scene such that it always appears to be lit by the real environment that the display resides in. The current system is designed to perform best when the light sources in the environment are distant from the display, and a single user in a known location views the display.The displayed scene is represented by compressing a very large set of images (acquired or rendered) of the scene that correspond to different lighting conditions. The compression algorithm is a lossy one that exploits not only image correlations over the illumination dimensions but also coherences over the spatial dimensions of the image. This results in a highly compressed representation of the original image set. This representation enables us to achieve high quality relighting of the scene in real time. Our prototype LSD can render 640 Ã— 480 images of scenes under complex and varying illuminations at 15 frames per second using a 2 GHz processor. We conclude with a discussion on the limitations of the current implementation and potential areas for future research.
