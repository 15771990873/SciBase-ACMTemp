An extended subdivision surface (ESub) is a generalization of Catmull Clark and NURBS surfaces. Depending on the knot intervals and valences of the vertices and faces, Catmull Clark as well as NURBS patches can be generated using the extended subdivision rules. Moreover, an arbitrary choice of the knot intervals and the topology is possible. Special features like sharp edges and corners are consistently supported by setting selected knot intervals to zero or by applying special rules. Compared to the prior nonuniform rational subdivision surfaces (NURSS), the ESubs offer limit-point rules which are indispensable in many applications, for example, for computer-aided design or in adaptive visualization. The refinement and limit-point rules for our nonuniform, nonstationary scheme are obtained via a new method using local BÃ©zier control points. With our new surface, it is possible to start with existing Catmull Clark as well as NURBS models and to continue the modeling process using the extended subdivision options.
