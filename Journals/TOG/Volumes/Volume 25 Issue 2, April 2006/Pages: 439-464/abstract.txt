We propose an automatic method for finding symmetries of 3D shapes, that is, isometric transforms which leave a shape globally unchanged. These symmetries are deterministically found through the use of an intermediate quantity: the generalized moments. By examining the extrema and spherical harmonic coefficients of these moments, we recover the parameters of the symmetries of the shape. The computation for large composite models is made efficient by using this information in an incremental algorithm capable of recovering the symmetries of a whole shape using the symmetries of its subparts. Applications of this work range from coherent remeshing of geometry with respect to the symmetries of a shape to geometric compression, intelligent mesh editing, and automatic instantiation.
