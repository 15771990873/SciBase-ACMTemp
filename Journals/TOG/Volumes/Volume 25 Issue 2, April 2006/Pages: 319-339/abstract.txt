This paper presents an approach to automatically compute animations for virtual (human-like and robot) characters cooperating to move bulky objects in cluttered environments. The main challenge is to deal with 3D collision avoidance while preserving the believability of the agent's behaviors. To accomplish the coordinated task, a geometric and kinematic decoupling of the system is proposed. This decomposition enables us to plan a collision-free path for a reduced system, then to animate locomotion and grasping behaviors independently, and finally to automatically tune the animation to avoid residual collisions. These three steps are applied consecutively to synthesize an animation. The different techniques used, such as probabilistic path planning, locomotion controllers, inverse kinematics and path planning for closed kinematic chains are explained, and the way to integrate them into a single scheme is described.
