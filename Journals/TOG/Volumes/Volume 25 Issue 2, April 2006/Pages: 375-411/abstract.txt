We describe forward rasterization, a class of rendering algorithms designed for small polygonal primitives. The primitive is efficiently rasterized by interpolation between its vertices. The interpolation factors are chosen to guarantee that each pixel covered by the primitive receives at least one sample which avoids holes. The location of the samples is recorded with subpixel accuracy using a pair of offsets which are then used to reconstruct/resample the output image. Offset reconstruction has good static and temporal antialiasing properties. We present two forward rasterization algorithms, one that renders quadrilaterals and is suitable for scenes modeled with depth images like in image-based rendering by 3D warping, and one that renders triangles and is suitable for scenes modeled conventionally. When compared to conventional rasterization, forward rasterization is more efficient for small primitives and has better temporal antialiasing properties.
