Two incremental linear interpolation algorithms are derived and analyzed for speed and accuracy. The first is a version of a “simple” digital differential analyzer (DDA) employing fixed-point arithmetic, whereas the second is a new algorithm that uses only integral arithmetic and is a generalization of Bresenham's line-drawing algorithm. The new algorithm is shown to achieve perfect accuracy and, depending on the underlying processor, may be faster than the fixed-point algorithm.
