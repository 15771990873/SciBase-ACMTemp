In Part I, Markov chains were shown to be associated with solutions to several standard problems in computer-aided geometric design. Constraints on these Markov chains were also derived. Examples are given here of Markov chains that either satisfy some of these constraints or solve one of these problems. Subdivision matrices are also studied in special detail.
