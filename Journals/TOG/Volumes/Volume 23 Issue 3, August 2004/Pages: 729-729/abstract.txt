A passive wand tracked in 3D using computer vision techniques is explored as a new input mechanism for interacting with large displays. We demonstrate a variety of interaction techniques and visual widgets that exploit the affordances of the wand, resulting in an effective interface for large scale display interaction. The lack of any buttons or other electronics on the wand presents a challenge that we address by developing a set of gestures and postures to track and enable command input.
