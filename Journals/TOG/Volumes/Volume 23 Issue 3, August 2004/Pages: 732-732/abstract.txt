Many applications have used a head-mounted display (HMD), such as in virtual and mixed realities and telepresence. However, the field of view (FOV) of commercial HMD systems is too narrow for feeling immersion. In this paper, we propose a super-wide field of view head-mounted display consisting of an ellipsoidal mirror and a hyperboloidal curved mirror. The horizontal FOV of the proposed HMD is 180 degrees and includes the peripheral vision of humans. It increases the reality and immersion for users.
