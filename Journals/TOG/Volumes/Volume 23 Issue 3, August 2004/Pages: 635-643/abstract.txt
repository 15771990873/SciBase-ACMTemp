Volume textures aligned with a surface can be used to add topologically complex geometric detail to objects in an efficient way, while retaining an underlying simple surface structure.Adding a volume texture to a surface requires more than a conventional two-dimensional parameterization: a part of the space surrounding the surface has to be parameterized. Another problem with using volume textures for adding geometric detail is the difficulty in rendering implicitly represented surfaces, especially when they are changed interactively.In this paper we present algorithms for constructing and rendering volume-textured surfaces. We demonstrate a number of interactive operations that these algorithms enable.
