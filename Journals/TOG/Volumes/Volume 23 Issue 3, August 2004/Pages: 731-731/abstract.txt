We present the CAT (Control Action Table), a 6 degrees of freedom freestanding input device designed for interaction with Virtual Environments displayed on huge screens. Both isotonic and isometric sensing modes allow the user to easily and efficiently perform 3D interaction techniques. A 2D tablet fixed on the tabletop allows them to perform accurate 2D interaction techniques.
