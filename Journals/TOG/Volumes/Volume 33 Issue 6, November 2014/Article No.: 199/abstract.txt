We introduce a method for replacing the background in a video of a moving foreground subject, when both thesource videocapturing the subject, and thetarget videocapturing the new background scene, are natural videos, casually captured using a freely moving hand-held camera. We assume that the foreground subject has already been extracted, and focus on the challenging task of generating a video with a new background, such that the new background motion appears compatible with the original one. Failure to match the motion results in disturbingslippageormoonwalkartifacts, where the subject's feet appear to slide or slip over the ground. While matching the motion across the entire frame is impossible for scenes with differing geometry, we aim to match thelocal motionof the ground in the vicinity of the subject. This is achieved by reordering and warping the available target background frames in a manner that optimizes a suitably designed objective function.
