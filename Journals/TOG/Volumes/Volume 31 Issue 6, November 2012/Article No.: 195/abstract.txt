We propose a novel approach for image space adaptive sampling and filtering in Monte Carlo rendering. We use an iterative scheme composed of three steps. First, we adaptively distribute samples in the image plane. Second, we denoise the image using a non-linear filter. Third, we estimate the residual per-pixel error of the filtered rendering, and the error estimate guides the sample distribution in the next iteration. The effectiveness of our approach hinges on the use of a state of the art image denoising technique, which we extend to an adaptive rendering framework. A key idea is to split the Monte Carlo samples into two buffers. This improves denoising performance and facilitates variance and error estimation. Our method relies only on the Monte Carlo samples, allowing us to handle arbitrary light transport and lens effects. In addition, it is robust to high noise levels and complex image content. We compare our approach to a state of the art adaptive rendering technique based on adaptive bandwidth selection and demonstrate substantial improvements in terms of both numerical error and visual quality. Our framework is easy to implement on top of standard Monte Carlo renderers and it incurs little computational overhead.
