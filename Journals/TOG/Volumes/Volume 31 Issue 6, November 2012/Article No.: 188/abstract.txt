We present a fast, automatic method for accurately capturing full-body motion data using a single depth camera. At the core of our system lies a realtime registration process that accurately reconstructs 3D human poses from single monocular depth images, even in the case of significant occlusions. The idea is to formulate the registration problem in aMaximum A Posteriori(MAP) framework and iteratively register a 3D articulated human body model with monocular depth cues via linear system solvers. We integrate depth data, silhouette information, full-body geometry, temporal pose priors, and occlusion reasoning into a unified MAP estimation framework. Our 3D tracking process, however, requires manual initialization and recovery from failures. We address this challenge by combining 3D tracking with 3D pose detection. This combination not only automates the whole process but also significantly improves the robustness and accuracy of the system. Our whole algorithm is highly parallel and is therefore easily implemented on a GPU. We demonstrate the power of our approach by capturing a wide range of human movements in real time and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in our comparison against alternative systems such asKinect[2012].
