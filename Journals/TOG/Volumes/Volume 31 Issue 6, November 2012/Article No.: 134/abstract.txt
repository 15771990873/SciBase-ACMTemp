We present an automatic optimization approach to outfit synthesis. Given the hair color, eye color, and skin color of the input body, plus a wardrobe of clothing items, our outfit synthesis system suggests a set of outfits subject to a particular dress code. We introduce a probabilistic framework for modeling and applying dress codes that exploits a Bayesian network trained on example images of real-world outfits. Suitable outfits are then obtained by optimizing a cost function that guides the selection of clothing items to maximize the color compatibility and dress code suitability. We demonstrate our approach on the four most common dress codes:Casual, Sportswear, Business-Casual, andBusiness. A perceptual study validated on multiple resultant outfits demonstrates the efficacy of our framework.
