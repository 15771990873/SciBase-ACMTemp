We examine a class of algorithms for rasterizing algebraic curves based on an implicit form that can be evaluated cheaply in integer arithmetic using finite differences. These algorithms run fast and produce “optimal” digital output, where previously known algorithms have had serious limitations. We extend previous work on conic sections to the cubic and higher order curves, and we solve an important undersampling problem.
