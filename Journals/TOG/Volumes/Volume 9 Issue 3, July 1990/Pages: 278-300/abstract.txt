We present a new technique to display a scene of three-dimensional isothetic parallelepipeds (3D-rectangles), viewed from infinity along one of the coordinate axes (axial view). In this situation, there always exists a topological sorting of the 3D-rectangles based on the relation of occlusion (a dominance relation). The arising total order is used to generate the axial view, where the two-dimensional view of each 3D-rectangle is incrementally added, starting from the closest 3D-rectangle. The proposedscene-sensitivealgorithm runs in timeO(Nlog2N+dlogN), whereNis the number of 3D-rectangles anddis the number of edges of the display. This improves over the previously best known technique based on the same approach.
