We present a solution method that, compared to the traditional Gauss-Seidel approach, reduces the time required to simulate the dynamics of large systems of rigid bodies interacting through frictional contact by one to two orders of magnitude. Unlike Gauss-Seidel, it can be easily parallelized, which allows for the physics-based simulation of systems with millions of bodies. The proposedaccelerated projected gradient descent(APGD) method relies on an approach by Nesterov in which a quadratic optimization problem with conic constraints is solved at each simulation time step to recover the normal and friction forces present in the system. The APGD method is validated against experimental data, compared in terms of speed of convergence and solution time with the Gauss-Seidel and Jacobi methods, and demonstrated in conjunction with snow modeling, bulldozer dynamics, and several benchmark tests that highlight the interplay between the friction and cohesion forces.
