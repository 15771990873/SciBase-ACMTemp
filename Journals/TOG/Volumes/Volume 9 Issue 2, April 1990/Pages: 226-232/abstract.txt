Background:The gamut of a color CRT is defined by its three primary colors, each produced by a phosphor/electron gun combination. Light from the primaries combines additively, so the color gamut is a subset of a three dimensional vector space [1]. With the primaries as basis vectors normalized to 1.0, the color gamut is a unit cube, known as the RGB color geometry, since the three primaries are usually red, green, and blue. User interaction via RGB is generally thought to be counterintuitive, and transformations of RGB, such as Smith's HSV geometry [10] which is derived from centuries old artists' models [2], are more popular. More recent color theories, based on psychophysical and physiological models of early visual processing, suggest that more intuitive geometries may be possible.
