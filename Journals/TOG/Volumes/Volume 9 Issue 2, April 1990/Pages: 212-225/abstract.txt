In industrial design, the tool of choice for constructing surfaces that interpolate curves is the Boolean sum surface technique. However, if curves do not lie on constant parameter lines, reparametrizations will be needed, and this may introduce derivative discontinuities. A new technique which shows promise in overcoming this problem is described here. The method is based on describing the interpolation problem directly as a system of linear equations rather than as a curve-blending problem. The resulting system of equations is usually underdetermined and can be solved using numerical linear algebra methods without the a priori determination of certain parameters. The “free” parameters can be used to control the shape of the resulting surface. Two examples of the procedure are given.
