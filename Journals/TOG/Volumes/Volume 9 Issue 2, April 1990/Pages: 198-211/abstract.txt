We present a Bézier representation of &tgr;-splines, curvature and torsion-continuous quintics, which were introduced in CAGD by Hagen in 1985 [32]. Explicit formulas are given for the conversion from Bézier representation to &tgr;-spline representation, and vice versa. Thus, by embedding the Bézier representation in a &Bgr;-spline representation of curvature and torsion-continuous quintic spline curves, given in [20], a &Bgr;-spline-Bézier representation of &tgr;-splines results.Second, positivity conditions for the design parameters of the Bézier representation and certain ranges of tension values are derived, which ensure properties like the convex hull and the variation-diminishing property of the &Bgr;-spline-Bézier representation.
