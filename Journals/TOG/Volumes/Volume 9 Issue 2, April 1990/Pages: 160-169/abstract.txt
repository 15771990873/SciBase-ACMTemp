A new interpolatory subdivision scheme for surface design is presented. The new scheme is designed for a general triangulation of control points and has a tension parameter that provides design flexibility. The resulting limit surface isC1for a specified range of the tension parameter, with a few exceptions. Application of the butterfly scheme and the role of the tension parameter are demonstrated by several examples.
