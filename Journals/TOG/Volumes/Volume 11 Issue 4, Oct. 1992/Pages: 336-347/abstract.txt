Luminance contrast is the basis of text legibility, and maintaining luminance contrast is essential for any color selection algorithm. In principle, it can be calculated precisely on a sufficiently well-calibrated display surface, but calibration is very expensive. Consequently, most current systems deal with contrast using heuristics. However, the usual CRT setup puts the display surface into a state that is relatively predictable. Luminance values can be estimated based on this state, and these luminance values have been used to calculate contrast using the Michelson definition. This paper proposes a method for determining the contrast of colored areas displayed on a CRT. It uses a contrast metric that is in wide use in visual psychophysics and shows that the metric can be approximated reasonably without display measurement, as long as it is possible to assume that the CRT has been adjusted according to usual CRT setup standards.
