In this paper we study the relationship betweenmanifold solids(r-sets whose boundaries are two-dimensional closed manifolds) andr-sets. We begin by showing that an r-set may be viewed as the limit of a certain sequence of manifold solids, where distance is measured using the Hausdorff metric. This permits us to introduce a minimal set of generalized Euler operators, sufficient for the construction and manipulation of r-sets. The completeness result for ordinary Euler operators carries over immediately to the generalized Euler operators on the r-sets and the modification of the usual boundary data structures, corresponding to our extension to nonmanifold r-sets, is straightforward. We in fact describe a modification of a well-known boundary data structure in order to illustrate how the extension can be used in typical solid modeling algorithms, and describe an implementation.The results described above largely eliminate what has been called an inherent mismatch between the modeling spaces defined by manifold solids and by r-sets. We view the r-sets as a more appropriate choice for a modeling space: in particular, the r-sets provide closure with respect to regularized set operations and a complete set of generalized Euler operators for the manipulation of boundary representations, for graphics and other purposes. It remains to formulate and prove a theorem on the soundness of the generalized Euler operators.
