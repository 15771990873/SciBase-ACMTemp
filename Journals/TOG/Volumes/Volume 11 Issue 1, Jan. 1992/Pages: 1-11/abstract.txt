We derive a simple output-sensitive algorithm for hidden surface
removal in a collection ofntriangles in space for which a (partial) depth order is known. Ifkis the combinatorial complexity of
the outputvisibility map, the method
runs in timeOnklogn. The method is extended to work for other classes of
objects as well, sometimes with even improved time bounds. For example,
we obtain an algorithm that performs hidden surface removal forn(nonintersecting) balls in timeOn3/2logn+k.
