This paper presents an efficient algorithm called Hermite interpolation, for constructing low-degree algebraic surfaces, which contain, withC1or tangent plane continuity, any given collection of points and algebraic space curves having derivative information. Positional as well as derivative constraints on an implicitly defined algebraic surface are translated into a homogeneous linear system, where the unknowns are the coefficients of the polynomial defining the algebraic surface. Computaional details of the Hermite interpolation algorithm are presented along with several illustrative applications of the interpolation technique to construction of joining or blending surfaces for solid models as well as fleshing surfaces for curved wire frame models. A heuristic approach to interactive shape control of implicit algebraic surfaces is also given, and open problems in algebraic surface design are discussed.
