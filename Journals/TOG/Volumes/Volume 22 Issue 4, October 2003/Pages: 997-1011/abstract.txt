Progressive point set surfaces (PPSS) are a multilevel point-based surface representation. They combine the usability of multilevel scalar displacement maps (e.g., compression, filtering, geometric modeling) with the generality of point-based surface representations (i.e., no fixed homology group or continuity class). The multiscale nature of PPSS fosters the idea ofpoint-based modeling.The basic building block for the construction of PPSS is a projection operator, which maps points in the proximity of the shape onto local polynomial surface approximations. The projection operator allows the computing of displacements from smoother to more detailed levels. Based on the properties of the projection operator we derive an algorithm to construct a base point set. Starting from this base point set, a refinement rule using the projection operator constructs a PPSS from any given manifold surface.
