We propose that the generalization of signal and image processing to surfaces entails filtering the normals of the surface, rather than filtering the positions of points on a mesh. Using a variational strategy, penalty functions on the surface geometry can be formulated as penalty functions on the surface normals, which are computed using geometry-based shape metrics and minimized using fourth-order gradient descent partial differential equations (PDEs). In this paper, we introduce a two-step approach to implementing geometric processing tools for surfaces: (i) operating on the normal map of a surface, and (ii) manipulating the surface to fit the processed normals. Iterating this two-step process, we efficiently can implement geometric fourth-order flows by solving a set of coupled second-order PDEs. The computational approach uses level set surface models; therefore, the processing does not depend on any underlying parameterization. This paper will demonstrate that the proposed strategy provides for a wide range of surface processing operations, including edge-preserving smoothing and high-boost filtering. Furthermore, the generality of the implementation makes it appropriate for very complex surface models, for example, those constructed directly from measured data.
