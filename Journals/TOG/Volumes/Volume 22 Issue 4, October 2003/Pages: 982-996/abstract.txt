We focus on the lossy compression of manifold triangle meshes. Our SwingWrapper approach partitions the surface of an original meshMinto simply connected regions, calledtriangloids. From these, we generate a new meshM′. Each triangle ofM′is an approximation of a triangloid ofM. By construction, the connectivity ofM′is fairly regular and can be compressed to less than a bit per triangle using EdgeBreaker or one of the other recently developed schemes. The locations of the vertices ofM′are compactly encoded with our new prediction technique, which uses a single correction parameter per vertex. SwingWrapper strives to reach a user-defined output file size rather than to guarantee a given error bound. For a variety of popular models, a rate of 0.4 bits/triangle yields anL2distortion of about 0.01&percnt; of the bounding box diagonal. The proposed solution may also be used to encode crude meshes for adaptive transmission or for controlling subdivision surfaces.
