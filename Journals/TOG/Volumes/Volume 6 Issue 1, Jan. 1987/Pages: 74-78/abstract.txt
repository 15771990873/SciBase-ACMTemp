Description: The incrementor is a visually compact, flexible, and consistent mechanism for modifying the variables presented to the user. A locator (i.e., mouse) with two buttons is the required input device. The names of the variables appear in the center of one or two pairs of arrows, and the value of the variable appears just below the right arrow and to the left of the up arrow (Figures 1 and 2).
