The large size of many volume data sets often prevents visualization algorithms from providing interactive rendering. The use of hierarchical data structures can ameliorate this problem by storing summary information to prevent useless exploration of regions of little or nocurrentinterest within the volume. This paper discusses research into the use of theoctreehierarchical data structure when the regions of current interest can vary during the application, and are not knowna priori. Octrees are well suited to the six-sided cell structure of many volumes.A new space-efficient design is introduced for octree representations of volumes whose resolutions are not conveniently a power of two; octrees following this design are calledbranch-on-need octrees(BONOs). Also, a caching method is described that essentially passes information between octree neighbors whose visitation times may be quite different, then discards it when its useful life is over.Using the application of octrees to isosurface generation as a focus, space and time comparisons for octree-based versus more traditional “marching” methods are presented.
