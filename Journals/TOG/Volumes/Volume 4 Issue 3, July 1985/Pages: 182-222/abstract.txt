An adaptation of the quadtree data structure that represents polygonal maps (i.e., collections of polygons, possibly containing holes) is described ina manner that is also useful for the manipulation of arbitrary collections of straight line segments. The gol is to store these maps without the loss of information that results from digitization, and to obtain a worst-case execution time that is not overly sensitive to the positioning of the map. A regular decomposition variant of the region quadtree is used to organize the vertices and edges of the maps. A number of related data organizations are proposed in an iterative manner until a method is obtained that meets the stated goals. The result is termed a PM (polygonal map) quadtree and is based on a regular decomposition point space  quadtree (PR quadtree) that stores additional information about the edges at its terminal nodes. Algorithms are given for inserting and deleting line segments from a PM quadtree. Use of the PM quadtree to perform point location, dynamic line insertion, and map overlay is discussed. The PM quadtree is compared conceptually to the K-structure and the layered dag with respect to typical cartographic data. An empirical comparison of the PM quadtree with other quadtree-based representations for polygonal maps is also provided.
