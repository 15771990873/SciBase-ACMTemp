Stable and efficient algorithms for degree-raising of curves (or surfaces) represented as arbitrary B-splines are presented as a application of the solution to the theoretical problem of rewriting a curve written as a linear combination ofmth order B-splines as a linear combination of (m+ 1)st order B-splines with a minimal number of knot insertions. This approach can be used to introduce additional degrees of freedom to a curve (or surface), a problem which naturally arises in certain circumstances in constructing mathematical models for computer-aided geometric design.
