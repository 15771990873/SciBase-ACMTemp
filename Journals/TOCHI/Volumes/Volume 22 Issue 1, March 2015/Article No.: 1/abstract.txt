Implementation of large Health Information Technology (HIT) systems is critical to healthcare organizations and has seen heavy investment. However, research has not fully explored the adaptation of HIT systems, particularly the tensions between individual flexibility and organizational needs in the adaptation process. This study analyzes how Emergency Department (ED) clinicians adapted to a new hospital-wide Electronic Medical Records (EMR) system. We present four adaptation cases revealing two interrelated types of adaptations—technical and organizational—as responses to the new system in use. First, individual clinicians respond to the immediate alteration in workflows caused by the EMR, while the organizational adaptations later mitigate the changes in healthcare quality control resulting from the clinicians’ initial adaptation. Our analysis reflects the critical nature and value of both adaptation types, with an emphasis on the triggers and process of organizational adaptation, for the successful implementation of a socio-technical-political system in a healthcare organization.
