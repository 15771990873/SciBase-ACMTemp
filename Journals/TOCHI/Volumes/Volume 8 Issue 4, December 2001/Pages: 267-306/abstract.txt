Linear equality and inequality constraints arise naturally in specifying many aspects of user interfaces, such as requiring that one window be to the left of another, requiring that a pane occupy the leftmost third of a window, or preferring that an object be contained within a rectangle if possible. Previous constraint solvers designed for user interface applications cannot handle simultaneous linear equations and inequalities efficiently. This is a major limitation, as such systems of constraints arise often in natural declarative specifications. We describe Cassowary---an incremental algorithm based on the dual simplex method, which can solve such systems of constraints efficiently. We have implemented the algorithm as part of a constraint-solving toolkit. We discuss the implementation of the toolkit, its application programming interface, and its performance.
