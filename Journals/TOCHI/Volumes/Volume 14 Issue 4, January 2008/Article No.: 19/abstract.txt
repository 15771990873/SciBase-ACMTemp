We investigate the usability of constraint-based alignment and distribution placement tools in diagram editors. Currently one-way constraints are used to provide alignment and distribution tools in many commercial editors. We believe the limitations of these constraints lead to serious usability issues, and thus suggest that such tools be implemented using multi-way constraints. We have conducted two usability studies, the first studies we are aware of that examine the relative usefulness of interactive graphical tools based on one-way and multi-way constraints. They provide strong evidence that multi-way constraint-based alignment and distribution tools are more usable than one-way constraint-based alignment and distribution tools.
