An almost explosive growth of complexity puts pressure on people in their everyday doings. Digital artifacts and systems are at the core of this development. How should we handle complexity aspects when designing new interactive devices and systems&quest; In this article we begin an analysis ofinteraction complexity. We portray different views of complexity; we explore not only negative aspects of complexity, but also positive, making a case for the existence ofbenigncomplexity. We argue that complex interaction is not necessarily bad, but designers need a deeper understanding of interaction complexity and need to treat it in a more intentional and thoughtful way. We examine interaction complexity as it relates to different loci of complexity:internal,external, andmediatedcomplexity. Our purpose with these analytical exercises is to pave the way for design that is informed by a more focused and precise understanding of interaction complexity.
