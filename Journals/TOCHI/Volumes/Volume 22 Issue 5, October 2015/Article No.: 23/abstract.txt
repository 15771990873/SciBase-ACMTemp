Identity technologies constitute one of the fastest growing areas for research and development, driven by both commercial and administrative imperatives. Crucially, they constitute the means by which we include or exclude individuals and groups in terms of access to goods, services or information -- yet few developments in this space embrace an inclusive or value sensitive design philosophy. We describe a rigorous exercise in which we source scenarios that capture new research in the identity space and use these as probes in an inclusive design process. Workshops were held with six marginalized community groups: young people, older adults, refugees, black minority ethnic (BME) women, people with disabilities, and mental health service users. Our findings echo Herzberg's two-factor theory in which we are able to identify a set of relatively common values around sources of potential dissatisfaction (hygiene factors) as well as a set of motivators that are differentially valued across communities.
