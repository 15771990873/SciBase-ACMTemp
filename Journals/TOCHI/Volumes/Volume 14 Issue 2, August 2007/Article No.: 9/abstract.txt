The technology acceptance model (TAM) is very widely used for studying technology acceptance. The model states that an individual's behavioral intention (BI) to use an information system is determined by his perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU) of it. While many studies have applied the TAM, none has examined the model's behavior over its entire value range. We conducted two surveys to examine the values of BI over the two-dimensional boundary space formed by PU and PEOU. Contrary to current understanding, we find that the effects of PU and PEOU vary over the boundary space.
