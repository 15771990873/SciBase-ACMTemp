3D User Interface (3DUI) design and development requires practitioners (designers and developers) to represent their ideas in representations designed for machine execution rather than natural representations, hampering development of effective 3DUIs. As such, Concept-Oriented Design (COD) was created as a theory of software development for both natural and executable design and development. Instantiated in the toolkit Chasm, Chasm is a natural, tiered, executable User Interface Description Language (UIDL) for 3DUIs resulting in improved understandability, as well as reduced complexity and reuse. Chasm's utility is shown through evaluations by domain experts, case studies of long-term use, and ananalysis of spaces.
