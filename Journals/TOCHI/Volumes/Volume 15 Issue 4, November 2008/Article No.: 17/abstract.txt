This article provides a methodological perspective on the notion of the aesthetics of interaction in ambient computing systems. Aesthetics of interaction is challenged by the design proposal for the soft qualities of interaction, which is used as a tool to complement existing design methodologies. The perspective presented is based on work conducted in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at Siena Hospital in Italy, as a part of the EU PalCom project. The early outcomes provide a heuristic account which questions the design process by fostering the novel complexity of ambient technologies in delicate and fragile settings.
