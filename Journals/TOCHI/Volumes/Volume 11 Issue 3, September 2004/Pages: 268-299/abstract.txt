ISIS (Intelligent Speech for Information Systems) is a trilingual spoken dialog system (SDS) for the stocks domain. It handles two dialects of Chinese (Cantonese and Putonghua) as well as English---the predominant languages in our region. The system supports spoken language queries regarding stock market information and simulated personal portfolios. The conversational interface is augmented with a screen display that can capture mouse-clicks as well as textual input by typing or stylus-writing. Real-time information is retrieved directly from a dedicated Reuters satellite feed. ISIS provides a system test-bed for our work in multilingual speech recognition and generation, speaker authentication, language understanding and dialog modeling. This article reports on our new explorations within the context of ISIS, including: (i) adaptivity to knowledge scope expansion; (ii) asynchronous human-computer interaction by task delegation to software agents; (iii) multi-threaded online interaction and offline delegation dialogs with interruptions for task switching.
