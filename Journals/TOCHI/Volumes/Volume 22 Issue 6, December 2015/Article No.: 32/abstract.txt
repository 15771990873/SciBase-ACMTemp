Managing the privacy of online information can be a complex task often involving the configuration of a variety of settings. For example, Facebook users determine which audiences have access to their profile information and posts, how friends can interact with them through tagging, and how others can search for themâ€”and many more privacy tasks. In most cases, the default privacy settings are permissive and appear to be designed to promote information sharing rather than privacy. Managing privacy online can be complex and often users do not change defaults or use granular privacy settings. In this article, we investigate whether default privacy settings on social network sites could be more customized to the preferences of users. We survey users' privacy attitudes and sharing preferences for common SNS profile items. From these data, we explore using audience characterizations of profile items to quantify fit scores that indicate how well default privacy settings represent user privacy preferences. We then explore the fit of various schemes, including examining whether privacy attitude segmentation can be used to improve default settings. Our results suggest that using audience characterizations from community data to create default privacy settings can better match users' desired privacy settings.
