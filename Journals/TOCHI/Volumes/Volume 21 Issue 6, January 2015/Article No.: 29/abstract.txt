Physiological data in its different dimensions—bioelectrical, biomechanical, biochemical, or biophysical—and collected through existing sensors or specialized biomedical devices, image capture, or other sources is pushing the boundaries of physiological computing for human-computer interaction (HCI). Although physiological computing shows the potential to enhance the way in which people interact with digital content, systems remain challenging to design and build. The aim of this special issue is to present outstanding work related to use of physiological data in HCI, setting additional bases for next-generation computer interfaces and interaction experiences. Topics covered in this issue include methods and methodologies, human factors, the use of devices, and applications for supporting the development of emerging interfaces.
