This article presents results from a study of an automated capture and access system, eClass, which was designed to capture the materials presented in college lectures for later review by students. In this article, we highlight the lessons learned from our three-year study focusing on the effect of capture and access on grades, attendance, and use of the captured notes and media. We then present suggestions for building future systems discussing improvements from our system in the capture, integration, and access of college lectures.
