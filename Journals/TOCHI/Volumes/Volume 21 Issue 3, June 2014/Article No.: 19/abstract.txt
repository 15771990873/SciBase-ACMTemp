In this article, we describe the design process and principles used in the development of Estrellita, a tool to support parents of preterm infants to track health data. We tested Estrellita in the homes of seven families for 4 months while following seven additional families without Estrellita. The feedback from this trial, including in-depth interviews, surveys, and log analyses, sheds light on how parents can use a mobile data collection tool to enhance their problem-solving processes about their own health and that of their infants, as well as to share with others who support them in this care. In addition to presenting the design of a recording technology for preterm infants and its use in a real-life setting, the results of this research provide a deep understanding of how technology can and should be used to support home care of at-risk patients, in which data capture may be essential.
