We present a careful evaluation of the sensory characteristics of the CyberGlove model CG1801 whole-hand input device. In particular, we conducted an experimental study that investigated the level of sensitivity of the sensors, their performance in recognizing angles, and factors that affected accuracy of recognition of flexion measurements. Among our results, we show that hand size differences among the subjects of the study did not have a statistical effect on the accuracy of the device. We also analyzed the effect of different software calibration approaches on accuracy of the sensors.
