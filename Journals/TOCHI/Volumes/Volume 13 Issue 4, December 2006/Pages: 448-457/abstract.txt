Handheld displays leave little space for the visualization and navigation of spatial layouts representing rich information spaces. The most common navigation method for handheld displays isstatic peephole navigation: The peephole is static and we move the spatial layout behind it (scrolling). A more natural method isdynamicpeephole navigation: here, the spatial layout is static and we move the peephole across it. In the experiment reported here, we compared dynamic and static peephole navigation in otherwise similar conditions. Subjects viewed a spatial layout containing two lines on a static display screen. Only a part of the screen---the peephole---was visible. Subjects had to discriminate line length by either moving a dynamic peephole across a static layout of the lines or by moving a dynamic layout behind a static peephole. In both conditions, they used mouse-cursor control to move either the peephole or the lines.Results show significant differences in discrimination performance between conditions when lines are larger than the size of the peephole. Discrimination thresholds for static peephole navigation were 50--75&percnt; higher than for dynamic peephole navigation. Furthermore, static peephole navigation took 24&percnt; more time than dynamic peephole navigation.
