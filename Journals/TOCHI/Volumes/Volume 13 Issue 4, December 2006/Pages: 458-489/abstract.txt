Recent improvements in text entry error rate measurement have enabled the running of text entry experiments in which subjects are free to correct errors (or not) as they transcribe a presented string. In these “unconstrained” experiments, it is no longer necessary to force subjects to unnaturally maintain synchronicity with presented text for the sake of performing overall error rate calculations. However, the calculation ofcharacter-levelerror rates, which can be trivial in artificially constrained evaluations, is far more complicated in unconstrained text entry evaluations because it is difficult to infer a subject's intention at every character. For this reason, prior character-level error analyses for unconstrained experiments have only compared presented and transcribed strings, not input streams. But input streams are rich sources of character-level error information, since they contain all of the text entered (and erased) by a subject. The current work presents an algorithm for the automated analysis of character-level errors in input streams for unconstrained text entry evaluations. It also presents new character-level metrics that can aid method designers in refining text entry methods. To exercise these metrics, we perform two analyses on data from an actual text entry experiment. One analysis, available from the prior work, uses only presented and transcribed strings. The other analysis uses input streams, as described in the current work. The results confirm that input stream error analysis yields richer information for the same empirical data. To facilitate the use of these new analyses, we offer pseudocode and downloadable software for performing unconstrained text entry experiments and analyzing data.
