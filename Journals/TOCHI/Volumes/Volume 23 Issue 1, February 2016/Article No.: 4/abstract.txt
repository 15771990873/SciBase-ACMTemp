In this article, we evaluateb-Reactable, a digital music instrument that combines implicit physiology-based interaction through EEG and ECG, and explicit gestural interaction for sound generation and control. This multimodality is embodied in tangible objects namedphysiopucks,which are driven by biosignals. We hypothesize that multimodality increases usersâ€™ motivation in a musical task, compared to the use of a gesture-only tabletop system (the Reactable). We compared motivational aspects in dyads collaborating in three experimental groups (N &equals; 56): the Physio group (one physiology- and one gesture-based user), the Sham group (one prerecorded physiology- and one gesture-based user), and the Control group (two gesture users). Between-group comparisons showed that motivation dimensions of Confidence and Satisfaction were higher inb-Reactablethan in the gesture-only tangible interface, and that fake physiology-based feedback significantly reduced these effects. Our study also shows the potential of combined implicit and explicit interaction modes in multiuser HCI scenarios.
