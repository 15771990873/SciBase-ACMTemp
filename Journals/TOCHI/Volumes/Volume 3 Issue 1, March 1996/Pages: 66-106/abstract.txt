This article presents an overview of GroupKit, a groupware toolkit that lets developers build applications for synchronous and distributed computer-based conferencing. GroupKit was constructed from our belief that programming groupware should be only slightly harder than building functionally similar single-user systems. We have been able to significantly reduce the implementation complexity of groupware through the key features that comprise GroupKit. Aruntime infrastructureautomatically manages the creation, interconnection, and communications of the distributed processes that comprise conference sessions. A set ofgroupware programming abstractionsallows developers to control the behavior of distributed processes, to take action on state  changes, and to share relevant data.Groupware widgetslet interface features of value to conference participants to be easily added to groupware applications.Session managers—interfaces that let people create and manage their meetings—are decoupled from groupware applications and are built by developers to accommodate the group's working style. Example GroupKit applications in a variety of domains have been implemented with only modest effort.
