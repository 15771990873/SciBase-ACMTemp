Recent years have seen an overwhelming interest in how people work together as a group. Both the nature of collaboration and research into how people collaborate is complex and multifaceted, with different research agendas, types of studies, and variations in the behavioral data collected. A better understanding of collaboration is needed in order to be able to make contributions to the design of systems to support collaboration and collaborative tasks. In this article, we combine relevant literature, past research, and a small-scale empirical study of two people individually and collaboratively constructing jigsaws. The objective is to make progress towards the goal of generating extensions to an existing task modeling approach, Task Knowledge Structures. The research described has enabled us to generate requirements for approaches to modeling collaborative tasks and also a set of requirements to be taken into account in the design of a computer-based collaborative virtual jigsaw.
