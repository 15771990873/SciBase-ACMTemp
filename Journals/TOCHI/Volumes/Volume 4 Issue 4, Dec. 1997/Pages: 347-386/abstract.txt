Conventional interface builders provide little support for interactive development of interfaces with application-specific graphics. Some Programming by Demonstration (PBD) systems do provide such support, but none provide full support for demonstrating interfaces, such as those in games, in which the graphics are animated. This article proposes a number of techniques for creating animated interfaces, all of which have been included in an exploratory system,Pavlov. Many of the techniques are based on the addition of timing controls to a form of PBD calledstimulus-response demonstration. Others are based on an adaptation of a traditional animation time-line that integrates end-user interaction with animation. The article also evaluatesPavlovwith (1) a comparison to other PBD systems in terms of the behaviors that can be specified interactively and (2) a report on an informal user study comparing development inPavlovto development in a conventional interface builder.
