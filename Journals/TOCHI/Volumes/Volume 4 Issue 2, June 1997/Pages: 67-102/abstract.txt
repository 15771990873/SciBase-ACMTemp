This article investigates working-memory (WM) failure in phone-based interaction (PBI). We used a computational model of phone-based interaction (PBI USER) to generate predictions about the impact of three factors on WM failure:PBI features (i.e. menu structure), individual differences (i.e., WM capacity), and task characteristics (i.e., number of tasks). Our computational model stipulates that both the storageandthe processing of information contribute to WM failure. In practical terms the model and the empirical results indicate that, contrary to guidelines for the design of phone-based interfaces, deep menu hierarchies (no more than three options per menu) do not reduce WM error rates in PBI. At a more theoretical level, the study shows that the use of a  computational model in HCI research provides a systematic approach for explaining complex empirical results.
