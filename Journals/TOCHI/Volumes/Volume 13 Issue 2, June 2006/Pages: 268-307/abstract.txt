In a graphical user interface, physical layout and abstract structure are two important aspects of a graph. This article proposes a new graph grammar formalism which integrates both the spatial and structural specification mechanisms in a single framework. This formalism is equipped with a parser that performs in polynomial time with an improved parsing complexity over its nonspatial predecessor, that is, the Reserved Graph Grammar. With the extended expressive power, the formalism is suitable for many user interface applications. The article presents its application in adaptive Web design and presentation.
