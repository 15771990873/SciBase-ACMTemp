We present a software system, called Tunserver, which recognizes a musical tune whistled by the user, finds it in a database, and returns its name, composer, and other information. Such a service is useful for track retrieval at radio stations, music stores, etc., and is also a step toward the long-term goal of communicating with a computer much like one would with a human being. Tuneserver is implemented as a public Java-based WWW service with a database of approximately 10,000 motifs. Tune recognition is based on a highly error-resistant encoding, proposed by Parsons, that uses only the direction of the melody, ignoring the size of intervals as well as rhythm. We present the design and implementation of the tune recognition core, outline the design of the Web service, and describe the results obtained in an empirical evaluation of the new interface, including the derivation of suitable system parameters, resulting performance figures, and an error analysis.
