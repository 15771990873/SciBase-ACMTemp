A scheme to answer best-match queries from a file containing a collection of objects is described. A best-match query is to find the objects in the file that are closest (according to some (dis)similarity measure) to a given target.Previous work [5, 331] suggests that one can reduce the number of comparisons required to achieve the desired results using the triangle inequality, starting with a data structure for the file that reflects some precomputed intrafile distances. We generalize the technique to allow the optimum use of any given set of precomputed intrafile distances. Some empirical results are presented which illustrate the effectiveness of our scheme, and its performance relative to previous algorithms.
