The design of very small databases for smart cards and for portable embedded systems is deeply constrained by the peculiar features of the physical medium. We propose a joint approach to the logical and physical database design phases and evaluate several data structures with respect to the performance, power consumption, and endurance parameters of read/program operations on the Flash-EEPROM storage medium.
