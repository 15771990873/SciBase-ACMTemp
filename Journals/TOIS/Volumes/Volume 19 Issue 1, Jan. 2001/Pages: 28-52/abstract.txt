This paper presents a formal definition for HMBS (Hypermedia Model Based on Statecharts). HMBS uses the structure and execution semantics of statecharts to specify both the structural organization and the browsing semantics of hypermedia applications. Statecharts are an extension of finite-state machines and the model is thus a generalization of hypergraph-based hypertext models. Some of the most important features of HMBS are its ability to model hierarchy and synchronization of information; provision of mechanisms for specifying access structures, navigational contexts, access control, multiple tailored versions,and hierarchical views. Analysis of the underlying statechart machine allows verification of page reachability, valid paths, and other properties, thus providing mechanisms to support authors in the development of structured applications.
