EmbeddedButtons is a library of routines and a runtime kernel that support the integration of buttons into document media, including text and graphics. Existing document editors can be modified to participate in this open architecture with the addition of a few simple routines. Unlike many button systems that insert special button objects into document media, this system supports turning existing document objectsinto buttons. As a consequence, buttons inherit all of the attributes of normal document objects, and the appearance of buttons can be edited using operations already familiar to users. Facilities are provided for linking buttons to application windows so that documents can serve as application control panels. Hence, user interface designers can lay out  control panels using familiar document editors rather than special-purpose tools. Three classes of buttons have been implemented, including buttons that pop up a menu and buttons that store and display the value of a variable. New button classes, editors, and applications can be added at run time. Two editors, one for text and one for graphics, currently participate in the architecture.
