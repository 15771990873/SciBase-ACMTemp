Local area networksare becoming widely used as the database communication framework for sophisticated information systems. Databases can be distributed among stations on a network to achieve the advantages of performance, reliability, availability, and modularity. Efficient distributed query optimization algorithms are presented here for two types of local area networks:address ring networksandbroadcast networks. Optimal algorithms are designed forsimple queries. Optimization principles from these algorithms guide the development of effective heuristic algorithms for general queries on both types of networks. Several examples illustrate distributed query processing on local area networks.
