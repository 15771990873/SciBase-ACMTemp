The main purpose of a digital library is to facilitate users easy 
access to enormous amount of globally networked information. Typically, this information includes preexisting public library catalog data, digitized document collections, and other databases. In this article, we describe the distributed query system of a digital library prototype system known as HARP. In the HARP project, we have designed and implemented a distributed query processor and its query front-end to support integrated queries to preexisting public library catalogs and structured databases. This article describes our experiences in the design of an extended Sequel (SQL) query language known as HarpSQL. It also presents the design and implementation of the distributed query system. Our experience in  distributed query processor and user interface design and development will be highlighted. We believe that our prototyping effort will provide useful lessons to the development of a complete digital library infrastructure.
