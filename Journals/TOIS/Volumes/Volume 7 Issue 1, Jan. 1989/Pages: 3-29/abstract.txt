We present a formal definition of the Trellis model of hypertext and describe an authoring and browsing prototype called &agr;Trellis that is based on the model. The Trellis model not only represents the relationships that tie individual pieces of information together into a document (i.e., the adjacencies), but specifies the browsing semantics to be associated with the hypertext as well (i.e., the manner in which the information is to be visited and presented). The model is based on Petri nets, and is a generalization of existing directed graph-based forms of hypertext. The Petri net basis permits more powerful specification of what is to be displayed when a hypertext is browsed and permits application of previously developed Petri net analysis techniques to verify properties of the hypertext. A number of useful hypertext constructs, easily described in the Trellis model, are presented. These include the synchronization of simultaneous traversals of separate paths through a hypertext, the incorporation of access controls into a hypertext (i.e., specifying nodes that can be proven to be accessible only to certain classes of browsers), and construction of multiple specialized (tailored) versions from a single hypertext.
