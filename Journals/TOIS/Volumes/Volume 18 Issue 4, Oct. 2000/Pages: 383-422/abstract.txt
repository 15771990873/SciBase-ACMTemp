This paper raises the question, “What is an effective representation framework for organizational process design?” By combining our knowledge of existing process models with data from a field study, the paper develops criteria for an effective process representation. Using these criteria and the case study, the paper integrates the process redesign and information system literatures to develop a representation framework that captures a process' social context. The paper argues that this social context framework, which represents people's motivations, social relationships, and social constraints, gives redesigners a richer sense of the process and allows process redesigners to simultaneously change social and logistic systems. The paper demonstrates the framework and some of its benefits and limitations.
