This paper describes the basic data model of an object-oriented database and the basic architecture of the system implementing it. In particular, a secondary storage segmentation scheme and a transaction-processing scheme are discussed. The segmentation scheme allows for arbitrary clustering of objects, including duplicates. The transaction scheme allows for many different sharing protocols ranging from those that enforce serializability to those that are nonserializable and require communication with the server only on demand. The interaction of these two features is described such that segment-level transfer and object-level locking is achieved.
