Two tools that support cooperation are described: one for the construction of consistent and principled human-computer interfaces and the other for the construction of AI knowledge bases. These tools provide a central repository for design knowledge that otherwise would not be easily shared among users. The AI knowledge representation technology upon which the tools are founded is first described. A knowledge-based approach to interface construction is discussed, and how that approach applies to detecting design conflicts and inconsistencies stemming from two different kinds of team communication failure is illustrated. Next, a knowledge acquisition aid that is utilized within the interface construction paradigm and that also illustrates the same approach to supporting cooperative work is described. Finally, four sources of difficulty in team design efforts, which this approach seeks to address, are reviewed.
