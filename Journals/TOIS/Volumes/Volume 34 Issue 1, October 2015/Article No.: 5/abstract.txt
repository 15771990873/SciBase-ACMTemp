Multidocument summarization addresses the selection of a compact subset of highly informative sentences, i.e., the summary, from a collection of textual documents. To perform sentence selection, two parallel strategies have been proposed: (a) apply general-purpose techniques relying on data mining or information retrieval techniques, and/or (b) perform advanced linguistic analysis relying on semantics-based models (e.g., ontologies) to capture the actual sentence meaning. Since there is an increasing need for processing documents written in different languages, the attention of the research community has recently focused on summarizers based on strategy (a).This article presents a novel multilingual summarizer, namely MWI-Sum (Multilingual Weighted Itemset-based Summarizer), that exploits an itemset-based model to summarize collections of documents ranging over the same topic. Unlike previous approaches, it extracts frequent weighted itemsets tailored to the analyzed collection and uses them to drive the sentence selection process. Weighted itemsets represent correlations among multiple highly relevant terms that are neglected by previous approaches. The proposed approach makes minimal use of language-dependent analyses. Thus, it is easily applicable to document collections written in different languages.Experiments performed on benchmark and real-life collections, English-written and not, demonstrate that the proposed approach performs better than state-of-the-art multilingual document summarizers.
