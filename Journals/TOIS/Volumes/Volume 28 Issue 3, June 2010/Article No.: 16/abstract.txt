This article presents two probabilistic models for answering ranking in the multilingual question-answering (QA) task, which finds exact answers to a natural language question written in different languages. Although some probabilistic methods have been utilized in traditional monolingual answer-ranking, limited prior research has been conducted for answer-ranking in multilingual question-answering with formal methods. This article first describes a probabilistic model that predicts the probabilities of correctness for individual answers in an independent way. It then proposes a novel probabilistic method to jointly predict the correctness of answers by considering both the correctness of individual answers as well as their correlations. As far as we know, this is the first probabilistic framework that proposes to model the correctness and correlation of answer candidates in multilingual question-answering and provide a novel approach to design a flexible and extensible system architecture for answer selection in multilingual QA. An extensive set of experiments were conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed probabilistic methods in English-to-Chinese and English-to-Japanese cross-lingual QA, as well as English, Chinese, and Japanese monolingual QA using TREC and NTCIR questions.
