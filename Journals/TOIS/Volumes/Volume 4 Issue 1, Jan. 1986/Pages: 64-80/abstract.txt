Thelogical routingof a message in a computer mail system involves the identification and location of the set of intended recipients for that message. This function is carried out by the naming and addressing mechanism of the mail system. An important property of that mechanism is that it should be able to identify and locate all the intended recipients of a message, so that, once submitted, a message will not become lost or stuck in the system. We first discussmessage addressing schemes, which are a framework for dealing with the naming and addressing problem. Message addressing schemes can also serve as a basis for the analysis of some of the properties of logical message routing within a system. We examine the conditions necessary for acompletemessage addressing scheme, that is, one that guarantees to deliver all possible messages.
