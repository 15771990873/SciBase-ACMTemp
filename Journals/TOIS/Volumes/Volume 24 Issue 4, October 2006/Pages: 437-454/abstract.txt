This research examines the feasibility of dynamic element retrieval in a structured environment. Structured documents and queries are represented in extended vector form, based on a modification of the basic vector space model suggested by Fox [1983]. A method for the dynamic retrieval of XML elements, which requires only a single indexing of the documents at the level of the basic indexing node, is presented. This method, which we refer to asflexible retrieval, produces a rank ordered list of retrieved elements that is equivalent to the result produced by the same retrieval against an all-element index of the collection. Flexible retrieval obviates the need for storing either an all-element index or multiple indices of the collection.
