Research on the nature of knowledge-based systems for bibliographic information retrieval is summarized. Knowledge-based search tactics are then considered in terms of their role in the functioning of a semantically based search system for bibliographic information retrieval, EP-X. This system uses such tactics to actively assist users in defining or refining their topics of interest. It does so by applying these tactics to a knowledge base describing topics in a particular domain and to a database describing the contents of individual documents in terms of these topics. This paper, then, focuses on the two central concepts behind EP-X: semantically based search and knowledge-based search tactics.
