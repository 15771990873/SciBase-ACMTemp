An imperative sentence processor that enables a user to manipulate text with connected speech and touch-graphics input is described. The processor includes capabilities to follow dialogue focus, execute a variety of imperative commands, and handle nested noun groups, pronouns, and other phenomena. A micromodel of the system, giving enough of the structure to enable the reader to observe internal mechanisms in considerable detail, is included. This processor is designed to be transportable to a number of other office automation domains such as calendar management, message-passing, and desk calculation. Various examples and statistics related to its behavior in the text manipulation application are given. The system has been implemented in PASCAL and can run on any machine that supports this language.
