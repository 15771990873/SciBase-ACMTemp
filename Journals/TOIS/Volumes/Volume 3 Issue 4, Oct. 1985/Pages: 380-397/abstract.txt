DITROFF/FFORTID, a collection of pre- and postprocessors for the UNIXDITROFF(Device Independent Typesetter RunOFF) is described.DITROFF/FFORTIDpermits formatting of text involving a mixture of languages written from left to right and from right to left, such as English and Hebrew. The programs are table driven or macro-generated to permit them to be used for any languages written from left to right and from right to left so long as fonts with the proper character sets can be mounted on a typesetting device supported byDITROFF. The preprocessors are set up to permit phonetic, unidirectional input of all of the alphabets needed using only the two alphabets (each case counts as an alphabet) available on the input device. These macro-generated preprocessors can be adjusted to the user's pronunciation, the language's rules about a letter's form, depending on its position in the word, and the language of the user's input keyboard. The postprocessor is set up to properly change direction of formatting when the text switches to a language written in a different direction. The collection of programs is also designed to allow use of any ofDITROFF's preprocessors, such asPIC,EQN,TBL, and the various device drivers.
