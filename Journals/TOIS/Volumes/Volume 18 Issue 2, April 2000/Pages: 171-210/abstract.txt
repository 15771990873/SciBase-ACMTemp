Large image databases have emerged in various applications in recent years. A prime requisite of these databases is the means by which their contents can be indexed and retrieved. A multilevel signature file called the Two Signature Multi-level Signature File (2SMLSF) is introduced as an efficient access structure for large image databases. The2SMLSFencodes image information into binary signatures and creates a tree structures can be efficiently searched to satisfy a user's query. Two types of signatures are generated. TypeIsignatures are used at all tree levels except the leaf level and are based only on the domain objects included in the image. TypeIIsignatures, on the other hand, are stored at the leaf level and are based on the included domain objects and their spatial relationships. The2SMLSFwas compared analytically to existing signature file techniques. The2SMLSFsignificantly reduces the storage requirements; the index structure can answer more queries; and the2SMLSFperformance significantly improves over current techniques. Both storage reduction and performance improvement increase with the number of objects per image and the number of images in the database. For an example large image database, a storage reduction of 78% may be archieved  while the performance improvement may reach 98%.
