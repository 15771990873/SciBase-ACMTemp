This paper is concerned with some of the issues arising in the development of a domain-independent English interface to IBM SQL-based program products. The TQA system falls into the class of multilayered natural language processing systems. As a result, there is a large number of potential points at which customization to a particular database can be done. Of these, we discuss procedures that affect the reader, the lexicon, the lowest level of grammar rules, the semantic interpreter, and the output formatter. Our tests lead us to believe that the approach we are taking will make it possible for database administrators to generate robust English interfaces to particular databases without help from linguistic experts.
