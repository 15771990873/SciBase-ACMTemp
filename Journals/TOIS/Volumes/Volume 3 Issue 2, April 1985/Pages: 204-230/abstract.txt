We discuss a recently launched, long-term project in natural language processing, the primary concern of which is that natural language applications be transportable among human languages. In particular, we seek to develop system tools and linguistic processing techniques that are themselves language-independent to the maximum extent practical. In this paper we discuss our project goals and outline our intended approach, address some cross-linguistic requirements, and then present some new linguistic data that we feel support our approach.
