This paper presents a discussion of the techniques developed and problems encountered during the design, implementation, and experimental use of a portable natural language processor. Datalog (for “database dialogue") is an experimental natural language query system, which was designed to achieve a maximum degree of portability and extendibility. Datalog uses a three-level architecture to provide both portability of syntax to new and extended tasks and portability of semantics to new database applications. The implementation of each of the three levels, the structures and conventions that control the interactions among them, and the way in which different aspects of the design contribute to portability are described. Finally, two specific, implemented examples are presented, showing how it was possible to transport or extend Datalog by changing only one “layer” of the system's knowledge and achieve correct processing of the extended input by the entire system.
