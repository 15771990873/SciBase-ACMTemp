In this paper methods and principles that help to analyze offices as systems of communicative action are explored. In communicative action, office agents create commitments through symbolic means. A SAMPO (Speech-Act-based office Modeling aPprOach), which studies office activities as a series of speech acts creating, maintaining, modifying, reporting, and terminating commitments, is presented. The main steps and methods in the office system specification are outlined and their application illustrated through a simple example. In the final section advantages and disadvantages in the SAMPO are noted and some research directions for the future are suggested.
