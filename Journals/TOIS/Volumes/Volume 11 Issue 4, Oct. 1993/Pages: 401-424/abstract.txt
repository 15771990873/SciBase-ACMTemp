Telephones are the most ubiquitous, best-networked, and simplest computer terminals available today. They have been used for voice mail but largely overlooked as a platform for asynchronous cooperative-work applications such as event calendars, issue discussions, and question-and-answer gathering. HyperVoice is a software toolkit for constructing such applications. Its building blocks are high-level presentation formats for collections of structured voice messages. The presentation formats can themselves be presented and manipulated, enabling significant customization of applications by phone. Results of two field trials suggest social-context factors that will influence the success or failure of phone-based cooperative work applications in particular settings.
