Although there has been important progress in models and packages for theoutputof graphics to computer screens, there has been little change in the way thatinputfrom the mouse, keyboard, and other input devices is handled. New graphics standards are still using a fifteen-year-old model even though it is widely accepted as inadequate, and most modern window managers simply return a stream of low-level, device-dependent input events. This paper presents a new model that handles input devices for highly interactive, direct manipulation, graphical user interfaces, which could be used in future toolkits, window managers, and graphics standards. This model encapsulates interactive behaviors into a few “Interactor” object types. Application  programs can then create instances of these Interactor objects which hide the details of the underlying window manager events. In addition, Interactors allow a clean separation between the input handling, the graphics, and the application programs. This model has been extensively used as part of the Garnet system and has proven to be convenient, efficient, and easy to learn.
