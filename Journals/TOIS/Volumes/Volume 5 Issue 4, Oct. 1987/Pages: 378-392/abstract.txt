A thesaurus can be a critical component of an office information system. Access to various sets of documents can be facilitated by thesauri and by the connections that are made among thesauri. In the projects described in this paper, the thesauri are stored and manipulated through a relational database management system. The system detects inheritance properties in a thesaurus and uses them to guide a human expert in decisions about how to augment the thesaurus. New strategies will extend our ability to augment existing thesauri.
