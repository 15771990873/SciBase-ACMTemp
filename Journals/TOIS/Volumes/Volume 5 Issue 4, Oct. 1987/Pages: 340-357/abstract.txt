The adoption of new computer communication systems into organizations requires behavioral change. Planning for successful adoption requires knowledge of individual organizational communication patterns and the relationship between those patterns and particular communication system solutions. This paper documents a sequence of studies of organizational communication. Needs for office communication systems were identified, as were social and psychological factors temporarily inhibiting their use. Strategies for assuring smooth adoption of such systems are highlighted.
