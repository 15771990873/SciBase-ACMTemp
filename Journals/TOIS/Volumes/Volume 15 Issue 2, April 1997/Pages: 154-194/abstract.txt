Efforts to place vast information resources at the fingertips of each individual in large user populations must be balanced by commensurate attention to information protection. For distributed systems with less-structured tasks, more-diversified information, and a heterogeneous user set, the computing system must administer enterprise-chosen access control policies. One kind of resource is a digital library that emulates massive collections of paper and other physical media for clerical, engineering, and cultural applications. This article considers the security requirements for such libraries and proposes an access control method that mimics organizational practice by combining a subject tree with ad hoc role granting that controls privileges for many operations independently, that  treats (all but one) privileged roles (e.g., auditor, security officer) like every other individual authorization, and that binds access control information to objects indirectly for scaling, flexibility, and reflexive protection. We sketch a realization and show that it will perform well, generalizes many deployed proposed access control policies, and permits individual data centers to implement other models economically and without disruption.
