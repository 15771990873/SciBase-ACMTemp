The Software Technology Program of MCC is investigating the early part of the design process, before requirements are established, for large-scale distributed systems. Face-to-face meetings are an important activity during this phase of a project since they provide a medium for direction, exploration, and consensus building. Project Nick is attempting to apply automated facilities to the process, conduct, and semantic capture of design meetings. Primary topics covered in this paper are meeting analysis, meeting augmentation, and a model of meeting progression that serves as the framework for our work.
