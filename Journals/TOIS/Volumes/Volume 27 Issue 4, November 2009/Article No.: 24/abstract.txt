Web recommender systems are Web applications capable of generating useful suggestions for visitors of Internet sites. However, in the case of large user communities and in presence of a high number of Web sites, these tasks are computationally onerous, even more if the client software runs on devices with limited resources. Moreover, the quality of the recommendations strictly depends on how the recommendation algorithm takes into account the currently used device. Some approaches proposed in the literature provide multidimensional recommendations considering, besides items and users, also the exploited device. However, these systems do not efficiently perform, since they assign to either the client or the server the arduous cost of computing recommendations. In this article, we argue that a fully distributed organization is a suitable solution to improve the efficiency of multidimensional recommender systems. In order to address these issues, we propose a novel distributed architecture, called MUADDIB, where each user's device is provided with adevice assistantthat autonomously retrieves information about the user's behavior. Moreover, a singleprofiler, associated with the user, periodically collects information coming from the different user's device assistants to construct a global user's profile. In order to generate recommendations, arecommenderprecomputes data provided by the profilers. This way, the site manager has only the task of suitably presenting the content of the site, while the computation of the recommendations is assigned to the other distributed components. Some experiments conducted on real data and using some well-known metrics show that the system works more effectively and efficiently than other device-based distributed recommenders.
