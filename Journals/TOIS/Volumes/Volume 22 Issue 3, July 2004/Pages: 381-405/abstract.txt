This paper presents an efficient method for mining both positive and negative association rules in databases. The method extends traditional associations to include association rules of formsA⇒ ¬B, ¬A⇒B, and ¬A⇒ ¬B, which indicate negative associations between itemsets. With a pruning strategy and an interestingness measure, our method scales to large databases. The method has been evaluated using both synthetic and real-world databases, and our experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency.
