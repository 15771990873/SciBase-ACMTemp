We introduce POINTY, an interactive system for constructing world-model-based programs for robots. POINTY combines an interactive programming environment with the teaching-by-guiding methodology that has been successful in industrial robotics. Owing to its ability to control robots in real time, and to interact with the user, POINTY provides a friendly and powerful programming environment for robot applications. In the past few years, POINTY has been in use at Stanford to write, test, and debug various robot programs.
