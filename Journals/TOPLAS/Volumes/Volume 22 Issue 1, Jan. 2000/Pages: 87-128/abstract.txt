Inmodular verificationthe specification of a module consists of two part. One part describes the guaranteed behavior of the module. The other part describes the assumed behavior of the system in which the module is interacting. This is called theassume-guaranteeparadigm. In this paper we consider assume-guarantee specifications in which the guarantee is specified by branching temporal formulas. We distinguish between two approaches. In the first approach, the assumption is specified  by branching temporal formulas too. In the second approach, the assumption is specified by linear temporal logic. We consider guarantees in∀CTL, and∀CTL*. We   develop two fundamental techniques: building maximal models for∀CTL and∀
