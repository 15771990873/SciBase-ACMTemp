In this paper we outline an approach to describing and analyzing designs for distributed software systems. A descriptive notation is introduced, and analysis techniques applicable to designs expressed in that notation are presented. The usefulness of the approach is illustrated by applying it to a realistic distributed software-system design problem involving mutual exclusion in a computer network.
