A new approach to information flow in sequential and parallel programs is presented. Flow proof rules that capture the information flow semantics of a variety of statements are given and used to construct program flow proofs. The method is illustrated by examples. The applications of flow proofs to certifying information flow policies and to solving the confinement problem are considered. It is also shown that flow rules and correctness rules can be combined to form an even more powerful proof system.
