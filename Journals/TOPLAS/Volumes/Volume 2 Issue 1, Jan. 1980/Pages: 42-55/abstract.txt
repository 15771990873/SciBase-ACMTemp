Discussed is a distributed system based on communication among disjoint processes, where each process is capable of achieving a post-condition of its local space in such a way that the conjunction of local post-conditions implies a global post-condition of the whole system. The system is then augmented with extra control communication in order to achieve distributed termination, without adding new channels of communication. The algorithm is applied to a problem of constructing a sorted partition.
