Current norm-based automatic termination analysis techniques for logic programs can be split up into different components: inference of mode or type information, derivation of models, generation of well-founded orders, and verification of the termination conditions themselves. Although providing high-precision results, these techniques suffer from an efficiency point of view, as several of these analyses are often performed through abstract interpretation. We present a new termination analysis which integrates the various components and produces a set of constraints that, when solvable, identifies successful termination proofs. The proposed method is both efficient and precise. The use of constraint sets enables the propagation on information over all different phases while the need for multiple analyses is considerably reduced.
