This article reports on an error-repair algorithm for LR parsers. It locally inserts, deletes or shifts symbols at the positions where errors are detected, thus modifying the right context in order to resume parsing on a valid piece of input. This method improves on others in that it does not require the user to provide additional information about the repair process, it does not require precalculation of auxiliary tables, and it can be easily integrated into existing LR parser generators. A Yacc-based implementation is presented along with some experimental results and comparisons with other well-known methods.
