We consider the problem of lightweight closure conversion, in which multiple procedure call protocols may coexist in the same code. A lightweight closure omits bindings for some of the free variables of the procedure that is represents. Flow analysis is used to match the protocol expected by each procedure and the protocol used at its possible call sites. We formulate the flow analysis as a deductive system that generates a labeled transition system and a set of constraints. We show that any solution to the constraints justifies the resulting transformation. Some of the techniques used are similar to those of abstract interpretation, but others appear to be novel.
