Error analysis involves the examination of a collection of programs whose errors are known. Each error is analyzed and validation techniques which would discover the error are identified. The errors that were present in version five of a package of Fortran scientific subroutines and then later corrected in version six were analyzed. An integrated collection of static and dynamic analysis methods would have discovered the errors in version five before its release. An integrated approach to validation and the effectiveness of individual methods are discussed.
