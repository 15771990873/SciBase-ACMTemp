A new algorithm for recognizing and parsing arbitrary context-free languages is presented, and several new results are given on the computational complexity of these problems. The new algorithm is of both practical and theoretical interest. It is conceptually simple and allows a variety of efficient implementations, which are worked out in detail. Two versions are given which run in faster than cubic time. Surprisingly close connections between the Cocke-Kasami-Younger and Earley algorithms are established which reveal that the two algorithms are “almost” identical.
