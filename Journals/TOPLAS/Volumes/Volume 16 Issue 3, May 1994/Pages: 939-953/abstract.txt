This article presents a solution to thefirst-come, first-enabled&ell;-exclusion
problem of Fischer et al. [1979]. Unlike their solution, this
solution does not use powerful read-modify-write synchronization
primitives and requires only bounded shared memory. Use of theconcurrent timestamp systemof Dolev
and Shavir [1989] is key in solving the problem within bounded shared
memory.
