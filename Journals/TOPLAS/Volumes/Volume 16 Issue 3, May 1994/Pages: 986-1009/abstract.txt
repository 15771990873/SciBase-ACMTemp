We present a method for constructing replicated services that retain their availability and integrity despite several servers and clients being corrupted by an intruder, in addition to others failing benignly. We also address the issue of maintaining a causal order among client requests. We illustrate a security breach resulting from an intruder's ability to effect a violation of causality in the sequence of requests processed by the service and propose an approach to counter this attack. An important and novel feature of our techniques is that the client need not be able to identify or authenticate even a single server. Instead, the client is required to possess only a single public key for the service. We demonstrate the performance of our techniques with a service we have implemented using one of our protocols.
