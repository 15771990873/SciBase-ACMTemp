Afirst-order multiparty interactionis an abstraction mechanism that defines communication among a set offormal process roles. Actual processes participate in a first-order interaction byenrolinginto roles, and execution of the interaction can proceed when all roles are filled by distinct processes. As in CSP, enrolement statements can serve as guards in alternative commands. Theenrolement guard-scheduling problemthen is to enable the execution of first-order interactions through the judicious scheduling of roles to processes that are currently ready to execute enrolement guards.We present a fully distributed and message-efficient algorithm for the enrolement guard-scheduling problem, the first such  solution of which we are aware. We also describe several extensions of the algorithm, including:generic roles; dynamically changing environments, where processes can be created and destroyed at run time; andnested-enrolement, which allows interactions to be nested.
