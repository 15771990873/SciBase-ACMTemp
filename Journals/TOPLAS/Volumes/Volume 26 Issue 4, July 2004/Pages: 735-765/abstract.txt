Graph-coloring register allocators eliminate copies by coalescing the source and target nodes of a copy if they do not interfere in the interference graph. Coalescing, however, can be harmful to the colorability of the graph because it tends to yield a graph with nodes of higher degrees. Unlikeaggressive coalescing, which coalesces any pair of noninterfering copy-related nodes,conservative coalescingoriterated coalescingperform safe coalescing that preserves the colorability. Unfortunately, these heuristics give up coalescing too early, losing many opportunities for coalescing that would turn out to be safe. Moreover, they ignore the fact that coalescing may even improve the colorability of the graph by reducing the degree of neighbor nodes that are interfering with both the source and target nodes being coalesced. This article proposes a new heuristic calledoptimistic coalescingwhich optimistically performs aggressive coalescing, thus exploiting the positive impact of coalescing aggressively, but when a coalesced node is to be spilled, it is split back into separate nodes. Since there is a better chance of coloring one of those splits, we can reduce the overall spill amount.
