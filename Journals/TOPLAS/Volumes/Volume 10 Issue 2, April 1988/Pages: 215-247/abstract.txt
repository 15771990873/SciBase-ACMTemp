A language model is presented for the specification of User Interface Management Systems. The model, called the Abstract Interaction Tool (AIT) model, offers a tree-like hierarchy of interaction objects. Each object represents a subtree and can be considered as an abstract input device containing a syntax-like specification of the required input pattern. The hierarchy of specifications amounts to a system of syntactical productions with multiple control. Terminal nodes of the AIT tree represent the interface to the physical interaction devices. The AIT model features hierarchical output resource management. At the higher, more abstract, level the input-output is loosely coupled. At lower levels the coupling becomes increasingly tight. At the upper levels, AITs model the functions (what) required by the user, whereas at the lower levels the way to accomplish them (how) is stressed. The AIT model has modes for multithread and multiple-device user interaction. There are facilities for context-dependent prompting, echoing, feedback, error correction, and expertise levels. A special section in the AIT provides for links to application modules. As a model for general interactive systems, AITs can be applied to graphics, process control, dialogue, and real-time systems. AITs can also be used to define controlled production rules in knowledge-based systems. In addition the model can provide tools for the software engineering phases specification and prototyping.
