The problem of computing the maximum ofninputs on an asynchronous parallel computer is considered. In general, the inputs may arrive staggered in time, the number of processors available to the maximization algorithm may vary during its execution, and the number of inputs,n, may be initially unknown. Two simple, efficient algorithms to compute the maximum are presented. Each algorithm may be invoked asynchronously, as new inputs and processors arrive. Performance measures that account for the response times of the invocations are introduced, and the algorithms are analyzed under these measures.
