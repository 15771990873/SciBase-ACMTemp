Graph rewrite systems can be used to specify and generate program optimizations. For termination of the systems several rule-based criteria are developed, definingexhaustive graph rewrite systems. For nondeterministic systemsstratificationis introduced which automatically selects single normal forms. To illustrate how far the methodology reaches, parts of the lazy code motion optimization are specified. The resulting graph rewrite system classes can be evaluated  by a uniform algorithm, which forms the basis for the optimizer generator OPTIMIX. With this tool several optimizer components have been generated, and some numbers on their speed are presented.
