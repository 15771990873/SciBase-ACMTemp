The control dependence relation plays a fundamental role in program restructuring and optimization. The usual representation of this relation is the control dependence graph (CDG), but the size of the CDG can grow quadratically with the input programs, even for structured programs. In this article, we introduce the augmented postdominator tree(APT), a data structure which can be constructed in space and time proportional to the size of the program and which supports enumeration of a number of useful control dependence sets in time proportional to their size. Therefore,APTprovides an optimal representation of control dependence. Specifically, theAPTdata structure supports enumeration of the set cd(e), which is the set of statements control dependent on control-flow edge e, of the setconds(w), which is the set of edges on which statementwis dependent, and of the setcdequiv(w), which is the set of statements having the same control dependences asw. Technically,APTcan be viewed as a factored representation of the CDG where queries are processed using an approach known as filtering search.
