A persistent programming environment, together with a language that supports first class procedures, may be used to provide the semantic features of other object modeling languages. In particular, the two concepts may be combined to implement abstract data types, modules, separate compilation, views, and data protection. Furthermore, the ideas may be used in system construction and version control, as demonstrated here.
