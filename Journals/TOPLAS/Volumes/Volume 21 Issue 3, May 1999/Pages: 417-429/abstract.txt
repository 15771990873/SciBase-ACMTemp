Grover's search algorithm is designed to be executed on a quantum-mechanical computer. In this article, the probabilisticwp-calculus is used to model and reason about Grover's algorithm. It is demonstrated that the calculus provides a rigorous programming notation for modeling this and other quantum algorithms and that it also provides a systematic framework of analyzing such algorithms.
