The Hindley/Milner let-polymorphic type inference system has two different algorithms: one is thede factostandard AlgorithmWthat is bottom-up (or context-insensitive), and the other is a “folklore” algorithm that is top-down (or context-sensitive). Because the latter algorithm has not been formally presented with its soundness and completeness proofs, and its relation with theWalgorithm has not been rigorously investigated, its use in place of (or in combination with)Wis not well founded. In this article, we formally define the context-sensitive, top-down type inference algorithm (named “M”), prove its soundness and completeness, and show a distinguishing property thatMalways stops earlier thanWif the input program is  ill typed. Our proofs can be seen as theoretical justifications for various type-checking strategies being used in practice.
