This article relates two different paradigms of descriptions of communication behavior, one focusing on global message flows and another on end-point behaviors, using formal calculi based on session types. The global calculus, which originates from a Web service description language (W3C WS-CDL), describes an interaction scenario from a vantage viewpoint; the end-point calculus, an applied typedÏ€-calculus, precisely identifies a local behavior of each participant. We explore a theory of end-point projection, by which we can map a global description to its end-point counterparts preserving types and dynamics. Three principles of well-structured description and the type structures play a fundamental role in the theory.
