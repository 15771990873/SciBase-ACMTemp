In the article “On the Conversion of Indirect to Direct Recursion”(ACM Lett. Program. Lang. 2,1-4. pp. 151-164), a method was introduced to convert indirect to direct recursion. It was claimed that for any call graph, there is a mutual-recursion elimination sequence if and only if no strongly connected component contains two node-disjoint circuits. We first give a counterexample and then provide a correction.
