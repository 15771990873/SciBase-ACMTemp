A simple and efficient algorithm for generating bottom-up rewrite system (BURS) tables is described. A small code-generator generator implementation produces BURS tables efficiently, even for complex instruction set descriptions. The algorithm does not require novel data structures or complicated algorithmic techniques. Previously published methods for on-the-fly elimination of states are generalized and simplified to create a new method, triangle trimming, that is employed in the algorithm. A prototype implementation, burg, generates BURS tables very efficiently.
