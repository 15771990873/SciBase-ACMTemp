Proof Carrying Code provides trust in mobile code by requiring certificates that ensure the code adherence to specific conditions. The prominent approach to generate certificates for compiled code is Certifying Compilation, that automatically generates certificates for simple safety properties.In this work, we present Certificate Translation, a novel extension for standard compilers that automatically transforms formal proofs for more expressive and complex properties of the source program to certificates for the compiled code.The article outlines the principles of certificate translation, instantiated for a nonoptimizing compiler and for standard compiler optimizations in the context of an intermediate RTL Language.
