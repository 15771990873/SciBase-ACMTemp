We study an asynchronous distributed π-calculus, with constructs for localities and migration. We show that a static analysis ensures the receptiveness of channel names, which, together with a simple type system, guarantees themessage deliverabilityproperty. This property states that any migrating message will find an appropriate receiver at its destination locality. We argue that this distributed, receptive calculus is still expressive enough while allowing for an effective type inference à la ML.
