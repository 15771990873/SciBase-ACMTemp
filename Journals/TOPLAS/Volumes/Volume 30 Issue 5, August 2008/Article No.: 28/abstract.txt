Object layout schemes used in C++ and other languages rely on (sometimes numerous) compiler generated fields. We describe a language-independent object layout scheme, which is space optimal, that is, objects are contiguous, and containno compiler generated fieldsother than a single type identifier. As in C++ and other multiple inheritance languages such as CECIL and DYLAN, the new scheme sometimes requires extra levels of indirection to access some of the fields. Using a data set of 28 hierarchies, totaling almost 50,000 types, we show that this scheme improves field access efficiency over standard implementations, and competes favorably with (the non-space-optimal) highly optimized C++ specific implementations. The benchmark includes an analytical model for computing the frequency of indirections in a sequence of field access operations. Our layout scheme relies on whole-program analysis, which requires about 10 microseconds per type on a contemporary architecture (Pentium III, 900Mhz, 256MB machine), even in very large hierarchies. We also present a layout scheme for separate compilation using the user-annotation ofvirtual inheritance edgethat is used in C++.
