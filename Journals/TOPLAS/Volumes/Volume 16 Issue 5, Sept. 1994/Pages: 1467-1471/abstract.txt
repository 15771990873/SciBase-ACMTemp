Alias analysis is a prerequisite for performing most of the common program analyses such as reaching-definitions analysis or live-variables analysis. Landi [1992] recently established that it is impossible to compute statically precise alias information—either may-alias or must-alias—in languages with if statements, loops, dynamic storage, and recursive data structures: more precisely, he showed that the may-alias relation is not recursive, while the must-alias relation is not even recursively enumerable. This article presents simpler proofs of the same results.
