Conversion algorithms are presented that would enable programmers to write programs in a high-level, data flow language and then run those programs on a synchronous machine. A model of interprocess communication systems is developed in which both data-driven and synchronous execution modes are represented. Balancing equations are used to characterize a subclass of parallel programs, called loop programs, for which conversions are possible. We show that all loop programs having the finite buffer property can be converted into synchronous mode. Finally two algorithms for the conversion of loop programs are presented and discussed.
