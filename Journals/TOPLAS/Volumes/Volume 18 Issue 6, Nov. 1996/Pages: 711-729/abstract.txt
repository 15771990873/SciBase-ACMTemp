This article formally defines Eiffel dynamic binding in presence of renaming and redefinition. Message passing, inheritance, and polymorphism are expressed in an operational style using natural semantics. From the formal specification, we derive an algorithm to determine the appropriate version of a feature to apply to a given object. This algorithm, based only on the class hierarchy and not using any intermediate structure, gives a practical approach to the understanding of inheritance, renaming, and redefinition in Eiffel.
