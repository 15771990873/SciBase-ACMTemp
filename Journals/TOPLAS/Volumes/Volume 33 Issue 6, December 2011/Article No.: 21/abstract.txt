In this article we provide an interprocedural analysis of linear two-variable equalities. The novel algorithm has a worst-case complexity of &Oscr;(nâ‹…k4), wherekis the number of variables andnis the program size. Thus, it saves a factor ofk4in comparison to a related algorithm based on full linear algebra. We also indicate how the practical runtime can be further reduced significantly. The analysis can be applied, for example, for register coalescing, for identifying local variables and thus for interprocedurally observing stack pointer modifications as well as for an analysis of array index expressions, when analyzing low-level code.
