Compiler-component generators, such as lexical analyzer generators and parser generators, have long been used to facilitate the construction of compilers. A tree-manipulation language calledtwighas been developed to help construct efficient code generators.Twigtransforms a tree-translation scheme into a code generator that combines a fast top-down tree-pattern matching algorithm with dynamic programming.Twighas been used to specify and construct code generators for several experimental compilers targeted for different machines.
