An approach to proving temporal properties of concurrent programs that does not use temporal logic as an inference system is presented. The approach is based on using Buchi automata to specify properties. To show that a program satisfies a given property, proof obligations are derived from the Buchi automata specifying that property. These obligations are discharged by devising suitable invariant assertions and variant functions for the program. The approach is shown to be sound and relatively complete. A mutual exclusion protocol illustrates its application.
