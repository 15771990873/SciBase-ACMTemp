A systematic representation of objects grouped into types by constructions similar to the composition of sets in mathematics is proposed. The representation is by lambda expressions, which supports the representation of objects from function spaces. The representation is related to a rather conventional language of type descriptions in a way that is believed to be new. Ordinary control-expressions (i.e.,case- and let-expressions) are derived from the proposed representation.
