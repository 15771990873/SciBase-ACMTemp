We present a simple and efficient algorithm for the FIFO allocation ofkidentical resources among asynchronous processes that communicate via shared memory. The algorithm simulates a shared queue but uses exponentially fewer shared memory values, resulting in practical savings of time and space as well as program complexity. The algorithm is robust against process failure through unannounced stopping, making it attractive also for use in an environment of processes of widely differing speeds. In addition to its practical advantages, we show that for fixedk, the shared space complexity of the algorithm as a function of the numberNof processes is optimal to within a constant factor.
