An efficient algorithm for communicating letter-shape information from a high-speed computer with a large memory to a typesetting device that has a limited memory is presented. The encoding is optimum, in the sense that the total time for typesetting is minimized, using a model that generalizes well-known “demand paging” strategies to the case where changes to the cache are allowed before the associated information is actually needed. Extensive empirical data show that good results are obtained even when difficult technical material is being typeset on a machine that can store information concerning only 100 characters. The methods of this paper are also applicable to other hardware and software caching applications with restricted lookahead.
