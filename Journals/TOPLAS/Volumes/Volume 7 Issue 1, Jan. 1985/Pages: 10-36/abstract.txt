A specification technique, formally equivalent to finite-state machines, is offered as an alternative because it is inherently distributed and more comprehensible. When applied to modules whose complexity is dominated by control, the technique guides the analyst to an effective decomposition of complexity, encourages well-structured error handling, and offers an opportunity for parallel computation. When applied to distributed protocols, the technique provides a unique perspective and facilitates automatic detection of some classes of error. These applications are illustrated by a controller for a distributed telephone system and the full-duplex alternating-bit protocol for data communication. Several schemes are presented for executing the resulting specifications.
