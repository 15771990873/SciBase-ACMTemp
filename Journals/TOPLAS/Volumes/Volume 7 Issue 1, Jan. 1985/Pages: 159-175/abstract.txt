The traditional LALR analysis is reexamined using a new operator and an associated graph. An improved method that allows factoring out a crucial part of the computation for defining states of LR(0) canonical collection and for computing LALR(1) lookahead sets is presented. This factorization leads to significantly improved algorithms with respect to execution time as well as storage requirements. Experimental results including comparison with other known methods are presented.
