Until recently, information-flow analysis has been used primarily to verify that information transmission between program variables cannot violate security requirements. Here, the notion of information flow is explored as an aid to program development and validation.Information-flow relations are presented for while-programs, which identify those program statements whose execution may cause information to be transmitted from or to particular input, internal, or output values. It is shown with examples how these flow relations can be helpful in writing, testing, and updating programs; they also usefully extend the class of errors which can be detected automatically in the “static analysis” of a program.
