In his recent paper, “Communicating Sequential Processes” (Comm. ACM21, 8 (Aug. 1978), 666-677), C.A.R. Hoare outlines a programming language notation for interprocess communication in which processes are synchronized by the messages they exchange. The notation carries with it certain implications for the synchronization protocols required in a message transfer. These are not at all obvious and are made explicit here. An alternative convention is suggested in which communication and synchronization are partially uncoupled from one another.
