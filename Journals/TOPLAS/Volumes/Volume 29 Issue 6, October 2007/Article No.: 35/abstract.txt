Fingerprinting embeds a secret message into a cover message. In media fingerprinting, the secret is usually a copyright notice and the cover a digital image. Fingerprinting an object discourages intellectual property theft, or when such theft has occurred, allows us to prove ownership.The Software Fingerprinting problem can be described as follows. Embed a structureWinto a programPsuch that:Wcan be reliably located and extracted fromPeven afterPhas been subjected to code transformations such as translation, optimization and obfuscation;Wis stealthy;Whas a high data rate; embeddingWintoPdoes not adversely affect the performance ofP; andWhas a mathematical property that allows us to argue that its presence inPis the result of deliberate actions.In this article, we describe a software fingerprinting technique in which a dynamic graph fingerprint is stored in the execution state of a program. Because of the hardness of pointer alias analysis such fingerprints are difficult to attack automatically.
