Boxed Ambientsare a variant of Mobile Ambients that result from dropping the open capability and introducing new primitives for ambient communication. The new model of communication is faithful to the principles of distribution and location-awareness of Mobile Ambients, and complements the constructs in and out for mobility with finer-grained mechanisms for ambient interaction. We introduce the new calculus, study the impact of the new mechanisms for communication of typing and mobility, and show that they yield an effective framework for resource protection and access control in distributed systems.
