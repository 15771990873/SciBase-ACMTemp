We show that the accuracy of online partial evaluation, or polyvariant specialization based on constant propagation, can be simulated by offline partial evaluation using a maximally polyvariant binding-time analysis. We point out that, while their accuracy is the same, online partial evaluation offers better opportunities for powerful generalization strategies. Our results are presented using a flowchart language with recursive procedures.
