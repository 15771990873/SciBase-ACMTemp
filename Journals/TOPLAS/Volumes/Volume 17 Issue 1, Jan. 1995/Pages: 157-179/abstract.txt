The definitions of the predicates Possibly &fgr; and Definitely &fgr;, where &fgr; is a global predicate of a distributed computation, lead to the definitions of two predicate transformersPandD. We show thatPplays the same role with respect totimeas the predicate transformersKiin knowledge theory play with respect tospace. Pursuing this analogy, we prove that local predicates are exactly the fixed points of theKi's while the stable predicates are the fixed points ofP. In terms of the predicate transformersPandD, we define a new class of predicates that we callobserver-independentpredicates and for which the detection of Possibly &fgr; and Definitely &fgr; is quite easy. Finally, we establish a temporal counterpart to the knowledge change theorem of Chandy and Misra which formally proves that the global view of a distributed system provided by its various observations does not differ too much from its truth behavior.
