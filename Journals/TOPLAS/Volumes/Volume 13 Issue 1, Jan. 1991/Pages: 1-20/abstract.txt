Linking is traditionally a batch process that resolves cross-references between object modules and run-time libraries to produce a stand-alone executable image. Because most program changes only involve a small part of the program, we have implemented an incremental linker, named Inclink, that processes only the changed modules. Inclink generates a new executable in time proportional to the size of change; in contrast, a batch linker generates an executable in time proporitonal to the size of the program. To minimize updates to the executable, Inclink allocates extra space for every module. By allocating 24 percent more space in the executable for overflows, Inclink can update a module in place over 97 percent of the time. Measurements show that Inclink is more than an order of    magnitude faster than the UNIX [2]  batch linker and that 88 percent of all links will take less than 2 s of CPU time on a MicroVAX-2, independent of program size.
