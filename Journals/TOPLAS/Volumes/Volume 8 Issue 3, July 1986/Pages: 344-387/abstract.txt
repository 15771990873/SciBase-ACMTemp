A language for describing communicating systems is described. It is sufficiently expressive to describe both the desired behavior of systems, theirspecifications, and their actualimplementationsin terms of simpler components. We sayIsatisfiesSif1is a correct implementation of the specificationS. We briefly discuss a semantic treatment of this notion of satisfaction, but the main emphasis of the paper is on a proof technique for proving statements of the formIsatisfiesS, based on syntactic transformations and induction. Two examples are given, both systolic systems from the literature.
