We propose a methodology for the development of concurrent programs and apply it to an important class of problems: quiescence detection. The methodology is based on a novel view of programs. A key feature of the methodology is the separation of concerns between the core problem to be solved and details of the forms of concurrency employed in the target architecture and programming language. We begin development of concurrent programs by ignoring issues dealing with concurrency and introduce such concerns in manageable doses. The class of problems solved includes termination and deadlock detection.
