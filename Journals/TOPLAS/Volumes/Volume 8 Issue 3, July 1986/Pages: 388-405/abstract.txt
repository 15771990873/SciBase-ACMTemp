The problem of correctness of the solutions to the distributed termination problem of Francez [7] is addressed. Correctness criteria are formalized in the customary framework for program correctness. A very simple proof method is proposed and applied to show correctness of a solution to the problem. It allows us to reason about liveness properties of temporal logic (see, e.g., Manna and Pnueli [12]) using a new notion ofweak total correctness.
