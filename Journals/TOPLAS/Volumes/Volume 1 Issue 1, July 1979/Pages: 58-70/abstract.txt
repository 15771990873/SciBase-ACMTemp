An incremental parser is a device which is able to perform syntax analysis in an incremental way, avoiding complete reparsing of a program after each modification. The incremental parser presented extends the conventional LR parsing algorithm and its performance is compared with that of a conventional parser. Suggestions for an implementation and possible extensions to other parsing methods are also discussed.
