A fast algorithm for finding dominators in a flowgraph is presented. The algorithm uses 
depth-first search and an efficient method of computing functions defined on paths in trees. A simple implementation of the algorithm runs inO(mlogn) time, wheremis the number of edges andnis the number of vertices in the problem graph. A more sophisticated implementation runs inO(m&agr;(m,n)) time, where &agr;(m,n) is a functional inverse of Ackermann's function.Both versions of the algorithm were implemented in Algol W, a Stanford University version of Algol, and tested on an IBM 370/168. The programs were compared with an implementation by Purdom and Moore of a straightforwardO(mn)-time algorithm, and with a bit vector algorithm described by Aho and Ullman. The fast algorithm beat the straightforward algorithm and the bit vector algorithm on all but the smallest graphs tested.
