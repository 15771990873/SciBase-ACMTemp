A formal refinement calculus targeted at system-level descriptions in the IEEE standard hardware description  language VHDL is described here. Refinement can be used to develop hardware description code that is “correct by construction”. the calculus is closely related to a Hoare-style programming logic for VHDL and real-time systems in general. That logic and a semantics for a core subset of VHDL are described. The programming logic and the associated refinement calculus are shown to becomplete.This means that if there is a code that can be shown to implement a given specification, then it will be derivable from the specification via the calculus.
