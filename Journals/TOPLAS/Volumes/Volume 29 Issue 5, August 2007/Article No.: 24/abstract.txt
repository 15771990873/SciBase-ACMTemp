We present a precise correspondence between separation logic and a simple notion ofpredicateBI, extending the earlier correspondence given between part of separation logic andpropositionalBI. Moreover, we introduce the notion of a BI hyperdoctrine, show that it soundly models classical and intuitionistic first- and higher-order predicate BI, and use it to show that we may easily extend separation logic tohigher-order. We also demonstrate that this extension is important for program proving, since it provides sound reasoning principles for data abstraction in the presence of aliasing.
