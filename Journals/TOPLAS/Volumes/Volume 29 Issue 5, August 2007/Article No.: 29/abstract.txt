We consider integer arithmetic modulo a power of 2 as provided
by mainstream programming languages like Java or standard
implementations of C. The difficulty here is that, forw> 1, the ringZmof integers modulom= 2whas zero divisors and thus cannot
be embedded into a field. Not withstanding that, we present intra-
and interprocedural algorithms for inferring for every program
pointuaffine relations between program variables valid atu. If conditional branching is replaced with
nondeterministic branching, our algorithms are not only sound but
alsocompletein that they detectallvalid affine
relations in a natural class of programs. Moreover, they run in
time linear in the program size and polynomial in the number of
program variables and can be implemented by using the same modular
integer arithmetic as the target language to be analyzed. We also
indicate how our analysis can be extended to deal with equality
guards, even in an interprocedural setting.
