An algorithm for detecting deadlocks in distributed systems with CSP-like communication is proposed. Unlike previous work, the proposed algorithm avoidsperiodicallysending deadlock-detecting messages by the processes and requires no local storage for the processes with size predetermined by the number of processes in the system. The algorithm is proven to have the following properties: (0) it never detectsfalsedeadlocks; (1) it has only one process in aknotreport the deadlock; and (2) it detects everytruedeadlock in finite time.
