A record data type can beextendedby addition of more fields. The extended type is a subtype of the original, in that any value of the extended type can be regarded as a value of the original type by ignoring the additional fields. This results in a type hierarchy.Milner [3] has proposed a polymorphic type system. With the Milner approach, the type of a function may contain type variables. This also results in a type hierarchy.In a language with a polymorphic type system, if it is anticipated that a record type will need to be extended, then the record type can be defined to have a dummyextension field. In the parent type, the extension field will havenullcontents of typevoid. The type of the extension field can differ with different subtypes.The approach can be extended to allow a type to be subtype of two or more parent types.To a limited extent, this approach can be used in Ada and other languages with generic program units.
