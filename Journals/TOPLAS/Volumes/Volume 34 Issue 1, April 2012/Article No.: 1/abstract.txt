TOPLAS will have four issues per year from now on&excel; The goal is to have each of the four issues contain 5--6 articles, instead of the previous schedule of six issues that each typically contained 3--4 articles.Historically, TOPLAS had four issues per volume from 1980 to 1992, and all but three of those issues contained 5 or more articles. I hope that the TOPLAS readers will enjoy the fewer, thicker issues of TOPLAS.I thank the associate editors who continue to serve TOPLAS, and I also thank Wei Li and Aaron Stump who in the Winter of 2012 reached the end of their terms and stepped down as associate editors.Welcome to Michael Hicks who is a new associate editor.
