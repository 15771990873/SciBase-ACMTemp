Dijkstra [4, 5] introduced the problem of self-stabilization in distributed systems as an interesting exercise for achieving global convergence through local actions. In [4] he presented three solutions to a specific version of the self-stabilization problem, one of which was proved in [6]. This paper presents an alternative solution of his self-stabilization problem with four-state machines.
