Themultiway rendezvousis a natural generalization of the rendezvous in which more than two processes may participate. The utility of the multiway rendezvous is illustrated by solutions to a variety of problems. To make their simplicity apparent, these solutions are written using a construct tailor-made to support the multiway rendezvous. The degree of support for multiway rendezvous applications by several well-known languages that support the two-way rendezvous is examined. Since such support for the multiway rendezvous is found to be inadequate, well-integrated extensions to these languages are considered that would help provide such support.
