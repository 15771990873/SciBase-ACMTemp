A finite buffer with time constraints on the rate of accepting inputs, producing outputs, and message latency is specified using both Timed CSP and a new real-time specification language, CSP + T, which adds expressive power to some of the sequential aspects of CSP and allows the description of complex event timings from within a single sequential process. On the other hand, Timed CSP encourages event-timing descriptions to be built up in a constraint-oriented manner with the parallel composition of several processes. Although these represent two complementary specification styles, both provide valuable insights into the specification of complex event timings.
