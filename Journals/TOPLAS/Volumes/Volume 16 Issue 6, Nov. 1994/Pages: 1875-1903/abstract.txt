We present a language-independent semantic model of the process of combining changes to programs. This model extends the domains used in denotational semantics (complete partial orders) to Boolean algebras, and represents incompatible modifications as well as compatible extensions. The model is used to define the intended semantics of change-merging operations on programs and to establish some general properties of software merging. We determine conditions under which changes to subprograms of a software system can be merged independently and illustrate cases where this is not possible.
