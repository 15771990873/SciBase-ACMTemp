In this article, we discuss two programming language features that have value for expressibility and efficiency: nonstrictness and nondeterminism. Our work arose while assessing ways to enhance a currently successful language, SISAL [McGraw et al. 1985]. The questions of how best to include these features, if at all, has led not to conclusions but to an impetus to explore the answers in an objective way. We will retain strictness for efficiency reasons and explore the limits it may impose, and we will experiment with a carefully controlled form of nondeterminism to assess its expressive power.
