We propose an extension toATL(alternating-time temporal logic), calledBSIL(basic strategy-interaction logic), for specifying collaboration among agents in a multiagent system. We show that BSIL is strictly more expressive than ATL+but incomparable with ATL&ast;,GL(game logic), andAMC(alternating Î¼-calculus) in expressiveness. We show that a memoryful strategy is necessary for fulfilling a specification in BSIL. We establish that the BSIL model-checking problem is PSPACE-complete. However, BSIL model checking can be performed in time quadratic in the model for fixed formulas. The BSIL (and hence ATL+) satisfiability is 2EXPTIME-complete. Finally, we report our experiment with a model checker for BSIL.
