A class of parallel processors potentially involving thousands of individual processing elements is described. The architecture is based on the perfect shuffle connection and has two favorable characteristics: (1) Each processor communicates with a fixed number of other processors. (2) Important communication functions can be accomplished in time proportional to the logarithm of the number of processors. A number of basic algorithms for these “ultracomputers” are presented, and physical design considerations are discussed in a preliminary fashion.
