Although the use of abstract types has been widely advocated as a specification and implementation technique, their use has often been associated with programming languages that are not widely available, and examples published to date are rarely taken from actual applications. SIMULA is a widely available language that supports the use of abstract types. The purposes of this paper are (1) to demonstrate the application of the concepts of data abstraction to a common problem; (2) to demonstrate the use of data abstraction in a widely available language; and (3) to provide a portable facility for statistics collection that may make the use of SIMULA more attractive. A discussion of the background of and requirements for an abstract type for statistics collection is presented, followed by a specification for the type using traces. A SIMULA implementation, with examples of its use, is given. Finally, implementation of the abstract type in other languages is discussed.
