An algorithm for prettyprinting is given. For an input stream of lengthnand an output device with linewidthm, the algorithm requires timeO(n) and spaceO(m). The algorithm is described in terms of two parallel processes: the first scans the input stream to determine the space required to print logical blocks of tokens; the second uses this information to decide where to break lines of text; the two processes communicate by means of a buffer of sizeO(m). The algorithm does not wait for the entire stream to be input, but begins printing as soon as it has received a full line of input. The algorithm is easily implemented.
