SNOBOL4 is best known for its string processing facilities, which are based on patterns as data objects. Despite the demonstrated success of patterns, there are many shortcomings associated with their use. The concept of patterns in SNOBOL4 is examined and problem areas are discussed. An alternative method for high-level string processing is described. This method, implemented in the programming language Icon, employsgenerators, which are capable of producing alternative values. Generators, coupled with a goal-driven method of expression evaluation, provide the string processing facilities of SNOBOL4 without the disadvantages associated with patterns. Comparisons between SNOBOL4 and Icon are included and the broader implications of the new approach are discussed.
