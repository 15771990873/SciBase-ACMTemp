A method of documenting exception propagation and handling in Ada programs is proposed. Exception propagation declarations are introduced as a new component of Ada specifications, permitting documentation of those exceptions that can be propagated by a subprogram. Exception handlers are documented by entry assertions. Axioms and proof rules for Ada exceptions given. These rules are simple extensions of previous rules for Pascal and define an axiomatic semantics of Ada exceptions. As a result, Ada programs specified according to the method can be analyzed by formal proof techniques for consistency with their specifications, even if they employ exception propagation and handling to achieve required results (i.e., nonerror situations). Example verifications are given.
