It is shown that the termination detection problem for distributed computations can be modeled as an instance of the garbage collection problem. Consequently, algorithms for the termination detection problem are obtained by applying transformations to garbage collection algorithms. The transformation can be applied to collectors of the “mark-and-sweep” type as well as to reference-counting protocol of Lermen and Maurer, the weighted-reference-counting protocol, the local-reference-counting protocol, and Ben-Ari's mark-and-sweep collector into termination detection algorithms. Known termination detection algorithms as well as new variants are obtained.
