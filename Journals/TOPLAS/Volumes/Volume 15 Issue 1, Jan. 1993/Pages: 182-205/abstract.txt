This paper examines cache consistency conditions for multiprocessor shared memory systems. It states and motivates a weaker condition than is normally implemented. An algorithm is presented that exploits the weaker condition to achieve greater concurrency. The algorithm is shown to satisfy the weak consistency condition. Other properties of the algorithm and possible extensions are discussed.
