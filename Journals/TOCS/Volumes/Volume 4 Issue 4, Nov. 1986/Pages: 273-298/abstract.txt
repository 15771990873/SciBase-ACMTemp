Using simulation, we examine the efficiency of several distributed, hardware-based solutions to the cache coherence problem in shared-bus multiprocessors. For each of the approaches, the associated protocol is outlined. The simulation model is described, and results from that model are presented. The magnitude of the potential performance difference between the various approaches indicates that the choice of coherence solution is very important in the design of an efficient shared-bus multiprocessor, since it may limit the number of processors in the system.
