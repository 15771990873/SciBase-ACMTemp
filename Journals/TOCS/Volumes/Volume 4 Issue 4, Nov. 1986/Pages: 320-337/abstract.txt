We propose a distributed deadlock detection algorithm for distributed computer systems. We consider two types of resources, depending on whether the remote resource lock granularity and mode can or cannot be determined without access to the remote resource site. We present the algorithm, its performance analysis, and an informal argument about its correctness. The proposed algorithm has a hierarchical design intended to detect the most frequent deadlocks with maximum efficiency.
