This article presents a practical solution for the cyclic debugging of nondeterministic parallel programs. The solution consists of a combination of record/replay with automatic on-the-fly data race detection. This combination enables us to limit the record phase to the more efficient recording of the synchronization operations, while deferring the time-consuming data race detection to the replay phase. As the record phase is highly efficient, there is no need to switch it off, hereby eliminating the possibility of Heisenbugs because tracing can be left on all the time. This article describes an implementation of the tools needed to support RecPlay.
