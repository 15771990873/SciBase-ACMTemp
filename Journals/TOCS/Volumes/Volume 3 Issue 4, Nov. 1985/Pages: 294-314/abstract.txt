A new recursive algorithm for deriving the layout of parallel multipliers is presented. Based on this algorithm, a network for performing multiplications of two's complement numbers is proposed. The network can be implemented in a synchronous or an asynchronous way. If the factors to be multiplied haveNbits, the area complexity of the network isO(N2) for practical values ofNas in the case of cellular multipliers. Due to the design approach based on a recursive algorithm, a time complexityO(logN) is achieved.It is shown how the structure can he pipelined with period complexityO(1) and used for single and double precision multiplication.
