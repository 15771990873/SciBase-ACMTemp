Alpine is a file system that supports atomic transactions and is designed to operate as a service on a computer network. Alpine's primary purpose is to store files that represent databases. An important secondary goal is to store ordinary files representing documents, program modules, and the like.Unlike other file servers described in the literature, Alpine uses a log-based technique to implement atomic file update. Another unusual aspect of Alpine is that it performs all communication via a general-purpose remote procedure call facility. Both of these decisions have worked out well. This paper describes Alpine's design and implementation, and evaluates the system in light of our experience to date.Alpine is written in Cedar, a strongly typed modular programming language that includes garbage-collected storage. We report on using the Cedar language and programming environment to develop Alpine.
