A new digital multisignature scheme using bijective public-key cryptosystems that overcomes the problems of previous signature schemes used for multisignatures is proposed. The principal features of this scheme are (1) the length of a multisignature message is nearly equivalent to that for a singlesignature message; (2) by using a one-way hash function, multisignature generation and verification are processed in an efficient manner; (3) the order of signing is not restricted; and (4) this scheme can be constructed on any bijective public-key cryptosystem as well as the RSA scheme. In addition, it is shown that the new scheme is considered as safe as the public-key cryptosystem used in this new scheme. Some variations based on the scheme are also presented.
