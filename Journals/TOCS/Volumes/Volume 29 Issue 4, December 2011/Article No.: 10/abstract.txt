Publish-subscribe (pub-sub) is an emerging paradigm for building a large number of distributed systems. A wide area pub-sub system is usually implemented on an overlay network infrastructure to enable information dissemination from publishers to subscribers. Using an open overlay network raises several security concerns such as: confidentiality and integrity, authentication, authorization and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. In this article we present EventGuard, a framework for building secure wide-area pub-sub systems. The EventGuard architecture is comprised of three key components: (1) a suite of security guards that can be seamlessly plugged-into a content-based pub-sub system, (2) a scalable key management algorithm to enforce access control on subscribers, and (3) a resilient pub-sub network design that is capable of scalable routing, handling message dropping-based DoS attacks, and node failures. The design of EventGuard mechanisms aims at providing security guarantees while maintaining the systemâ€™s overall simplicity, scalability, and performance metrics. We describe an implementation of the EventGuard pub-sub system to show that EventGuard is easily stackable on any content-based pub-sub core. We present detailed experimental results that quantify the overhead of the EventGuard pub-sub system and demonstrate its resilience against various attacks.
