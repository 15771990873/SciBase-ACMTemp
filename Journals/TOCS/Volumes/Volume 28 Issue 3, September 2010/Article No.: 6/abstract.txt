Wireless mesh networks extend the connectivity range of mobile devices by using multiple access points, some of them connected to the Internet, to create a mesh topology and forward packets over multiple wireless hops. However, the quality of service provided by the mesh is impaired by the delays and disconnections caused by handoffs, as clients move within the area covered by multiple access points. We present the architecture and protocols of SMesh, the first transparent wireless mesh system that offers seamless, fast handoff, supporting real-time applications such as interactive VoIP. The handoff and routing logic is done solely by the access points, and therefore connectivity is attainable by any 802.11 device. In SMesh, the entire mesh network is seen by the mobile clients as a single, omnipresent access point, giving the mobile clients the illusion that they are stationary. We use multicast for access points coordination and, during handoff transitions, we use more than one access point to handle the moving client. SMesh provides a hybrid routing protocol that optimizes routes over wireless and wired links in a multihomed environment. Experimental results on a fully deployed mesh network demonstrate the effectiveness of the SMesh architecture and its intra-domain and inter-domain handoff protocols.
