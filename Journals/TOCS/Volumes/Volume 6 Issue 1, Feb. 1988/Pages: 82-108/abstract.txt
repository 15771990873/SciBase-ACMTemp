This paper describes QuickSilver, developed at the IBM Almaden Research Center, which usesatomic transactionsas a unified failure recovery mechanism for a client-server structured distributed system. Transactions allow failure atomicity for related activities at a single server or at a number of independent servers. Rather than bundling transaction management into a dedicated language or recoverable object manager, Quicksilver exposes the basic commit protocol and log recovery primitives, allowing clients and servers to tailor their recovery techniques to their specific needs. Servers can implement their own log recovery protocols rather than being required to use a system-defined protocol. These decisions allow servers to make their own choices to balance simplicity, efficiency, and recoverability.
