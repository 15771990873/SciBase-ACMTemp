A continuum of disk scheduling algorithms, V(R), having endpoints V(0) = SSTF and V(1) = SCAN, is defined. V(R) maintains a current SCAN direction (in or out) and services next the request with the smallesteffectivedistance. The effective distance of a request that lies in the current direction is its physical distance (in cylinders) from the read/write head. The effective distance of a request in the opposite direction is its physical distance plusRx (total number of cylinders on the disk). By use of simulation methods, it is shown that this definitional continuum also provides a continuum in performance, both with respect to the mean and with respect to the standard deviation of request waiting time. For objective functions that are linear combinations of the two measures,&mgr;w+kow, intermediate points of the continuum are seen to provide performance uniformly superior to both SSTF and SCAN. A method of implementing V(R) and the results of its experimental use in a real system are presented.
