We address the problem of automated derivation of functional test cases for real-time systems, by introducing techniques for generating test cases from formal specifications written in TRIO, a language that extends classical temporal logic to deal explicitly with time measures. We describe an interactive tool that has been built to implement these techniques, based on interpretation algorithms of the TRIO language. Several heuristic criteria are suggested to reduce drastically the size of the test cases that are generated. Experience in the use of the tool on real-life cases is reported.
