The V kernel supports an abstraction of processes, with operations for interprocess communication, process management, and memory management. This abstraction is used as a software base for constructing distributed systems. As a distributed kernel, the V kernel makes intermachine boundaries largely transparent.In this environment of many cooperating processes on different machines, there are many logicalgroupsof processes. Examples include the group of tile servers, a group of processes executing a particular job, and a group of processes executing a distributed parallel computation.In this paper we describe the extension of the V kernel to support process groups. Operations on groups include group interprocess communication, which provides an application-level abstraction of network multicast. Aspects of the implementation and performance, and initial experience with applications are discussed.
