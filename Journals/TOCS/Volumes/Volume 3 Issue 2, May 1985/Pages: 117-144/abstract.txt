Performance of a class of multistage interconnection networks employing redundant paths is investigated. Redundant path networks provide significant tolerance to faults at minimal costs; in this paper improvements in performance and very graceful degradation are also shown to result from the availability of redundant paths. A Markov model is introduced for the operation of these networks in the circuit-switched mode and is solved numerically to obtain the performance measures of interest. The structure of the networks that provide maximal performance is also characterized.
