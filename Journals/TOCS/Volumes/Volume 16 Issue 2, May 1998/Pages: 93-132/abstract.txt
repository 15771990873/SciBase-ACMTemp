The Totem multiple-ring protocol provides reliable totally ordered
delivery of messages across multiple local-area networks interconnected
by gateways. This consistent message order is maintained in the presence
of network partitioning and remerging, and of processor failure and
recovery. The protocol provides accurate topology change information as
part of the global total order of messages. It addresses the issue of
scalability and achieves a latency that increases logarithmically with
system size by exploiting process group locality and selective
forwarding of messages through the gateways. Pseudocode for the protocol
and an evaluation of its performance are given.â€”Authors' Abstract
