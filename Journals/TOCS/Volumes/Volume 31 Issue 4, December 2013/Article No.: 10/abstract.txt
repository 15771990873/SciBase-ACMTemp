CORFU is a global log which clients can append-to and read-from over a network. Internally, CORFU is distributed over a cluster of machines in such a way that there is no single I/O bottleneck to either appends or reads. Data is fully replicated for fault tolerance, and a modest cluster of about 16--32 machines with SSD drives can sustain 1 million 4-KByte operations per second.The CORFU log enabled the construction of a variety of distributed applications that require strong consistency at high speeds, such as databases, transactional key-value stores, replicated state machines, and metadata services.
