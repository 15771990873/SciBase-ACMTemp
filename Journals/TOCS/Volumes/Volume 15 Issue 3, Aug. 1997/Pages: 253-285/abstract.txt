We consider policies for CPU load balancing in networks of workstations. We address the question of whether preemptive migration (migrating active processes) is necessary, or whether remote execution (migrating processes only at the time of birth) is sufficient for load balancing. We show that resolving this issue is strongly tied to understanding the process lifetime distribution. Our measurements indicate that the distribution of lifetimes for a UNIX process is Pareto (heavy-tailed), with a consistent functional form over a variety of workloads. We show how to apply this distribution to derive a preemptive migration policy that requires no hand-tuned parameters. We used a trace-driven simulation to show that our preemptive migration strategy is far more effective than remote  execution, even when the memory transfer cost is high.
