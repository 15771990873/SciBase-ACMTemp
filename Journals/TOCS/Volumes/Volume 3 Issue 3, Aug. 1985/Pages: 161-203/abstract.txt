The current trend of computer system technology is toward CPUs with rapidly increasing processing power and toward disk drives of rapidly increasing density, but with disk performance increasing very slowly if at all. The implication of these trends is that at some point the processing power of computer systems will be limited by the throughput of the input/output (I/O) system.A solution to this problem, which is described and evaluated in this paper, isdisk cache. The idea is to buffer recently used portions of the disk address space in electronic storage. Empirically, it is shown that a large (e.g., 80-90 percent) fraction of all I/O requests are captured by a cache of an 8-Mbyte order-of-magnitude size for our workload sample. This paper considers a number of design parameters for such a cache (called cache disk or disk cache), including those that can be examined experimentally (cache location, cache size, migration algorithms, block sizes, etc.) and others (access time, bandwidth, multipathing, technology, consistency, error recovery, etc.) for which we have no relevant data or experiments. Consideration is given to both caches located in the I/O system, as with the storage controller, and those located in the CPU main memory. Experimental results are based on extensive trace-driven simulations using traces taken from three large IBM or IBM-compatible mainframe data processing installations. We find that disk cache is a powerful means of extending the performance limits of high-end computer systems.
