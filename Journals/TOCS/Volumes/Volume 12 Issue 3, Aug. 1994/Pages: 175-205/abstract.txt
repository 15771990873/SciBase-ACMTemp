An increasing number of architectures provide virtual memory support through software-managed TLBs. However, software management can impose considerable penalties that are highly dependent on the operating system's structure and its use of virtual memory. This work explores software-managed TLB design tradeoffs and their interaction with a range of monolithic and microkernel operating systems. Through hardware monitoring and simulation, we explore TLB performance for benchmarks running on a MIPS R2000-based workstation running Ultrix, OSF/1, and three versions of Mach 3.0.
