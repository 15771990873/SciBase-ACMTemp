Parity-encoded redundant disk arrays provide highly reliable, cost-effective secondary storage with high performance for reads and large writes. Their performance on small writes, however, is much worse than mirrored disks—the traditional, highly reliable, but expensive organization for secondary storage. Unfortunately, small writes are a substantial portion of the I/O workload of many important, demanding applications such as on-line transaction processing. This paper presentsparity logging, a novel solution to the small-write problem for redundant disk arrays. Parity logging applies journalling techniques to reduce substantially the cost of small writes. We provide detailed models of parity logging and competing schemes—mirroring, floating storage, and  RAID level 5—and verify these models by simulation. Parity logging provides performance competitive with mirroring, but with capacity overhead close to the minimum offered by RAID level 5. Finally, parity logging can exploit data caching more effectively than all three alternative approaches.
