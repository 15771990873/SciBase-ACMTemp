This article investigates the transient use of free local storage for improving performance in VM-based mobile computing systems implemented as thick clients on host PCs. We use the termTransientPC systemsto refer to these types of systems. The solution we propose, calledTransPart, uses the higher-performing local storage of host hardware to speed up performance-critical operations. Our solution constructs a virtual storage device on demand (which we calltransient storage) by borrowing free disk blocks from the hostâ€™s storage. In this article, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a TransPart prototype, which requires no modifications to the software or hardware of a host computer. Experimental results confirm that TransPart offers low overhead and startup cost, while improving user experience.
