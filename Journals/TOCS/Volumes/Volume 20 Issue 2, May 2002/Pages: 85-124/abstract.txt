Failure-resilient, scalable, and secure read-write access to shared information by mobile and static users over wireless and wired networks is a fundamental computing challenge. In this article, we describe how the Coda file system has evolved to meet this challenge through the development of mechanisms for server replication, disconnected operation, adaptive use of weak connectivity, isolation-only transactions, translucent caching, and opportunistic exploitation of hardware surrogates. For each mechanism, the article explains how usage experience with it led to the insights for another mechanism. It also shows how Coda has been influenced by the work of other researchers and by industry. The article closes with a discussion of the technical and nontechnical lessons that can be learned from the evolution of the system.
