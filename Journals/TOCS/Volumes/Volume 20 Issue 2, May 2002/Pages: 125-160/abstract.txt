A comparative analysis of transaction time-series is made, for light to moderately loaded hosts, motivated by the problem of anomaly detection in computers. Criteria for measuring the statistical state of hosts are examined. Applying a scaling transformation to the measured data, it is found that the distribution of fluctuations about the mean is closely approximated by a steady-state, maximum-entropy distribution, modulated by a periodic variation. The shape of the distribution, under these conditions, depends on the dimensionless ratio of the daily/weekly periodicity and the correlation length of the data. These values are persistent or even invariant. We investigate the limits of these conclusions, and how they might be applied in anomaly detection.
