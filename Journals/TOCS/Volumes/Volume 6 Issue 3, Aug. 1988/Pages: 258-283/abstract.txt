We describe a new communication model for distributed systems that combines the advantages of remote procedure call with the efficient transfer of bulk data. Three ideas form the basis of this model. First, remote procedures are first-class values which can be freely exchanged among nodes, thus enabling a greater variety of protocols to be directly implemented in a remote procedure call framework. Second, a new type of abstract object, called apipe, allows bulk data and incremental results to be efficiently transported in a type-safe manner. Unlike procedure calls, pipe calls do not return values and do not block a caller. Data sent down a pipe is received by the pipe's sink node in the order sent. Third, the relative sequencing of pipes and procedures can be controlled by combining them intochannel groups. Calls on the members of a channel group are guaranteed to be processed in order. Application experience with this model, which we call theChannel Model, is reported. Derived performance bounds and experimental measures demonstratekpipe calls can performmin( 1 + (r/p),k) times faster thankprocedure calls, whereris the total roundtrip remote communication time andpis the procedure execution time.
