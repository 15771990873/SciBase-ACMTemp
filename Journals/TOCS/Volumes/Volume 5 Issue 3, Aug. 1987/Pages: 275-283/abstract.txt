This paper describes the concepts underlying an alternative link-level protocol for broadband local networks. The protocol uses implicit slotting of the contention channel to support larger networks, improve performance, and provide reliable distributed collision recognition without reinforcement. It is designed such that compatible interfaces to existing CSMA/CD-based systems can be provided.
