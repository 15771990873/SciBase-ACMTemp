In large, dynamic, real-time computer systems, it is frequently most cost effective to employ different software performance and reliability techniques at different levels of granularity, at different times, or within different subsystems. These techniques may include regulation of redundancy and resource allocation, multiversion and multipath execution, adjustments of program attributes such as time-out periods and others.The management of software in such systems is a difficult task. Software that may be adapted to meet varying performance and reliability requirements offers a solution. A REal-time Software Adaptation System (RESAS) includes a uniform model of adaptable software and provides the tool necessary for programmers to implement algorithms that choose and enact adaptations in real time.RESAS has been implemented on a testbed consisting of a multiprocessor and an attached workstation, and adaptation algorithms have been developed that address the problem of adapting software to achieve two goals: software execution within specified time constraints and software resiliency with respect to computer hardware failures.
