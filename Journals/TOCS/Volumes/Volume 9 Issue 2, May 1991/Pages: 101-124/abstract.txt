One of the challenging research issues in building high-speed packet-switched networks is how to control the transmission rate of statistical data flows. This paper describes a new traffic control algorithm,VirtualClock, for high-speed network applications. VirtualClock monitors the average transmission rate of statistical data flows and provides every flow with guaranteed throughput and low queueing delay. It provides firewall protection among individual flows, as in a TDM system, while retaining the statistical multiplexing advantages of packet switching. Simulation results show that the VirtualClock algorithm meets all its design goals.
