We show how to significantly improve the mean response time seen by both uploaders and downloaders in peer-to-peer data-sharing systems. Our work is motivated by the observation that response times are largely determined by the performance of the peers serving the requested objects, that is, by the peers in their capacity as servers. With this in mind, we take a close look at thisserver sideof peers, characterizing its workload by collecting and examining an extensive set of traces. Using trace-driven simulation, we demonstrate the promise and potential problems with scheduling policies based on shortest-remaining-processing-time (SRPT), the algorithm known to be optimal for minimizing mean response time. The key challenge to using SRPT in this context is determining request service times. In addressing this challenge, we introduce two new estimators that enablepredictiveSRPT scheduling policies that closely approach the performance of ideal SRPT. We evaluate our approach through extensive single-server and system-level simulation coupled with real Internet deployment and experimentation.
