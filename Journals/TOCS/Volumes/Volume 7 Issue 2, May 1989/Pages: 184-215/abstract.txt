Trace-driven simulation and hardware measurement are the techniques most often used to obtain accurate performance figures for caches. The former requires a large amount of simulation time to evaluate each cache configuration while the latter is restricted to measurements of existing caches. An analytical cache model that uses parameters extracted from address traces of programs can efficiently provide estimates of cache performance and show the effects of varying cache parameters. By representing the factors that affect cache performance, we develop an analytical model that gives miss rates for a given trace as a function of cache size, degree of associativity, block size, subblock size, multiprogramming level, task switch interval, and observation interval. The predicted values closely approximate the results of trace-driven simulations, while requiring only a small fraction of the computation cost.
