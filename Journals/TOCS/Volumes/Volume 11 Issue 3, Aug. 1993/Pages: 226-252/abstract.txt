Next-generation distributed systems will supportcontinuous media(digital audio and video) in the same framework as other data. Many applications that use continuous media need guaranteed end-to-end performance (bounds on throughput and delay). To reliably support these requirements, system components such as CPU schedulers, networks, and file systems must offer performance guarantees. Ametaschedulercoordinates these components, negotiating end-to-end guarantees on behalf of clients. TheCM-resource model, described in this paper, provides a basis for such a metascheduler. It defines a workload parameterization, an abstract interface to resources, and an algorithm for reserving multiple resources. The model uses an economic approach to  dividing end-to-end delay, and it allows system components to “work ahead,” improving the performance of nonreal-time workload.
