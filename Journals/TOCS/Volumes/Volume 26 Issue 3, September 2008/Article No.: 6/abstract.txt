We introduceexternal synchrony, a new model for local file I/O that provides the reliability and simplicity of synchronous I/O, yet also closely approximates the performance of asynchronous I/O. An external observer cannot distinguish the output of a computer with an externally synchronous file system from the output of a computer with a synchronous file system. No application modification is required to use an externally synchronous file system. In fact, application developers can program to the simpler synchronous I/O abstraction and still receive excellent performance. We have implemented an externally synchronous file system for Linux, called xsyncfs. Xsyncfs provides the same durability and ordering-guarantees as those provided by asynchronouslymounted ext3 file system. Yet even for I/O-intensive benchmarks, xsyncfs performance is within 7&percnt; of ext3 mountedasynchronously. Compared to ext3 mounted synchronously, xsyncfs is up to two orders of magnitude faster.
