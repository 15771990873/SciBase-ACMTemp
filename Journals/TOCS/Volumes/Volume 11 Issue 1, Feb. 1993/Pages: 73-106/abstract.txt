Most modern network protocols give adequate support for traditional applications such as file transfer and remote login. Distributed applications, however, have different requirements (e.g., efficient at-most-once remote procedure call even in the face of processor failures). Instead of using ad hoc protocols to meet each of the new requirements, we have designed a new protocol, called the Fast Local Internet Protocol (FLIP), that provides a clean and simple integrated approach to these new requirements. FLIP is an unreliable message protocol that provides both point-to-point communication and multicast communication, and requires almost no network management. Furthermore, by using FLIP we have simplified higher-level protocols such as remote procedure call and group communication, and enhanced support for process migration and security. A prototype implementation of FLIP has been built as part of the new kernel for the Amoeba distributed operating system, and is in daily use. Measurements of its performance are presented.
