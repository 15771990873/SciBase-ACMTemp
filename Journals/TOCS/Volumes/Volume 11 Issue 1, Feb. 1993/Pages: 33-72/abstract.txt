CHAOSarcis an object-based multiprocessor operating system kernel that provides primitives with which programmers may easily construct objects of differing types and object invocations of differing semantics, targeting multiprocessor systems, and real-time applications. The CHAOSarccanguaranteedesired performance and functionality levels of selected computations in real-time applications. Such guarantees can be made despite possible uncertainty in execution environments by allowing programs toadaptin performance and functionality to varying operating conditions. This paper reviews the primitives offered by CHAOSarcand demonstrates how the required elements of the CHAOSarcreal-time kernel are constructed with those primitives.
