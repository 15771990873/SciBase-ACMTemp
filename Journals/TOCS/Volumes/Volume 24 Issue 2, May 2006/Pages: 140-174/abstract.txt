We present several locking synchronization protocols for Pfair-scheduled multiprocessor systems. We focus on two classes of protocols. The first class is only applicable in systems in which all critical sections are short relative to the length of the scheduling quantum. In this case, efficient synchronization can be achieved by ensuring that all locks have been released before tasks are preempted. This is accomplished by exploiting the quantum-based nature of Pfair scheduling, which providesa prioriknowledge of all possible preemption points. The second and more general protocol class is applicable to any system. For this class, we consider the use of a client-server model. We also discuss the viability of inheritance-based protocols in Pfair-scheduled systems.
