This paper describes current work on the design and specification of a multilevel secure distributed system called SNet. It discusses security models in general, the various problems of information flows in SNet, and the abstract and concrete security model components for SNet. It also introduces Lucid as a language for specifying distributed systems. The model components are expressed in Lucid; these Lucid partial specifications are shown to be correct with respect to the formal model, and the two model components are shown to be consistent. The complete functional specification of SNet in Lucid, its implementation in Concurrent Euclid, and the verification of the implementation with respect to the Lucid specification are not discussed.
