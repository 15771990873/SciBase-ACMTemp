End-to-end transport protocols continue to be an active area of research and development involving (1) design and implementation of special-purpose protocols, and (2) reexamination of the design and implementation of general-purpose protocols. This work is motivated by the perceived low bandwidth and high delay, CPU, memory, and other costs of many current general-purpose transport protocol designs and implementations. This paper examines transport protocol mechanisms and implementation issues and argues that general-purpose transport protocols can be effective in a wide range of distributed applications because (1) many of the mechanisms used in the special-purpose protocols can also be used in general-purpose protocol designs and implementations, (2) special-purpose designs have hidden costs, and (3) very special operating system environments, overall system loads, application response times, and interaction patterns are required before general-purpose protocols are the main system performance bottlenecks.
