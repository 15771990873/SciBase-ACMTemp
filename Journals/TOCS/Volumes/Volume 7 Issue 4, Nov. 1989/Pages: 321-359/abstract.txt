The memory coherence problem in designing and implementing a shared virtual memory on loosely coupled multiprocessors is studied in depth. Two classes of algorithms, centralized and distributed, for solving the problem are presented. A prototype shared virtual memory on an Apollo ring based on these algorithms has been implemented. Both theoretical and practical results show that the memory coherence problem can indeed be solved efficiently on a loosely coupled multiprocessor.
