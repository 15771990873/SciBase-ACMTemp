The widespread use of clusters and Web farms has increased the importance of data replication. In this article, we show how to implement consistent and scalable data replication at the middleware level. We do this by combining transactional concurrency control with group communication primitives. The article presents different replication protocols, argues their correctness, describes their implementation as part of a generic middleware, Middle-R, and proves their feasibility with an extensive performance evaluation. The solution proposed is well suited for a variety of applications including Web farms and distributed object platforms.
