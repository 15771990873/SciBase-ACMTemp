This article presents RaWMS, a novel lightweight random membership service for ad hoc networks. The service provides each node with a partial uniformly chosen view of network nodes. Such a membership service is useful, for example, in data dissemination algorithms, lookup and discovery services, peer sampling services, and complete membership construction. The design of RaWMS is based on a novel reverse random walk (RW) sampling technique. The article includes a formal analysis of both the reverse RW sampling technique and RaWMS and verifies it through a detailed simulation study. In addition, RaWMS is compared both analytically and by simulations with a number of other known methods such as flooding and gossip-based techniques.
