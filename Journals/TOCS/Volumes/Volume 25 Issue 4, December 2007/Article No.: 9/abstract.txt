Many real-time systems, such as battery-operated embedded devices, are energy constrained. A common problem for these systems is how to reduce energy consumption in the system as much as possible while still meeting the deadlines; a commonly used power management mechanism by these systems is dynamic voltage scaling (DVS). Usually, the workloads executed by these systems are variable and, more often than not, unpredictable. Because of the unpredictability of the workloads, one cannot guarantee to minimize the energy consumption in the system. However, if the variability of the workloads can be captured by the probability distribution of the computational requirement of each task in the system, it is possible to achieve the goal ofminimizing the expected energy consumptionin the system. In this paper, we investigate DVS schemes that aim at minimizing expected energy consumption for frame-based hard real-time systems. Our investigation considers various DVS strategies (i.e., intra-task DVS, inter-task DVS, and hybrid DVS) and both an ideal system model (i.e., assuming unrestricted continuous frequency, well-defined power-frequency relation, and no speed change overhead) and a realistic system model (i.e., the processor provides a set of discrete speeds, no assumption is made on power-frequency relation, and speed change overhead is considered). The highlights of the investigation are twopracticalDVS schemes: Practical PACE (PPACE) for a single task and Practical Inter-Task DVS (PITDVS2) for general frame-based systems. Evaluation results show that our proposed schemes outperform and achieve significant energy savings over existing schemes.
