Despite the common claim bymashup platformsthat they enable end-users to develop their own software, in practice end-users still don't develop their own mashups, as the highly technical or inexistent user bases of today's mashup platforms testify. The key shortcoming of current platforms is theirgeneral-purposenature, that privileges expressive power over intuitiveness. In our prior work, we have demonstrated that adomain-specificmashup approach, which privileges intuitiveness over expressive power, has much more potential to enableend-user development(EUD). The problem is that developing mashup platforms—domain-specific or not—iscomplexandtime consuming. In addition, domain-specific mashup platforms by their very nature target only a small user basis, that is, the experts of the target domain, which makes their development not sustainable if it is not adequately supported and automated.With this article, we aim to make the development ofcustom, domain-specific mashup platformscost-effective. We describe amashup tool development kit(MDK) that is able toautomatically generatea mashup platform (comprising custom mashup and component description languages and design-time and runtime environments) from a conceptual design and to provision itas a service. We equip the kit with a dedicateddevelopment methodologyand demonstrate the applicability and viability of the approach with the help of two case studies.
