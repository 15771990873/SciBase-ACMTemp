The rise of the software-as-a-service paradigm has led to the development of a new breed of sophisticated, interactive applications often called Web 2.0. While Web applications have become larger and more complex, Web application developers today have little visibility into the end-to-end behavior of their systems. This article presents AjaxScope, a dynamic instrumentation platform that enables cross-user monitoring and just-in-time control of Web application behavior on end-user desktops. AjaxScope is a proxy that performs on-the-fly parsing and instrumentation of JavaScript code as it is sent to usersâ€™ browsers. AjaxScope provides facilities for distributed and adaptive instrumentation in order to reduce the client-side overhead, while giving fine-grained visibility into the code-level behavior of Web applications. We present a variety of policies demonstrating the power of AjaxScope, ranging from simple error reporting and performance profiling to more complex memory leak detection and optimization analyses. We also apply our prototype to analyze the behavior of over 90 Web 2.0 applications and sites that use significant amounts of JavaScript.
