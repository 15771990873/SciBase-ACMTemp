Numerous studies over the past ten years have shown that concern for personal privacy is a major impediment to the growth of e-commerce. These concerns are so serious that most if not all consumer watchdog groups have called for some form of privacy protection for Internet users. In response, many nations around the world, including all European Union nations, Canada, Japan, and Australia, have enacted national legislation establishing mandatory safeguards for personal privacy. However, recent evidence indicates that Web sites might not be adhering to the requirements of this legislation. The goal of this study is to examine the posted privacy policies of Web sites, and compare these statements to the legal mandates under which the Web sites operate. We harvested all available P3P (Platform for Privacy Preferences Protocol) documents from the 100,000 most popular Web sites (over 3,000 full policies, and another 3,000 compact policies). This allows us to undertake an automated analysis of adherence to legal mandates on Web sites that most impact the average Internet user. Our findings show that Web sites generally do not even claim to follow all the privacy-protection mandates in their legal jurisdiction (we do not examine actual practice, only posted policies). Furthermore, this general statement appears to be true for every jurisdiction with privacy laws and any significant number of P3P policies, including European Union nations, Canada, Australia, and Web sites in the USA Safe Harbor program.
