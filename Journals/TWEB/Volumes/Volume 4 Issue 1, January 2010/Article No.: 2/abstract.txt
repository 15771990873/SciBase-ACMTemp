The Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) standardizes the development of composite enterprise applications that make use of software components exposed as Web services. BPEL processes are currently executed by a centralized orchestration engine, in which issues such as scalability, platform heterogeneity, and division across administrative domains can be difficult to manage. We propose a distributed agent-based orchestration engine in which several lightweight agents execute a portion of the original business process and collaborate in order to execute the complete process. The complete set of standard BPEL activities are supported, and the transformations of several BPEL activities to the agent-based architecture are described. Evaluations of an implementation of this architecture demonstrate that agent-based execution scales better than a non-distributed approach, with at least 70&percnt; and 120&percnt; improvements in process execution time, and throughput, respectively, even with a large number of concurrent process instances. In addition, the distributed architecture successfully executes large processes that are shown to be infeasible to execute with a nondistributed engine.
