In the past, enterprise resource planning systems were designed as monolithic software systems running on centralized mainframes. Today, these systems are (re-)designed as a repository of enterprise services that are distributed throughout the available computing infrastructure. These service oriented architectures (SOAs) require advanced automatic and adaptive management concepts in order to achieve a high quality of service level in terms of, for example, availability, responsiveness, and throughput. The adaptive management has to allocate service instances to computing resources, adapt the resource allocation to unforeseen load fluctuations, and intelligently schedule individual requests to guarantee negotiated service level agreements (SLAs). Our AutoGlobe platform provides such a comprehensive adaptive service management comprising—static service-to-server allocation based on automatically detected service utilization patterns,—adaptive service management based on a fuzzy controller that remedies exceptional situations by automatically initiating, for example, service migration, service replication (scale-out), and—adaptive scheduling of individual service requests that prioritizes requests depending on the current degree of service level conformance.All three complementary control components are described in detail, and their effectiveness is analyzed by means of realistic business application scenarios.
