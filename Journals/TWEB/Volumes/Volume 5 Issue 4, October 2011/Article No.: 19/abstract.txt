Todayâ€™s Web provides many different functionalities, including communication, entertainment, social networking, and information retrieval. In this article, we analyze traces of HTTP activity from a large enterprise and from a large university to identify and characterize Web-based service usage. Our work provides an initial methodology for the analysis of Web-based services. While it is nontrivial to identify the classes, instances, and providers for each transaction, our results show that most of the traffic comes from a small subset of providers, which can be classified manually. Furthermore, we assess both qualitatively and quantitatively how the Web has evolved over the past decade, and discuss the implications of these changes.
