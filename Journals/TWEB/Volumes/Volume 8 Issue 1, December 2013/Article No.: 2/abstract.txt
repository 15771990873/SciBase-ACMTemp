In many cases, it is not cost effective to automate business processes which affect a small number of people and/or change frequently. We present a novel approach for enabling domain experts to model and deploy such processes from their respective domain as Web service compositions. The approach builds on user-editable service, naming and representing Web services as forms. On this basis, the approach provides a visual composition language with a targeted restriction of control-flow expressivity, process simulation, automated process verification mechanisms, and code generation for executing orchestrations. A Web-based service composition prototype implements this approach, including a WS-BPEL code generator. A small lab user study with 14 participants showed promising results for the usability of the system, even for nontechnical domain experts.
