Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) provides a flexible framework for service composition. Using standard-based protocols (such as SOAP and WSDL), composite services can be constructed by integrating atomic services developed independently. Algorithms are needed to select service components with various QoS levels according to some application-dependent performance requirements. We design a broker-based architecture to facilitate the selection of QoS-based services. The objective of service selection is to maximize an application-specific utility function under the end-to-end QoS constraints. The problem is modeled in two ways: the combinatorial model and the graph model. The combinatorial model defines the problem as a multidimension multichoice 0-1 knapsack problem (MMKP). The graph model defines the problem as a multiconstraint optimal path (MCOP) problem. Efficient heuristic algorithms for service processes of different composition structures are presented in this article and their performances are studied by simulations. We also compare the pros and cons between the two models.
