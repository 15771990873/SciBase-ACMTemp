It is likely that mobile phones will soon come to rival more traditional devices as the primary platform for information access. Consequently, it is important to understand the emerging information access behavior of mobile Internet (MI) users especially in relation to their use of mobile handsets for information browsing and query-based search. In this article, we describe the results of a recent analysis of the MI habits of more than 600,000 European MI users, with a particular emphasis on the emerging interest in mobile search. We consider a range of factors including whether there are key differences between browsing and search behavior on the MI compared to the Web. We highlight how browsing continues to dominate mobile information access, but go on to show how search is becoming an increasingly popular information access alternative especially in relation to certain types of mobile handsets and information needs. Moreover, we show that sessions involving search tend to be longer and more data-rich than those that do not involve search. We also look at the type of queries used during mobile search and the way that these queries tend to be modified during the course of a mobile search session. Finally we examine the overlap among mobile search queries and the different topics mobile users are interested in.
