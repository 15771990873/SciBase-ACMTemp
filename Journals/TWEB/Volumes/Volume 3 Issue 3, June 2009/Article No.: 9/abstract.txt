The results of an extensive investigation of cookie deployment amongst 100,000 Internet sites are presented. Cookie deployment is found to be approaching universal levels and hence there exists an associated need for relevant Web and software engineering processes, specifically testing strategies which actively consider cookies. The semi-automated investigation demonstrates that over two-thirds of the sites studied deploy cookies. The investigation specifically examines the use of first-party, third-party, sessional, and persistent cookies within Web-based applications, identifying the presence of a P3P policy and dynamic Web technologies as major predictors of cookie usage. The results are juxtaposed with the lack of testing strategies present in the literature. A number of real-world examples, including two case studies are presented, further accentuating the need for comprehensive testing strategies for Web-based applications. The use of antirandom test case generation is explored with respect to the testing issues discussed. Finally, a number of seeding vectors are presented, providing a basis for testing cookies within Web-based applications.
