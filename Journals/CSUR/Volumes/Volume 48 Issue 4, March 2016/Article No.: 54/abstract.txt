Process variation—deviation in parameters from their nominal specifications—threatens to slow down and even pause technological scaling, and mitigation of it is the way to continue the benefits of chip miniaturization. In this article, we present a survey of architectural techniques for managing process variation (PV) in modern processors. We also classify these techniques based on several important parameters to bring out their similarities and differences. The aim of this article is to provide insights to researchers into the state of the art in PV management techniques and motivate them to further improve these techniques for designing PV-resilient processors of tomorrow.
