While Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have been traditionally tasked with single applications, in recent years we have witnessed the emergence of Shared Sensor Networks (SSNs) as integrated cyber-physical system infrastructures for a multitude of applications. Instead of assuming an application-specific network design, SSNs allow the underlying infrastructure to be shared among multiple applications that can potentially belong to different users. On one hand, a potential benefit of such a design approach is to increase the utilization of sensing and communication resources, whenever the underlying network infrastructure covers the same geographic area and the sensor nodes monitor the same physical variables of common interest for different applications. On the other hand, compared with the existing application-specific design, the SSNs approach poses several research challenges with regard to different aspects of WSNs. In this article, we present a systematic literature survey on SSNs. The main goal of the article is to provide the reader with the opportunity to understand what has been done and what remains as open issues in this field, as well as which are the pivotal factors of this evolutionary design and how this kind of design can be exploited by a wide range of WSN applications.
