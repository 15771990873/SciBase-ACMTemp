The demand for more sophisticated Location-Based Services (LBS) in terms of applications variety and accuracy is tripling every year since the emergence of the smartphone a few years ago. Equally, smartphone manufacturers are mounting several wireless communication and localization technologies, inertial sensors as well as powerful processing capability, to cater to such LBS applications. A hybrid of wireless technologies is needed to provide seamless localization solutions and to improve accuracy, to reduce time to fix, and to reduce power consumption. The review of localization techniques/technologies of this emerging field is therefore important. This article reviews the recent research-oriented and commercial localization solutions on smartphones. The focus of this article is on the implementation challenges associated with utilizing these positioning solutions on Android-based smartphones. Furthermore, the taxonomy of smartphone-location techniques is highlighted with a special focus on the detail of each technique and its hybridization. The article compares the indoor localization techniques based on accuracy, utilized wireless technology, overhead, and localization technique used. The pursuit of achieving ubiquitous localization outdoors and indoors for critical LBS applications such as security and safety shall dominate future research efforts.
