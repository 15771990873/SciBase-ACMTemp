LetSbe a set ofnpoints in
â„œd. We present an algorithm that uses the
well-separated pair decomposition and computes the minimum spanning
tree ofSunder anyLpor polyhedral
metric. A theoretical analysis shows that it has an expected
running time ofO(nlogn) for uniform point
distributions; this is verified experimentally. Extensive
experimental results show that this approach is practical. Under a
variety of input distributions, the resulting implementation is
robust and performs well for points in higher dimensional
space.
