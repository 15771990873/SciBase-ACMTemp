We consider the one-sided crossing minimization problem (CP):
given a bipartite graphGand a permutationx0of the vertices on a layer, find a perumuationx1of the vertices on the other layer which
minimizes the number of edge crossings in any straightline drawing
ofGwhere vertices are placed on two parallel lines and
sorted according tox0andx1.
Solving CP represents a fundamental step in the construction of
aesthetically pleasing layouts of heirarchies and directed graphs,
but unfortunately this problem has been proved to be
NP-complete.In this paper we address the strong relation between CP and the
problem of computing minimum feedback arc sets in directed graphs
and we devise a enw approximation algorithm for CP, called PM, that
exploits this dependency. We experimantally and visually compare
the performance of PM with the performance of well-known algorithms
and of recent attractive strategies. Experiments are carried out on
different families of randomly generated graphs, on pathological
instances, and on real test sets. Performance indicators include
both number of edge crossings and running time, as well as
structural measures of the problem instances. We found CP to be a
very interesting and rich problem from a combinatorial point of
view. Our results clearly separate the behavior of the algorithms,
proving the effectiveness of PM on most test sets and showing
tradeoffs between quality of the solutions and running time.
However, if the visual complexity of the drawings is considered, we
found no clear winner. This confirms the importance of optimizing
also other aesthetic criteria such as symmetry, edge length, and
angular resolution.
