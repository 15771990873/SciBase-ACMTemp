We report on the performance evaluation of greedy parsing with a
single step lookahead (which we call flexible Parsing orFPas an alternative to the commonly used greedy parsing (with
no-lookaheads) scheme. Greedy parsing is the basis of most popular
compression programs includingUNIX compressandgzip, however it usually results in far from optimal
parsing/compression with regard to the dictionary construction
scheme in use. Flexible parsing, however, is optimal [MS99], i.e.
partitions any given input to the smallest number of phrases
possible, for dictionary construction schemes which satisfy the
prefix property throughout their execution.We focus on the application ofFPin the context of the
LZW variant of the Lempel-Ziv'78 dictionary construction method
[Wel84, ZL78], which is of considerable practical interest. We
implement two compression algorithms which use (1)FPwith
LZW dictionary (LZW-FP), and (2)FPwith an
alternative flexible dictionary (FPA as introduced in [Hor95]). Our
implementations are based on novel on-line data structures enabling
us to use linear time and space. We test our implementations on a
collection of input sequences which includes textual files, DNA
sequences, medical images, and pseudorandom binary files, and
compare our results with two of the most popular compression
programsUNIX compressandgzip. Our results
demonstrate that flexible parsing is especially useful for
non-textual data, on which it improves over the compression rates
ofcompressandgzipby up to 20% and 35%,
respectively.
