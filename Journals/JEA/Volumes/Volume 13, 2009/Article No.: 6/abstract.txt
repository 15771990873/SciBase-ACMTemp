Broadcasting is an efficient alternative to unicast for delivering popular on-demand media requests. Broadcasting schemes that are based on windows scheduling algorithms provide a way to satisfy all requests with both low bandwidth and low latency.Consider a system ofnpages that need to be scheduled (transmitted) on identical channels an infinite number of times. Time is slotted, and it takes one time slot to transmit each page. In thewindows scheduling problem(WS) each pagei, 1 ≤i≤n, is associated with arequest window wi. In a feasible schedule for WS, pageimust be scheduled at least once in any window ofwitime slots. The objective function is to minimize the number of channels required to schedule all the pages.The main contribution of this paper is the design of a generalbuffer schemefor the windows scheduling problem such thatanyalgorithm for WS follows this scheme. As a result, this scheme can serve as a tool to analyze and/or exhaust all possible WS-algorithms.The buffer scheme is based on modelling the system as a nondeterministic finite state machine in which any directed cycle corresponds to a legal schedule and vice-versa. Since WS is NP-hard, we present some heuristics and pruning-rules for cycle detection that ensure reasonable cycle-search time.By introducing various rules, the buffer scheme can be transformed into deterministic scheduling algorithms. We show that a simple page-selection rule for the buffer scheme provides an optimal schedule to WS for the case where all thewi's have divisible sizes, and other good schedules for some other general cases. By using an exhaustive-search, we prove impossibility results for other important instances.We also show how to extend the buffer scheme to more generalized environments in which (i) pages are arriving and departing on-line, (ii) the window constraint has somejitter, and (iii) different pages might have different lengths.
