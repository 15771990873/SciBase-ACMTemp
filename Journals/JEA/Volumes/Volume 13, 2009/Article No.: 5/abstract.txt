An overlay graph of a given graphG&equals; (V,E) on a subsetSâŠ†Vis a graph with vertex setSand edges corresponding to shortest paths inG. In particular, we consider variations of the multilevel overlay graph used in Schulz et al. [2002] to speed up shortest-path computation. In this work, we follow up and present several vertex selection criteria, along with two general strategies of applying these criteria, to determine a subsetSof a graph's vertices. The main contribution is a systematic experimental study where we investigate the impact of selection criteria and strategies on multilevel overlay graphs and the resulting speed-up achieved for shortest-path computation: Depending on selection strategy and graph type, a centrality index criterion, selection based on planar separators, and vertex degree turned out to perform best.
