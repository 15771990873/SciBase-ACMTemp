This article presents a domain decomposition algorithm for solving constraint satisfactions problems (CSPs). The proposed algorithm relies on a weak form of neighborhood substitutability referred to as directional substitutability. The main idea is that although two values may not be neighborhood substitutable if we consider the whole neighborhood of a given variable, they could be substitutable if we only focus on a part of the neighborhood induced by an orientation of the constraint graph. Directional substitutability provides a mean to decompose value domains into chains of directionally substitutable values that can be attempted simultaneously during search.We report experiments carried out on several binary CSPs which clearly indicate that variations of classical algorithms which exploit directional substitutability often outperform the original algorithms.
