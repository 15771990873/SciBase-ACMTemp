We study the performance of the most practical inversion-sensitive internal sorting algorithms. Experimental results illustrate that adaptive AVL sort consumes the fewest number of comparisons unless the number of inversions is less than 1&percnt;; in such case Splaysort consumes the fewest number of comparisons. On the other hand, the running time of Quicksort is superior unless the number of inversions is less than 1.5&percnt;; in such case Splaysort has the shortest running time. Another interesting result is that although the number of cache misses for the cache-optimal Greedysort algorithm was the least, compared to other adaptive sorting algorithms under investigation, it was outperformed by Quicksort.
