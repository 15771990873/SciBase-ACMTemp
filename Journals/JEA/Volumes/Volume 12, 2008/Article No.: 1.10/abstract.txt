We present a novel graph model and an efficient algorithm for solving the “threshold all against all” problem, which involves searching two strings (with lengthMandN, respectively) for all maximal approximate substring matches of length at leastS, with up toKdifferences. Our algorithm solves the problem in timeO(MNK3), which is a considerable improvement over the previous known bound for this problem. We also provide experimental evidence that, in practice, our algorithm exhibits a better performance than its worst-case running time.
