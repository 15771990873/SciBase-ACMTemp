We have conducted an extensive experimental study on algorithms for fully dynamic transitive closure. We have implemented the recent fully dynamic algorithms by King &lsqb;1999&rsqb;, Roditty &lsqb;2003&rsqb;, Roditty and Zwick &lsqb;2002, 2004&rsqb;, and Demetrescu and Italiano &lsqb;2000, 2005&rsqb; along with several variants and compared them to pseudo fully dynamic and simple-minded algorithms developed in a previous study &lsqb;Frigioni et al. 2001&rsqb;. We tested and compared these implementations on random inputs, synthetic (worst-case) inputs, and on inputs motivated by real-world graphs. Our experiments reveal that some of the dynamic algorithms can really be of practical value in many situations.
