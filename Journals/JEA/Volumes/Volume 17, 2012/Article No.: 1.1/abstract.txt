Natural language is a rich source of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs), with a uniquely structured solution domain. We describe a number of approaches to satisfying the particular case of unordered letter-level constraints, including anagrams, but also relevant to typographical error correction, password security and word puzzles among other fields. We define theanatree, a data structure that can solve many such problems in constant time with respect to the size of the lexicon. The structure represents the lexicon of a language in a format somewhat analogous to a binary decision diagram (BDD) and, as with BDDs, construction heuristics allow the real average-case performance to vastly exceed the theoretical worst case. We compare anatrees and their alternatives empirically, explore the behavior of the construction heuristics, and characterize the tasks for which each is best suited.
