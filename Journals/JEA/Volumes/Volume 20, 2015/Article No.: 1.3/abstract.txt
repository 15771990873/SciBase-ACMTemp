                Guide to Software forDegree Reduction in Labeled Graph Retrieval. Degree reduction is an initial process in a graph retrieval system in which subsequent processes may search for subgraph isomorphism. Subsequent processes
were the subject of Ullmann's articleBit Vector Algorithms..., JEA Vol 15,
No 1, Article 1.6 (January 2011). Software associated with that article overlaps
the present software. See DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1671970.1921702
