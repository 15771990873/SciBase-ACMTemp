In recent years, highly effective hierarchical and goal-directed speed-up techniques for routing in large road networks have been developed. This article makes a systematic study of combinations of such techniques. These combinations turn out to give the best results in many scenarios, including graphs for unit disk graphs, grid networks, and time-expanded timetables. Besides these quantitative results, we obtain general insights for successful combinations.
