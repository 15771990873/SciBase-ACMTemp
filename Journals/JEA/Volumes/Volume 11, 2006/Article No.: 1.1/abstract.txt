We present three algorithms for exact string matching of multiple patterns. Our algorithms are filtering methods, which applyq-grams and bit parallelism. We ran extensive experiments with them and compared them with various versions of earlier algorithms, e.g., different trie implementations of the Aho--Corasick algorithm. All of our algorithms appeared to be substantially faster than earlier solutions for sets of 1,000--10,000 patterns and the good performance of two of them continues to 100,000 patterns. The gain is because of the improved filtering efficiency caused byq-grams.
