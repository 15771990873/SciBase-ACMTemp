We study the minimum enclosing ball (MEB) problem for sets of points or balls in high dimensions. Using techniques of second-order cone programming and "core-sets", we have developed (1 + ε)-approximation algorithms that perform well in practice, especially for very high dimensions, in addition to having provable guarantees. We prove the existence of core-sets of sizeO(1/ε), improving the previous bound ofO(1/ε2), and we study empirically how the core-set size grows with dimension. We show that our algorithm, which is simple to implement, results in fast computation of nearly optimal solutions for point sets in much higher dimension than previously computable using exact techniques.
