We consider the uniform metric labeling problem. This NP-hard problem considers how to assign objects to labels respecting assignment and separation costs. The known approximation algorithms are based on solutions of large linear programs and are impractical for moderate- and large-size instances. We present an 8logn-approximation algorithm that can be applied to large-size instances. The algorithm is greedy and is analyzed by a primal-dual technique. We implemented the presented algorithm and two known approximation algorithms and compared them at randomized instances. The gain of time was considerable with small error ratios. We also show that the analysis is tight, up to a constant factor.
