The Class/Teacher Timetabling Problem (CTTP) deals with the weekly scheduling of encounters between teachers and classes of an educational institution. Since CTTP is a NP-hard problem for nearly all of its variants, the use of heuristic methods for its resolution is justified. This paper presents an efficient Tabu Search (TS) heuristic with two different memory based diversification strategies for CTTP. Results obtained through an application of the method to a set of real world problems show that it produces better solutions than a previously proposed TS found in the literature and faster times are observed in the production of good quality solutions.
