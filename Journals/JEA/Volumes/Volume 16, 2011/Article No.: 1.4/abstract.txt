We experimentally study the problem of assigning applicants to posts. Each applicant provides a preference list, which may contain ties, ranking a subset of the posts. Different optimization criteria may be defined, which depend on the desired solution properties. The main focus of this work is to assess the quality of matchings computed by rank-maximal and popular matching algorithms and compare this with the minimum weight matching algorithm, which is a standard matching algorithm that is used in practice.Both rank-maximal and popular matching algorithms use common algorithmic techniques, which makes them excellent candidates for a running time comparison. Since popular matchings do not always exist, we also study the unpopularity of matchings computed by the aforementioned algorithms. Finally, extra criteria like total weight and cardinality are included, due to their importance in practice. All experiments are performed using structured random instances as well as instances created using real-world datasets.
