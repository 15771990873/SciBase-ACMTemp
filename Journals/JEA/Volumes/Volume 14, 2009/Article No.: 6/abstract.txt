The Metric Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classical NP-hard optimization problem. The double-tree shortcutting method for Metric TSP yields an exponentially-sized space of TSP tours, each of which approximates the optimal solution within, at most, a factor of 2. We consider the problem of finding among these tours the one that gives the closest approximation, that is, theminimum-weight double-tree shortcutting. Burkard et al. gave an algorithm for this problem, running in timeO(n3+ 2dn2) and memoryO(2dn2), wheredis the maximum node degree in the rooted minimum spanning tree. We give an improved algorithm for the case of smalld(including planar Euclidean TSP, wheredâ‰¤ 4), running in timeO(4dn2) and memoryO(4dn). This improvement allows one to solve the problem on much larger instances than previously attempted. Our computational experiments suggest that in terms of the time-quality trade-off, the minimum-weight double-tree shortcutting method provides one of the best existing tour-constructing heuristics.
