In this article, we consider different incremental and hierarchicalk-median algorithms with provable performance guarantees and compare their running times and quality of output solutions on different benchmarkk-median datasets. We determine that the quality of solutions output by these algorithms for all the datasets is much better than their performance guarantees suggest. Since some of the incrementalk-median algorithms require approximate solutions for thek-median problem, we also compare some of the existingk-median algorithms running times and quality of solutions obtained on these datasets.
