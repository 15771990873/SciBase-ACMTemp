We study the problem of finding good alternative routes in road networks. We look for routes that are substantially different from the shortest path, have small stretch, and are locally optimal. We formally define the problem of finding alternative routes with a single via vertex, develop efficient algorithms for it, and evaluate them experimentally. Our algorithms are efficient enough for practical use and compare favorably with previous methods in both speed and solution quality.
