Baker and Bird and Baeza-Yates and Regnier are two of the most efficient and widely used algorithms for exact online two-dimensional pattern matching. Both use the automaton of the Aho-Corasick multiple pattern matching algorithm to locate all the occurrences of a two-dimensional pattern in a two-dimensional input string, a data structure that is considered by many as inefficient, especially when used to process long patterns or data using large alphabet sizes. This article presents variants of the Baker and Bird and the Baeza-Yates and Regnier algorithms that use the data structures of the Set Horspool, Wu-Manber, Set Backward Oracle Matching, and SOG multiple pattern matching algorithms in place of the automaton of Aho-Corasick and evaluates their performance experimentally in terms of preprocessing and searching time.
