The effectiveness of a type-checking tool strongly depends on the accuracy of the positional information that is associated with type errors. We present an approach where the location associated with an error messageeis defined as aslicePeof the programPbeing type-checked. We show that this approach yields highly accurate positional information:Peis a program that contains precisely those program constructs inPthat caused errore. Semantically, we have the interesting property that type-checkingPeis guaranteed to produce the same errore. Our approach is completely language-independent and has been implemented for a significant subset of Pascal. We also report on experiments with object-oriented type systems, and with a subset of ML.
