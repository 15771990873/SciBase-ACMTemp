We present a domain-independent model of hierarchical software system design and construction that is based on interchangeable software components and large-scale reuse. The model unifies the conceptualizations of two independent projects, Genesis and Avoca, that are successful examples of software component/building-block technologies and domain modeling. Building-block technologies exploit large-scale reuse, rely on open architecture software, and elevate the granularity of programming to the subsystem level. Domain modeling formalizes the similarities and differences among systems of a domain. We believe our model is a blueprint for achieving software component technologies in many domains.
