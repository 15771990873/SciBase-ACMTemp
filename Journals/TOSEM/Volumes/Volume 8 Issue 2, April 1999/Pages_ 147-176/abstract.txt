To a great extent, the usefulness of a formal model of a software process lies in its ability to accurately predict the behavior of the executing process. Similarly, the usefulness of an executing process lies largely in its ability to fulfill the requirements embodied in a formal model of the process. When process models and process executions diverge, something significant is happening. We have developed techniques for uncovering and measuring the discrepancies between models and executions, which we callprocess validation. Process validation takes a process execution and a process model, and measures the level of correspondence between the two. Our metrics are tailorable and give process engineers control over determining the severity of different types of  discrepancies. The techniques provide detailed information once a high-level measurement indicates the presence of a problem. We have applied our processes validation methods in an industrial case study, of which a portion is described in this article.
