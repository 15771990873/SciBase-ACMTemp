This article presents a semantic-based environment for reasoning about the behavior of mobile systems. The verification environment, called HAL, exploits a novel automata-like model that allows finite-state verification of systems specified in the Ï€-calculus. The HAL system is able to interface with several efficient toolkits (e.g. model-checkers) to determine whether or not certain properties hold for a given specification. We report experimental results on some case studies.
