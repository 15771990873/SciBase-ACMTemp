This paper describes a system that automatically performs static interprocedural sequencing analysis from programmable constraint specifications. We describe the algorithms used for interprocedural analysis, relate the problems arising from the analysis of real-world programs, and show how these difficulties were overcome. Finally, we sketch the architecture of our prototype analysis system (called Cesar) and describe our experiences to date with its use, citing performance and error detection characteristics.
