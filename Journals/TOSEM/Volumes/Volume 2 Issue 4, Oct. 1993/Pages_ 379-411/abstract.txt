Partial specifications written in many different specification languages can be composed if they are all given semantics in the same domain, or alternatively, all translated into a common style of predicate logic. The common semantic domain must be very general, the particular semantics assigned to each specification language must be conducive to composition, and there must be some means of communication that enables specifications to build on one another. The criteria for success are that a wide variety of specification languages should be accommodated, there should be no restrictions on where boundaries between languages can be placed, and intuitive expectations of the specifier should be met.
