The design of distributed applications in a CORBA-based environment can be carried out by means of an incremental approach, which starts from the specification and leads to the high-level architectural design. This article discusses a methodology to transform a formal specification written in TRIO into a high-level design document written in an extension of TRIO, named TRIO/CORBA (TC). The TC language is suited to formally describe the high-level architecture of a CORBA-based application. As a result, designers are offered high-level concepts that precisely define the architectural elements of an application. Furthermore, TC offers mechanisms to extend its base semantics, and can be adapted to future developments and enhancements in the CORBA standard. The methodology and the associated language are presented through a case study derived from a real Supervision and Control System.
