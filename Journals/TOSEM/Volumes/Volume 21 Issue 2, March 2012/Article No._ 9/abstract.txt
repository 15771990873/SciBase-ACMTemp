Constructing comprehensive operational models of intended system behavior is a complex and costly task, which can be mitigated by the construction of partial behavior models, providing early feedback and subsequently elaborating them iteratively. However, how should partial behavior models with different viewpoints covering different aspects of behavior be composed? How should partial models of component instances of the same type be put together? In this article, we proposemodel mergingof modal transition systems (MTSs) as a solution to these questions. MTS models are a natural extension of labelled transition systems that support explicit modeling of what is currently unknown about system behavior. We formally define model merging based on weak alphabet refinement, which guarantees property preservation, and show that merging consistent models is a process that should result in a minimal common weak alphabet refinement (MCR). In this article, we provide theoretical results and algorithms that support such a process. Finally, because in practice MTS merging is likely to be combined with other operations over MTSs such as parallel composition, we also study the algebraic properties of merging and apply these, together with the algorithms that support MTS merging, in a case study.
