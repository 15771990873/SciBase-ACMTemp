The development of real-time systems is based on a variety of different methods and notations. Despite the purported benefits of formal methods, informal techniques still play a predominant role in current industrial practice. Formal and informal methods have been combined in various ways to smoothly introduce formal methods in industrial practice. The combination ofreal-time structured analysis(SA-RT) withPetri netsis among the most popular approaches, but has been applied only to requirements specifications. This paper extends SA-RT to specifications of the detailed design of embedded real-time systems, and combines the proposed notation with Petri nets.
