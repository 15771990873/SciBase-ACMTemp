Delta algorithms compress data by encoding one file in terms of another. This type of compression is useful in a number of situations: strong multiple versions of data, displaying differences, merging changes, distributing updates, storing backups, transmitting video sequences, and others. This article studies the performance parameters of several delta algorithms, using a benchmark of over 1,300 pairs of files taken from two successive releases of GNU software. Results indicate that modern delta compression algorithms based on Ziv-Lempel techniques significantly outperformdiff, a popular but older delta compressor, in terms of compression ratio. The modern compressors also correlate better with the actual difference between files without sacrificing performance.
