A number of authors have considered the problem of comparing test sets and criteria. Ideally test sets are compared using a preorder with the property that test setT1is at least as strong asT2if wheneverT2determines that an implementationpis faulty,T1will also determine thatpis faulty. This notion can be extended to test criteria. However, it has been noted that very few test sets and criteria are comparable under such an ordering; instead orderings are based on weaker properties such as subsumes. This article explores an alternative approach, in which comparisons are made in the presence of a test hypothesis or fault domain. This approach allows strong statements about fault detecting ability to be made and yet for a number of test sets and criteria to be comparable. It may also drive incremental test generation.
