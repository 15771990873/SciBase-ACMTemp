Goal/Question/Metric GQM) is a paradigm for the systematic definition, establishment, and exploitation of measurement programs supporting the quantitative evaluation of softare processes and products. Although GQM is a quite well-known method, detailed guidelines for establishing a GQM program in an industrial environment are still limited. Also, there are few reported experiences on the application of GQM to industrial cases. Finally, the technological support for GQM is still inadequate. This article describes the experience we have gained in applying GQM at Digital Laboratries in Italy. The procedures, experiences, and technology that have been employed in this study are largely reusable by other industrial organizations willing to introduce a GQM-based measurement program in their  development environments.
