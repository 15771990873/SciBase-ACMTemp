Size estimation plays a key role in effort estimation that has a crucial impact on software projects in the software industry. Some information required by existing software sizing methods is difficult to predict in the early stage of software development. A conceptual data model is widely used in the early stage of requirements analysis for information systems. Lines of code (LOC) is a commonly used software size measure. This article proposes a novel LOC estimation method for information systems from their conceptual data models through using a multiple linear regression model. We have validated the proposed method using samples from both the software industry and open-source systems.
