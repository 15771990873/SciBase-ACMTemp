Dynamic information flow analysis(DIFA) was devised to enable the flow of information among variables in an executing program to be monitored and possibly regulated. It is related to techniques likedynamic slicinganddynamic impact analysis. To better understand the basis for DIFA, we conducted an empirical study in which we measured thestrengthof information flows identified by DIFA, using information theoretic and correlation-based methods. The results indicate that in most cases the occurrence of a chain of dynamic program dependences between two variables doesnotindicate a measurable information flow between them. We also explored the relationship between the strength of an information flow and thelengthof the corresponding dependence chain, and we obtained results indicating that no consistent relationship exists between the length of an information flow and its strength. Finally, we investigated whether data dependence and control dependence makes equal or unequal contributions to flow strength. The results indicate that flows due to data dependences alone are stronger, on average, than flows due to control dependences alone. We present the details of our study and consider the implications of the results for applications of DIFA and related techniques.
