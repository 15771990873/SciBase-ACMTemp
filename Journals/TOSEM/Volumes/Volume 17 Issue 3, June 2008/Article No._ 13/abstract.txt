Background. This article describes a case study on the benefits of software reuse in a large telecom product. The reused components were developed in-house and shared in a product-family approach.Methods. Quantitative data mined from company repositories are combined with other quantitative data and qualitative observations.Results. We observed significantly lower fault density and less modified code between successive releases of the reused components. Reuse and standardization of software architecture and processes allowed easier transfer of development when organizational changes happened.Conclusions. The study adds to the evidence of quality benefits of large-scale reuse programs and explores organizational motivations and outcomes.
