Software engineers must systematically account for the broad scope of environmental behavior, including nonfunctional requirements, intended to coordinate the actions of stakeholders and software systems. The Inquiry Cycle Model (ICM) provides engineers with a strategy to acquire and refine these requirements by having domain experts answer six questions: who, what, where, when, how, and why. Goal-based requirements engineering has led to the formalization of requirements to answer the ICM questions aboutwhen,how, andwhygoals are achieved, maintained, or avoided. In this article, we present a systematic process calledSemantic Parameterizationfor expressing natural language domain descriptions of goals as specifications in description logic. The formalization of goals in description logic allows engineers to automate inquiries usingwho,what, andwherequestions, completing the formalization of the ICM questions. The contributions of this approach include new theory to conceptually compare and disambiguate goal specifications that enables querying goals and organizing goals into specialization hierarchies. The artifacts in the process include a dictionary that aligns the domain lexicon with unique concepts, distinguishing between synonyms and polysemes, and several natural language patterns that aid engineers in mapping common domain descriptions to formal specifications. Semantic Parameterization has been empirically validated in three case studies on policy and regulatory descriptions that govern information systems in the finance and health-care domains.
