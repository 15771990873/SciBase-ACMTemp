This article describes a formal analysis technique, calledconsistency checking, for automatic detection of errors, such as type errors, nondeterminism, missing cases, and circular definitions, in requirements specifications. The technique is designed to analyze requirements specifications expressed in the SCR (Software Cost Reduction) tabular notation. As background, the SCR approach to specifying requirements is reviewed. To provide a formal semantics for the  SCR notation and a foundation for consistency checking, a formal requirements model is introduced; the model represents a software system as a finite-state automation which produces externally visible outputs in response to changes in monitored environmental quantities. Results of two experiments are presented which evaluated the utility and scalability of our technique for consistency checking in real-world avionics application. The role of consistency checking during the requirements phase of software development is discussed.
