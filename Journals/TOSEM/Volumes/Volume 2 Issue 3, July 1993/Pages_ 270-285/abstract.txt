This paper presents a technique to select a representative set of test cases from a test suite that provides the same coverage as the entire test suite. This selection is performed by identifying, and then eliminating, the redundant and obsolete test cases in the test suite. The representative set replaces the original test suite and thus, potentially produces a smaller test suite. The representative set can also be used to identify those test cases that should be rerun to test the program after it has been changed. Our technique is independent of the testing methodology and only requires an association between a testing requirement and the test cases that satisfy the requirement. We illustrate the technique using the data flow testing methodology. The reduction that is possible with our technique is illustrated by experimental results.
