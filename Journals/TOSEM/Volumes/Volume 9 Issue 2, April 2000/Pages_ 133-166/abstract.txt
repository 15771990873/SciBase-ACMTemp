The article presents the SMC system. SMC can be used for checking safety and liveness properties of concurrent programs under different fairness assumptions. It is based on explicit state enumeration. It combats the state explosion by exploiting symmetries of the input concurrent program, usually present in the form of identical processes, in two different ways. Firstly, it reduces the number of explored states by identifying those states that are equivalent under the symmetries of the system; this is calledprocess symmetry. Secondly, it reduces the number of edges explored from each state, in0
 the  reduced state graph, by exploiting the symmetry of a single state; this is calledstate symmetry. SMC works in anon-the-flymanner;  it constructs the reduced state graph as and when it is needed. This method facilitates early termination, speeds up model checking, and reduces memory requirements. We employed SMC to check the correctness of, among other standard examples, the Link Layer part of the IEEE Standard 1394 “Firewire” high-speed serial bus protocol. SMC found deadlocks in the protocol. SMC was also to check certain liveness properties. A report on the case study is included in the article.
