A new approach to software reliability estimation is presented that combines operational testing with stratified sampling in order to reduce the number of program executions that must be checked manually for conformance to requirements. Automatic cluster analysis is applied to execution profiles in order to stratify captured operational executions. Experimental results are reported that suggest this approach can significantly reduce the cost of estimating reliability.
