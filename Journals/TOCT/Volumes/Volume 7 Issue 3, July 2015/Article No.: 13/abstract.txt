We consider the problem of discovering overlapping communities in networks that we model as generalizations of the Set and Graph Packing problems with overlap. As usual for Set Packing problems, we seek a collectionS′&subseteq;Sconsisting of at leastksets subject to certain disjointness restrictions. In ther-Set Packing witht-Membership, each element ofUbelongs to at mosttsets ofS′, while inr-Set Packing witht-Overlap, each pair of sets inS′overlaps in at mosttelements. For both problems, each set ofShas at mostrelements.Similarly, both of our Graph Packing problems seek a collectionKof at leastksubgraphs in a graphG, each isomorphic to a graphH&in;H. InH-Packing witht-Membership, each vertex ofGbelongs to at mosttsubgraphs ofK, while inH-Packing witht-Overlap, each pair of subgraphs inKoverlaps in at mosttvertices. For both problems, each member ofHhas at mostrvertices andmedges, wheret,r, andmare constants.Here, we show NP-completeness results for all of our packing problems. Furthermore, we give a dichotomy result for theH-Packing witht-Membership problem analogous to the Kirkpatrick and Hell dichotomy [Kirkpatrick and Hell 1978]. Using polynomial parameter transformations, we reduce ther-Set Packing witht-Membership to a problem kernel withO((r+ 1)rkr) elements and theH-Packing witht-Membership and its edge version to problem kernels withO((r+ 1)rkr) andO((m+ 1)mkm) vertices, respectively. On the other hand, by generalizing [Fellows et al. 2008; Moser 2009], we achieve a kernel withO(rrkr−t− 1) elements for ther-Set Packing witht-Overlap and kernels withO(rrkr−t− 1) andO(mmkm−t− 1) vertices for theH-Packing witht-Overlap and its edge version, respectively. In all cases,kis the input parameter, whilet,r, andmare constants.
