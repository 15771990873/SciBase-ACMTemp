Alice and Bob want to know if two strings of lengthnare almost equal. That is, do the strings differ onat mostabits? Let 0 &les;a&les;n− 1. We show (1) any deterministic protocol—as well as any error-free quantum protocol (C&ast; version)—for this problem requires at leastn− 2 bits of communication, and (2) a lower bound ofn&sol;2 − 1 for error-freeQ&ast; quantum protocols. We also show the same results for determining if two strings differ inexactlyabits. Our results are obtained by lower-bounding the ranks of the appropriate matrices.
