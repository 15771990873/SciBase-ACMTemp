We define the lower and uppermutual dimensionsmdim(x&colon;y) andMdim(x&colon;y) between any two pointsxandyin Euclidean space. Intuitively, these are the lower and upper densities of the algorithmic information shared byxandy. We show that these quantities satisfy the main desiderata for a satisfactory measure of mutual algorithmic information. Our main theorem, thedata processing inequalityfor mutual dimension, says that iff&colon; Rm→ Rnis computable and Lipschitz, then the inequalitiesmdim(f(x)&colon;y) ≤mdim(x&colon;y) andMdim(f(x)&colon;y) ≤Mdim(x&colon;y) hold for allx∈ Rmandy∈ Rt. We use this inequality and related inequalities that we prove in like fashion to establish conditions under which various classes of computable functions on Euclidean space preserve or otherwise transform mutual dimensions between points.
