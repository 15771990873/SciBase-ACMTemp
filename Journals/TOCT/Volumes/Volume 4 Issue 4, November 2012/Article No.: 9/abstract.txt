The sum of square roots over integers problem is the task of deciding the sign of a nonzero sum,S= ∑i=1nδi· √ai, whereδi∈ {+1, −1} andai’s are positive integers that are upper bounded byN(say). A fundamental open question in numerical analysis and computational geometry is whether &mid;S&mid; ≥ 1/2(n ·log N)O(1)whenS≠ 0. We study a formulation of this problem over polynomials. Given an expressionS= ∑i=1nci· √fi(x), whereci’s belong to a field of characteristic 0 andfi’s are univariate polynomials with degree bounded bydandfi(0)≠0 for alli, is it true that the minimum exponent ofxthat has a nonzero coefficient in the power seriesSis upper bounded by (n·d)O(1), unlessS= 0? We answer this question affirmatively. Further, we show that this result over polynomials can be used to settle (positively) the sum of square roots problem for a special class of integers: Suppose each integeraiis of the form,ai=Xdi+bi1Xdi−1+...+bidi,di> 0, whereXis a positive real number andbij’s are integers. LetB= max ({&mid;bij&mid;}i, j, 1) andd= maxi{di}. IfX> (B+ 1)(n·d)O(1)then a nonzeroS= ∑i=1nδi· √aiis lower bounded as &mid;S&mid; ≥ 1/X(n·d)O(1). The constant inO(1), as fixed by our analysis, is roughly 2.We then consider the following more general problem. Given an arithmetic circuit computing a multivariate polynomialf(X) and integerd, is the degree off(X) less than or equal tod? We give a coRPPP-algorithm for this problem, improving previous results of Allender et al. [2009] and Koiran and Perifel [2007].
