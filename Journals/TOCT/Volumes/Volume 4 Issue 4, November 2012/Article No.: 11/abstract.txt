The Total Influence(Average Sensitivity) of a discrete function is one of its fundamental measures. We study the problem of approximating the total influence of a monotone Boolean function, which we denote byI[f]. We present a randomized algorithm that approximates the influence of such functions to within a multiplicative factor of (1 ±ε) by performingO(√nI[f] poly(1/ε)) queries. We also prove a lower bound ofΩ(√nlogn·I[f]) on the query complexity of any constant factor approximation algorithm for this problem (which holds forI[f]=Ω(1)), hence showing that our algorithm is almost optimal in terms of its dependence onn. For general functions, we give a lower bound ofΩ(nI[f]), which matches the complexity of a simple sampling algorithm.
