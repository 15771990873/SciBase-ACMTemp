We study local filters for two properties of functions of the formf: {0,1}d â†’ R: the Lipschitz property and monotonicity. A local filter with additive errorais a randomized algorithm that is given black-box access to a functionfand a query pointxin the domain off. It outputs a valueF(x) such that (i) thereconstructed functionF(x) satisfies the property (in our case, is Lipschitz or monotone) and (ii) if the input functionfsatisfies the property, then for every pointxin the domain (with high constant probability) the reconstructed valueF(x) differs fromf(x) by at mosta. Local filters were introduced by Saks and Seshadhri [2010]. The relaxed definition we study is due to Bhattacharyya et al. [2012], except that we further relax it by allowing additive error. Local filters for Lipschitz and monotone functions have applications to areas such as data privacy.We show that every local filter for Lipschitz or monotone functions runs in time exponential in the dimensiond, even when the filter is allowed significant additive error. Prior lower bounds (for local filters with no additive error, that is, witha=0) applied only to a more restrictive class of filters, for example,nonadaptivefilters. To prove our lower bounds, we construct families of hard functions and show that lookups of a local filter on these functions are captured by a combinatorial object that we call ac-connector. Then we present a lower bound on the maximum outdegree of ac-connector and show that it implies the desired bounds on the running time of local filters. Our lower bounds, in particular, imply the same bound on the running time for a class of privacy mechanisms.
