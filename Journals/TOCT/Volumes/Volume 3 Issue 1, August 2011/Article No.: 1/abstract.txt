We clarify the role of Kolmogorov complexity in the area of randomness extraction. We show that a computable function is an almost randomness extractor if and only if it is a Kolmogorov complexity extractor, thus establishing a fundamental equivalence between two forms of extraction studied in the literature: Kolmogorov extraction and randomness extraction. We present a distributionMkbased on Kolmogorov complexity that is complete for randomness extraction in the sense that a computable function is an almost randomness extractor if and only if it extracts randomness fromMk.
