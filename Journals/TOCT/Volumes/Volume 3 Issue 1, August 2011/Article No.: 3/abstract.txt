Letf: {0, 1}n→ {0, 1}. Letμbe a product probability measure on {0, 1}n. For&epsi;≥ 0, we defineD&epsi;(f), the&epsi;-approximatedecision tree complexity off, to be the minimum depth of a decision treeTwithμ(T(x) ≠f(x)) ≤&epsi;. Forj= 0 or 1 and forδ≥ 0, we defineCj,δ(f), theδ-approximatej-certificate complexity off, to be the minimum certificate complexity of a setA⊆Ωwithμ(AΔf−1(j)) ≤&epsi;. Note that ifμ(x) > 0 for allxthenD0(f) =D(f) andCj,0(f) =Cj(f) are the ordinary decision tree andj-certificate complexities off, respectively. We extend the well-known result,D(f) ≤C1(f)C0(f) [Blum and Impagliazzo 1987; Hartmanis and Hemachandra 1991; Tardos 1989], proving that for all&epsi;> 0 there exists aδ> 0 and a constantK=K(&epsi;,δ) > 0 such that for alln,μ,f,D&epsi;(f) ≤K C1,δ(f)C0,δ(f). We also give a partial answer to a related question on query complexity raised by Tardos [1989]. We prove generalizations of these results to general product probability spaces.
