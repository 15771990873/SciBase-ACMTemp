In 1997, Håstad showed NP-hardness of (1 − &epsi;, 1&sol;q&plus; δ)-approximating Max-3Lin(Zq); however, it was not until 2007 that Guruswami and Raghavendra were able to show NP-hardness of (1 − &epsi;, δ)-approximating Max-3Lin(Z). In 2004, Khot--Kindler--Mossel--O’Donnell showed UG-hardness of (1 − &epsi;, δ)-approximating Max-2Lin(Zq) forq&equals;q(&epsi;, δ) a sufficiently large constant; however, achieving the same hardness for Max-2Lin(Z) was given as an open problem in Raghavendra’s 2009 thesis. In this work, we show that fairly simple modifications to the proofs of the Max-3Lin(Zq) and Max-2Lin(Zq) results yield optimal hardness results over Z. In fact, we show a kind of “bicriteria” hardness: Even when there is a (1 − &epsi;)-good solution over Z, it is hard for an algorithm to find a δ-good solution over Z, R, or Zmfor anym&ges;q(&epsi;, δ) of the algorithm’s choosing.
