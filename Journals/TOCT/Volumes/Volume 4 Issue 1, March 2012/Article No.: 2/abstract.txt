We study constraint satisfaction problems on the domain {−1, 1}, where the given constraints are homogeneous linear threshold predicates, that is, predicates of the form sgn(w1x1+ &ctdot; +wnxn) for some positive integer weightsw1, ...,wn. Despite their simplicity, current techniques fall short of providing a classification of these predicates in terms of approximability. In fact, it is not easy to guess whether there exists a homogeneous linear threshold predicate that is approximation resistant or not.The focus of this article is to identify and study the approximation curve of a class of threshold predicates that allow for nontrivial approximation. Arguably the simplest such predicate is the majority predicate sgn(x1+ &ctdot; +xn), for which we obtain an almost complete understanding of the asymptotic approximation curve, assuming the Unique Games Conjecture. Our techniques extend to a more general class of “majority-like” predicates and we obtain parallel results for them. In order to classify these predicates, we introduce the notion ofChow-robustnessthat might be of independent interest.
