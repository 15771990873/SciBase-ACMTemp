An algorithm for a constraint satisfaction problem is called robust if it outputs an assignment satisfying at least a (1 −f(ε))-fraction of constraints for each (1 −ε)-satisfiable instance (i.e., such that at most aε-fraction of constraints needs to be removed to make the instance satisfiable), wheref(ε) → 0 asε→ 0. We establish an algebraic framework for analyzing constraint satisfaction problems admitting an efficient robust algorithm with functionsfof a given growth rate. We use this framework to derive hardness results. We also describe three classes of problems admitting an efficient robust algorithm such thatfisO(1/log (1/ε)),O(ε1/k) for somek> 1, andO(ε), respectively. Finally, we give a complete classification of robust satisfiability with a givenffor the Boolean case.
