We give a new upper bound for the Group and Quasigroup Isomorphism problems when the input structures are given explicitly by multiplication tables. We show that these problems can be computed by polynomial size nondeterministic circuits of unbounded fan-in withO(log logn) depth andO(log2n) nondeterministic bits, wherenis the number of group elements. This improves the existing upper bound for the problems. In the previous bound the circuits have bounded fan-in but depthO(log2n) and alsoO(log2n) nondeterministic bits. We then prove that the kind of circuits from our upper bound cannot compute the Parity function. Since Parity is AC0-reducible to Graph Isomorphism, this implies that Graph Isomorphism is strictly harder than Group or Quasigroup Isomorphism under the ordering defined by AC0reductions. We extend this result to the stronger ACC0[p] reduction and its randomized version.
