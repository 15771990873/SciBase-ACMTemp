We highlight the challenge of proving correlation bounds between boolean functions and real-valued polynomials, where any non-boolean output counts against correlation.We prove that real-valued polynomials of degree 1 2 lg2lg2nhave correlation with parity at most zero. Such a result is false for modular and threshold polynomials. Its proof is based on a variant of an anti-concentration result by Costello et al. [2006].
