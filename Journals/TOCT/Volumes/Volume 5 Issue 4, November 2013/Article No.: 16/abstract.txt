We study low-distortion embedding of metric spaces into the line, and more generally, into the shortest path metric of trees, from the parameterized complexity perspective. LetM=M(G) be the shortest path metric of an edge-weighted graphG, with the vertex setV(G) and the edge setE(G), onnvertices. We give the first fixed parameter tractable algorithm that for anunweightedgraph metricMand integerdeither constructs an embedding ofMinto the line with distortion at mostd, or concludes that no such embedding exists. Our algorithm requiresO(nd4(2d+ 1)2d) time which is a significant improvement over the best previous algorithm that runs in timeO(n4d+2dO(1)). Because of its apparent similarity to the notoriously hardBandwidth Minimizationproblem, we find it surprising that this problem turns out to be fixed parameter tractable.We extend our results on embedding unweighted graph metric into the line in two ways. First, we give an algorithm to construct small-distortion embeddings ofweightedgraph metrics. The running time of our algorithm isO(n(dW)4(2d+ 1)2dW), whereWis the largest edge weight of the input graph. To complement this result, we show that the exponential dependence on the maximum edge weight is unavoidable. In particular, we show that deciding whether a weighted graph metricM(G) with maximum weightW< |V(G)| can be embedded into the line with distortion at mostdis NP-complete for every fixed rationald≥ 2. This rules out any possibility of an algorithm with running timeO((nW)h(d)) wherehis a function ofdalone. Second, we consider more general host metrics for which analogous results hold. In particular, we prove that for any treeTwith maximum degreeΔ, embeddingMinto a shortest path metric ofTis fixed parameter tractable, parameterized by (Δ,d).
