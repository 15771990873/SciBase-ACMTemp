For a finite set Γ of Boolean relations, MaxOnesSAT(Γ) and ExactOnesSAT(Γ) are generalized satisfiability problems where every constraint relation is from Γ, and the task is to find a satisfying assignment with at least/exactlykvariables set to 1, respectively. We study the parameterized complexity of these problems, including the question whether they admit polynomial kernels. For MaxOnesSAT(Γ), we give a classification into five different complexity levels: polynomial-time solvable, admits a polynomial kernel, fixed-parameter tractable, solvable in polynomial time for fixedk, and NP-hard already fork&equals; 1. For ExactOnesSAT(Γ), we refine the classification obtained earlier by taking a closer look at the fixed-parameter tractable cases and classifying the sets Γ for which ExactOnesSAT(Γ) admits a polynomial kernel.
