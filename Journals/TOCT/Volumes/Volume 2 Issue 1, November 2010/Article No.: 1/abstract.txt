We study the nondeterministic cell-probe complexity of static data structures. We introducecell-probe proofs(CPP), a proof system for the cell-probe model, which describes verification instead of computation in the cell-probe model. We present a combinatorial characterization of CPP. With this novel tool, we prove the following lower bounds for the nondeterministic cell-probe complexity of static data structures.–There exists a data structure problem with high nondeterministic cell-probe complexity.–For the exact nearest neighbor search (NNS) problem or the partial match problem in high dimensional Hamming space, for any data structure with Poly(n) cells, each of which containsO(nC) bits whereC< 1, the nondeterministic cell-probe complexity is at least Ω(log(d/logn)), wheredis the dimension andnis the number of points in the data set.–For the polynomial evaluation problem ofd-degree polynomial over finite field of size 2kwhered≤ 2k, for any data structure withscells, each of which containsbbits, the nondeterministic cell-probe complexity is at least min ((k/b(d− 1)), (k−log(d−1)/logs)).
