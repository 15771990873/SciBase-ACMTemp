In this work we consider the problem of approximating the number of relevant variables in a function given query access to the function. Since obtaining a multiplicative factor approximation is hard in general, we consider several relaxations of the problem. In particular, we consider a relaxation of the property testing variant of the problem and we consider relaxations in which we have a promise that the function belongs to a certain family of functions (e.g., linear functions). In the former relaxation the task is to distinguish between the case that the number of relevant variables is at mostk, and the case in which it is far from any function in which the number of relevant variables is more than (1 +γ)kfor a parameterγ. We give both upper bounds and almost matching lower bounds for the relaxations we study.
