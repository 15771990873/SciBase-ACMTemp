We study the setting in which the bits of an unknown infinite binary sequencexare revealed sequentially to an observer. We show that very limited assumptions aboutxallow one to make successful predictions about unseen bits ofx. First, we study the problem of successfully predicting a single 0 from among the bits ofx. In our model, we have only one chance to make a prediction, but may do so at a time of our choosing. This model is applicable to a variety of situations in which we want to perform an action of fixed duration, and need to predict a “safe” time-interval to perform it.LettingNtdenote the number of 1s among the firsttbits ofx, we say thatxis “&epsis;-weakly sparse” if lim inf (Nt/t) ≤ &epsiv;. Our main result is a randomized algorithm that, given any &epsiv;-weakly sparse sequencex, predicts a 0 ofxwith success probability as close as desired to 1 - &epsiv;. Thus, we can perform this task with essentially the same success probability as under the much stronger assumption that each bit ofxtakes the value 1 independently with probability &epsiv;.We apply this result to show how to successfully predict a bit (0 or 1) under a broad class of possible assumptions on the sequencex. The assumptions are stated in terms of the behavior of a finite automatonMreading the bits ofx. We also propose and solve a variant of the well-studied “ignorant forecasting” problem. For every &epsiv;>0, we give a randomized forecasting algorithm S&epsiv;that, given sequential access to a binary sequencex, makes a prediction of the form: “Apfraction of the nextNbits will be 1s.” (The algorithm gets to choosep,N, and the time of the prediction.) For any fixed sequencex, the forecast fractionpis accurate to within ±&epsiv; with probability 1 - &epsiv;.
