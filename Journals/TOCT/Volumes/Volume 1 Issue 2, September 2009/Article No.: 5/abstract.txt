We exhibit an explicit functionf: {0, 1}n→{0, 1} that can be computed by a nondeterministic number-on-forehead protocol communicatingO(logn) bits, but that requiresnΩ(1)bits of communication for randomized number-on-forehead protocols withk=δ·lognplayers, for any fixedδ< 1. Recent breakthrough results for the Set-Disjointness function [Lee and Shraibman 2008; Chattopadhyay and Ada 2008] based on the work of Sherstov [2009; 2008a] imply such a separation but only when the number of players isk< loglogn.We also show that for anyk=A·loglognthe above functionfis computable by a small circuit whose depth is constant wheneverAis a (possibly large) constant. Recent results again give such functions but only when the number of players isk< loglogn.
