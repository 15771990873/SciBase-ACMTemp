A classic result due to Håstad established that for every constant&epsiv;> 0, given an overdetermined system of linear equations over a finite field Fqwhere each equation depends on exactly 3 variables and at least a fraction (1 −&epsiv;) of the equations can be satisfied, it is NP-hard to satisfy even a fraction (1/q+ &epsiv;) of the equations.In this work, we prove the analog of Håstad’s result for equations over the integers (as well as the reals). Formally, we prove that for every&epsiv;,δ> 0, given a system of linear equations with integer coefficients where each equation is on 3 variables, it is NP-hard to distinguish between the following two cases: (i) there is an assignment of integer values to the variables that satisfies at least a fraction (1 −&epsiv;) of the equations, and (ii) no assignment even of real values to the variables satisfies more than a fractionδof the equations.
