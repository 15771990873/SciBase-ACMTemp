The following two decision problems capture the complexity of comparing integers or rationals that are succinctly represented in product-of-exponentials notation, or equivalently, via arithmetic circuits using only multiplication and division gates, and integer inputs.Input instance:Four lists of positive integers:a1,...,an∈N+n;b1,...,bn∈N+n;c1,...,cm∈N+m;d1, ...,dm∈N+m;where each of the integers is represented in binary.Problem 1 (equality testing):Decide whethera1b1a2b2&ctdot;anbn=c1d1c2d2&ctdot;cmdm.Problem 2 (inequality testing):Decide whethera1b1a2b2&ctdot;anbn≥c1d1c2d2&ctdot;cmdm.Problem 1 is easily decidable in polynomial time using a simple iterative algorithm. Problem 2 is much harder. We observe that the complexity of Problem 2 is intimately connected to deep conjectures and results in number theory. In particular, if a refined form of theABC conjectureformulated by Baker in 1998 holds, or if the olderLang-Waldschmidt conjecture(formulated in 1978) on linear forms in logarithms holds, then Problem 2 is decidable in P-time (in the standard Turing model of computation). Moreover, it follows from the best available quantitative bounds on linear forms in logarithms, namely, by Baker and Wüstholz [1993] or Matveev [2000], that ifmandnare fixed universal constants then Problem 2 is decidable in P-time (without relying on any conjectures). This latter fact was observed earlier by Shub [1993].We describe one application: P-time maximum probability parsing for arbitrary stochastic context-free grammars (whereε-rules are allowed).
