The field of kernelization studies polynomial-time preprocessing routines for hard problems in the framework of parameterized complexity. In this article, we show that, unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses to its third level, the following parameterized problems do not admit a polynomial-time preprocessing algorithm that reduces the size of an instance to polynomial in the parameter:---Edge Clique Cover, parameterized by the number of cliques, ---Directed Edge/Vertex Multiway Cut, parameterized by the size of the cutset, even in the case of two terminals, ---Edge/Vertex Multicut, parameterized by the size of the cutset, and ---k-Way Cut, parameterized by the size of the cutset.
