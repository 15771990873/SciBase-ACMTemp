If the class TAUT of tautologies of propositional logic has no almost optimal algorithm, then every algorithm A deciding TAUT has a hard sequence, that is, a polynomial time computable sequence witnessing that A is not almost optimal. We show that this result extends to every Πtp-complete problem witht≥1; however, assuming the Measure Hypothesis, there is a problem which has no almost optimal algorithm but is decided by an algorithm without hard sequences. For problemsQwith an almost optimal algorithm, we analyze whether every algorithm decidingQ, which is not almost optimal, has a hard sequence.
