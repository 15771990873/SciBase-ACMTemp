We introduce a concept of parameterizing a problem above the optimum solution of its natural linear programming relaxation and prove that thenode multiway cutproblem is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) in this setting. As a consequence we prove that node multiway cut is FPT, when parameterized above the maximum separating cut, resolving an open problem of Razgon.Our results implyO&ast;(4k) algorithms for vertex cover above maximum matching and almost 2-SAT as well as anO&ast;(2k) algorithm for node multiway cut with a standard parameterization by the solution size, improving previous bounds for these problems.
