We formulate a notion of evolvability for functions with domain and range that are real-valued vectors, a compelling way of expressing many natural biological processes. We show that linear and fixed-degree polynomial functions are evolvable in the following dually-robust sense: There is a single evolution algorithm that, for all convex loss functions, converges for all distributions.It is possible that such dually-robust results can be achieved by simpler and more-natural evolution algorithms. Towards this end, we introduce a simple and natural algorithm that we callwide-scale random noiseand prove a corresponding result for theL2metric. We conjecture that the algorithm works for a more general class of metrics.
