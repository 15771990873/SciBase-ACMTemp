We study the online decision problem in which the set of available actions varies over time, also called thesleepingexpertsproblem. We consider the setting in which the performance comparison is made with respect to thebestorderingof actions in hindsight. In this article, both the payoff function and the availability of actions are adversarial. Kleinberg et al. [2010] gave a computationally efficient no-regret algorithm in the setting in which payoffs are stochastic. Kanade et al. [2009] gave an efficient no-regret algorithm in the setting in which action availability is stochastic.However, the question of whether there exists acomputationallyefficientno-regret algorithm in the adversarial setting was posed as an open problem by Kleinberg et al. [2010]. We show that such an algorithm would imply an algorithm for PAC learningDNF, a long-standing important open problem. We also consider the setting in which the number of available actions is restricted and study its relation to agnostic-learning monotone disjunctions over examples with bounded Hamming weight.
