This article studies the effective convergence of numerical solutions of initial value problems (IVPs) for ordinary differential equations (ODEs). A convergent sequence {Ym} of numerical solutions is said to be effectively convergent to the exact solution if there is an algorithm that computes anN∈ &Nopf;, given an arbitraryn∈ &Nopf; as input, such that the error betweenYmand the exact solution is less than 2-nfor allm≥N. It is proved that there are convergent numerical solutions generated from Euler’s method which are not effectively convergent. It is also shown that a theoretically-proved-computable solution using Picard’s iteration method might not be computable by classical numerical methods, which suggests that sometimes there is a gap between theoretical computability and practical numerical computations concerning solutions of ODEs. Moreover, it is noted that the main theorem (Theorem 4.1) provides an example of an IVP with a nonuniform Lipschitz function for which the numerical solutions generated by Euler’s method are still convergent.
