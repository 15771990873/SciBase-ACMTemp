We study lower bounds for Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) in the strongest setting: point sets in {0,1}dunder the Hamming distance. Recall that H is said to be an (r,cr,p,q)-sensitive hash family if all pairsx,y∈ {0,1}dwith dist(x,y) ≤rhave probability at leastpof collision under a randomly chosenh∈ H, whereas all pairsx,y∈ {0, 1}dwith dist(x,y) ≥crhave probability at mostqof collision. Typically, one considersd→ ∞, withc> 1 fixed andqbounded away from 0.For its applications to approximate nearest-neighbor search in high dimensions, the quality of an LSH family H is governed by how small itsρparameterρ= ln(1/p)/ln(1/q) is as a function of the parameterc. The seminal paper of Indyk and Motwani [1998] showed that for eachc≥ 1, the extremely simple family H = {x↦xi:i∈ [d]} achievesρ≤ 1/c. The only known lower bound, due to Motwani et al. [2007], is thatρmust be at least (e1/c- 1)/(e1/c+ 1) ≥ .46/c(minusod(1)). The contribution of this article is twofold. (1) We show the “optimal” lower bound forρ: it must be at least 1/c(minusod(1)). Our proof is very simple, following almost immediately from the observation that the noise stability of a boolean function at timetis a log-convex function oft. (2) We raise and discuss the following issue: neither the application of LSH to nearest-neighbor search nor the known LSH lower bounds hold as stated if theqparameter is tiny. Here, “tiny” meansq= 2-Θ(d), a parameter range we believe is natural.
