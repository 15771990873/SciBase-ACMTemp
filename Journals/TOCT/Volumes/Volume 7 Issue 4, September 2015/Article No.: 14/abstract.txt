LetFbe a family of graphs. In theF-Completionproblem, we are given ann-vertex graphGand an integerkas input, and asked whether at mostkedges can be added toGso that the resulting graph does not contain a graph fromFas an induced subgraph. It was shown recently that two special cases ofF-Completion, namely, (i) the problem of completing into a chordal graph known as MinimumFill-in(SIAM J. Comput. 2013), which corresponds to the case ofF&equals;{C4,C5,C6, &ldots;}, and (ii) the problem of completing into a split graph (Algorithmica 2015), that is, the case ofF&equals;{C4, 2K2,C5}, are solvable in parameterized subexponential time 2O(&surd;k&log;k)nO(1). The exploration of this phenomenon is the main motivation for our research onF-Completion.In this article, we prove that completions into several well-studied classes of graphs without long induced cycles and paths also admit parameterized subexponential time algorithms by showing that:—The problem TriviallyPerfectCompletion, which isF-CompletionforF&equals;{C4,P4}, a cycle and a path on four vertices, is solvable in parameterized subexponential time 2O(&surd;klogk)nO(1).—The problems known in the literature as PseudosplitCompletion, the case in which F{2K2,C4}, and ThresholdCompletion, in whichF&equals;2K2,P4,C4}, are also solvable in time 2O(&surd;klogk)nO}(1).We complement our algorithms forF-Completionwith the following lower bounds:—ForF&equals;{2K2},F&equals; {C4},F&equals;{Po4}, andF&equals;{2K2,P4},F-Completioncannot be solved in time 2o(k)nO(1)unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) fails.Our upper and lower bounds provide a complete picture of the subexponential parameterized complexity ofF-Completionproblems for anyF⊆ {2K2,C4,P4}.
