Although the interest of a Web page is strictly related to its content and to the subjective readers' cultural background, a measure of the page authority can be provided that only depends on the topological structure of the Web. PageRank is a noticeable way to attach a score to Web pages on the basis of the Web connectivity. In this article, we look inside PageRank to disclose its fundamental properties concerning stability, complexity of computational scheme, and critical role of parameters involved in the computation. Moreover, we introduce a circuit analysis that allows us to understand the distribution of the page score, the way different Web communities interact each other, the role of dangling pages (pages with no outlinks), and the secrets for promotion of Web pages.
