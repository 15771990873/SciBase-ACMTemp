The explosive growth and the widespread accessibility of the Web has led to a surge of research activity in the area of information retrieval on the World Wide Web. The seminal papers of Kleinberg [1998, 1999] and Brin and Page [1998] introducedLink Analysis Ranking, where hyperlink structures are used to determine the relativeauthorityof a Web page and produce improved algorithms for the ranking of Web search results. In this article we work within the hubs and authorities framework defined by Kleinberg and we propose new families of algorithms. Two of the algorithms we propose use a Bayesian approach, as opposed to the usual algebraic and graph theoretic approaches. We also introduce a theoretical framework for the study of Link Analysis Ranking algorithms. The framework allows for the definition of specific properties of Link Analysis Ranking algorithms, as well as for comparing different algorithms. We study the properties of the algorithms that we define, and we provide an axiomatic characterization of the INDEGREE heuristic which ranks each node according to the number of incoming links. We conclude the article with an extensive experimental evaluation. We study the quality of the algorithms, and we examine how different structures in the graphs affect their performance.
