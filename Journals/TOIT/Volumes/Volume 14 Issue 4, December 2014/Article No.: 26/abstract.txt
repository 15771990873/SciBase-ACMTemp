We here investigate the potential of participatory sensor networks derived from location sharing systems, such as Foursquare, to understand the human dynamics of cities. We propose the City Image visualization technique, which builds a transition graph mapping people's movements between location categories, and demonstrate its use to identify similarities and differences of human dynamics across cities by clustering cities according to their citizens' routines. We also analyze centrality metrics of the transition graphs built for different cities, considering transitions between specific venues. We show that these metrics complement the City Image technique, contributing to a deeper understanding of city dynamics.
