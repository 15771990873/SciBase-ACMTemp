As organizations increasingly operate, compete, and cooperate in a global context, business processes are also becoming global to propagate the benefits from coordination and standardization across geographical boundaries. In this context, security has gained significance due to increased threats, as well as legislation and compliance issues. This article presents a framework for assessing the security of Internet technology components that support a globally distributed workplace. Four distinct information flow and design architectures are identified based on location sensitivities and placements of the infrastructure components. Using a combination of scenarios, architectures, and technologies, the article presents the framework of a development tool for information security officers to evaluate the security posture of an information system. To aid managers in better understanding their options to improve security of the system, we also propose a three-dimensional representation, based on the framework, for embedding solution alternatives. To demonstrate its use in a real-world context, the article also applies the framework to assess a globally distributed workforce application at a northeast financial institution.
