Service discovery and service aggregation are two crucial issues in the emerging area of service-oriented computing (SOC). We propose a new technique for the discovery of (Web) services that accounts for the need of composing several services to satisfy a client query. The proposed algorithm makes use of OWL-S ontologies, and explicitly returns the sequence of atomic process invocations that the client must perform in order to achieve the desired result. When no full match is possible, the algorithm features a flexible matching by returning partial matches and by suggesting additional inputs that would produce a full match.
