As a "social protocol" aimed at providing a technological means to address concerns over Internet privacy, the Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) has been controversial since its announcement in 1997. In the U.S., critics have decried P3P as an industry attempt to avoid meaningful privacy legislation, while developers have portrayed the proposal as a tool for helping users make informed decisions about the impact of their Web surfing choices. This dispute touches upon the privacy model underlying P3P, the U.S. political context regarding privacy, and the technical components of the protocol. This article presents an examination of these factors, with an eye towards distilling lessons for developers of future social protocols.
