In this article, we investigate a first step towards the long-term vision of the Semantic Web by studying the problem of answering queries posed through a mediated ontology to multiple information sources whose content is described asviewsover the ontology relations. The contributions of this paper are twofold. We first offer a uniform logical setting which allows us to encompass and to relate the existing work on answering and rewriting queries using views. In particular, we make clearer the connection between the problem of rewriting queries using views and the problem of answering queries using extensions of views. Then we focus on an instance of the problem of rewritingconjunctive queriesusing views through an ontology expressed in a description logic, for which we exhibit a complete algorithm.
