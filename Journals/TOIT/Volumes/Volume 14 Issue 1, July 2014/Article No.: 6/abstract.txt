With the proliferation of mobile devices and sensors, complex event proceesing (CEP) is becoming increasingly important to scalably detect situations in real time. Current CEP systems are not capable of dealing efficiently with highly dynamic mobile consumers whose interests change with their location. We introduce the distributed mobile CEP (MCEP) system which automatically adapts the processing of events according to a consumer's location. MCEP significantly reduces latency, network utilization, and processing overhead by providing on-demand and opportunistic adaptation algorithms to dynamically assign event streams and computing resources to operators of the MCEP system.
