In this article, we propose a Statistical Cloud-Assisted Reputation Estimation (sCARE) approach for service-oriented environments in uncertain situations. sCARE uses the ratings from cooperating service consumers to uniformly describe the randomness and fuzziness of the different submitted ratings and their associated relationships in quantitative terms. We also define discriminant functions to model the honesty (or lack thereof) of the service raters. Experiment results show that our proposed model performs in a fairly accurate manner for a number of real-world scenarios. A comparison study with similar existing works is also provided to asses sCAREâ€™s performance.
