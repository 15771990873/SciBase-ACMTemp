We model the design and impact of Internet pricing plans with data caps. We consider a monopoly ISP that maximizes its profit by setting tier prices, tier rates, network capacity, data caps, and overage charges. We show that when data caps are used to maximize profit, a monopoly ISP will keep the basic tier price the same, increase the premium tier rate, and decrease the premium tier price and the basic tier rate. We give analytical and numerical results to illustrate the increase in ISP profit, and the corresponding changes in user tier choices, user surplus, and social welfare.
