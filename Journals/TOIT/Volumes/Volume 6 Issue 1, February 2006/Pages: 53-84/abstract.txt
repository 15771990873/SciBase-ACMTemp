Managing multiple versions of XML documents represents a critical requirement for many applications. Recently, there has been much work on supporting complex queries on XML data (e.g., regular path expressions, structural projections, etc.). In this article, we examine the problem of implementing efficiently such complex queries on multiversion XML documents. Our approach relies on a numbering scheme, whereby durable node numbers (DNNs) are used to preserve the order among the nodes of the XML tree while remaining invariant with respect to updates. Using the document's DNNs, we show that many complex queries are reduced to combinations ofrange version retrievalqueries. We thus examine three alternative storage organizations/indexing schemes to efficiently evaluate range version retrieval queries in this environment. A thorough performance analysis is then presented to reveal the advantages of each scheme.
