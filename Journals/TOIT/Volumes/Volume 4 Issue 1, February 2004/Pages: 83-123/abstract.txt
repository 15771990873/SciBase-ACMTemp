An open (in the sense of extensible and programmable) architecture for IP telecommunications must be based on a comprehensive strategy for managing feature interaction. We describe our experience with BoxOS, an IP telecommunication platform that implements the DFC technology for feature composition. We present solutions to problems, common to all efforts in IP telecommunications, of feature distribution, interoperability, and media management. We also explain how BoxOS addresses many deficiencies in SIP, including how BoxOS can be used as a SIP application server.
