OpenID and OAuth are open and simple Web SSO protocols that have been adopted by major service providers, and millions of supporting Web sites. However, the average user’s perception of Web SSO is still poorly understood. Through several user studies, this work investigates users’ perceptions and concerns when using Web SSO for authentication. We found that our participants had several misconceptions and concerns that impeded their adoption. This ranged from their inadequate mental models of Web SSO, to their concerns about personal data exposure, and a reduction in perceived Web SSO value due to the employment of password management practices. Informed by our findings, we offer a Web SSO technology acceptance model, and suggest design improvements.
