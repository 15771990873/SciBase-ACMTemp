Many projects have tried to analyze the structure and dynamics of application overlay networks on the Internet using packet analysis and network flow data. While such analysis is essential for a variety of network management and security tasks, it is infeasible on many networks: either the volume of data is so large as to make packet inspection intractable, or privacy concerns forbid packet capture and require the dissociation of network flows from usersâ€™ actual IP addresses. Our analytical framework permits useful analysis of network usage patterns even under circumstances where the only available source of data is anonymized flow records. Using this data, we are able to uncover distributions and scaling relations in host-to-host networks that bear implications for capacity planning and network application design. We also show how to classify network applications based entirely on topological properties of their overlay networks, yielding a taxonomy that allows us to accurately identify the functions of unknown applications. We repeat this analysis on a more recent dataset, allowing us to demonstrate that the aggregate behavior of users is remarkably stable even as the population changes.
