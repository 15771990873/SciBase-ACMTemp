This article presents a Web content adaptation and delivery mechanism based on application-level quality of service (QoS) policies. To realize effective Web content delivery for users, two kinds of application-level QoS policies, transmission time and transmission order of inline objects, are introduced. Next, we define a language to specify these policies. We show that transmission order control can be implemented using HTTP/1.1 pipelined requests in which a client recognizes the transmission order description in a Web page and simulates parallel transmission of inline objects by HTTP/1.1 range requests. Experimental results show that our proposed mechanism realizes effective content delivery to a diverse group of Internet users. Finally, we introduce two methods to specify application-level QoS policies, one by content authors, and the other by end users.
