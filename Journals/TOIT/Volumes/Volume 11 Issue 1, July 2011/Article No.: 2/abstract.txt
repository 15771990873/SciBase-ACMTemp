There is a continuous struggle for control of resources at every organization that is connected to the Internet. The local organization wishes to use its resources to achieve strategic goals. Some external entities seek direct control of these resources, for purposes such as spamming or launching denial-of-service attacks. Other external entities seek indirect control of assets (e.g., users, finances), but provide services in exchange for them.Using a year-long trace from an edge network, we examine what various external organizations know about one organization. We compare the types of information exposed by or to external organizations using either active (reconnaissance) or passive (surveillance) techniques. We also explore the direct and indirect control external entities have on local IT resources.
