This article presents a publishing system for efficiently creating dynamic Web content. Complex Web pages are constructed from simpler fragments. Fragments may recursively embed other fragments. Relationships between Web pages and fragments are represented by object dependence graphs. We present algorithms for efficiently detecting and updating Web pages affected after one or more fragments change. We also present algorithms for publishing sets of Web pages consistently; different algorithms are used depending upon the consistency requirements.Our publishing system provides an easy method for Web site designers to specify and modify inclusion relationships among Web pages and fragments. Users can update content on multiple Web pages by modifying a template. The system then automatically updates all Web pages affected by the change. Our system accommodates both content that must be proofread before publication and is typically from humans as well as content that has to be published immediately and is typically from automated feeds.We discuss some of our experiences with real deployments of our system as well as its performance. We also quantitatively present characteristics of fragments used at a major deployment of our publishing system including fragment sizes, update frequencies, and inclusion relationships.
