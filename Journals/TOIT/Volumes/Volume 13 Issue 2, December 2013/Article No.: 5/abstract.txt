Server-side authenticated key-establishment protocols are characterized by placing a heavy workload on the server. We propose LAKE: a new protocol that enables amortizing serversâ€™ workload peaks by moving most of the computational burden to the clients. We provide a formal analysis of the LAKE protocol under the Canetti-Krawczyk model and prove it to be secure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most computationally efficient authenticated key-establishment ever proposed in the literature.
