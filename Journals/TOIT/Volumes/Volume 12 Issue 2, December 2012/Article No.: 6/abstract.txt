Keyword query is a user-friendly mechanism for retrieving useful information from XML data in Web and scientific applications. Inspired by the performance benefits of exploiting materialized views when processing structured queries, we investigate the feasibility and present a general framework for answering XML keyword queries using materialized views. Then we develop an XML keyword search engine that leverages materialized views for query evaluation and maintains materialized views incrementally upon XML data update. Experimental evaluation demonstrates the significance and efficiency of our approach.
