Building Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) applications today is a complex, repetitive, and error-prone endeavor, as IaaS does not provide abstractions on top of virtual machines. This article presents JCloudScale, a Java-based middleware for moving elastic applications to IaaS clouds, with minimal adjustments to the application code. We discuss the architecture and technical features, as well as evaluate our system with regard to user acceptance and performance overhead. Our user study reveals that JCloudScaleallows many participants to build IaaS applications more efficiently, compared to industrial Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solutions. Additionally, unlike PaaS, JCloudScaledoes not lead to a control loss and vendor lock-in.
