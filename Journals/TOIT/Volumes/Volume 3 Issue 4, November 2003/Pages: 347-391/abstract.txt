Fundamental to the design of reliable, high-performance network services is an understanding of the performance characteristics of the service as perceived by the client population as a whole. Understanding and measuring such end-to-end service performance is a challenging task. Current techniques include periodic sampling of service characteristics from strategic locations in the network and instrumenting Web pages with code that reports client-perceived latency back to a performance server. Limitations to these approaches include potentially nonrepresentative access patterns in the first case and determining the location of a performance bottleneck in the second.This paper presents EtE monitor, a novel approach to measuring Web site performance. Our system passively collects packet traces from a server site to determine service performance characteristics. We introduce a two-pass heuristic and a statistical filtering mechanism to accurately reconstruct different client page accesses and to measure performance characteristics integrated across all client accesses. Relative to existing approaches, EtE monitor offers the following benefits: i) a latency breakdown between the network and server overhead of retrieving a Web page, ii) longitudinal information for all client accesses, not just the subset probed by a third party, iii) characteristics of accesses that are aborted by clients, iv) an understanding of the performance breakdown of accesses to dynamic, multitiered services, and v) quantification of the benefits of network and browser caches on server performance. Our initial implementation and performance analysis across three different commercial Web sites confirm the utility of our approach.
