The Internet in its present form does not protect content from censorship. It is straightforward to trace any document back to a specific Web server, and usually directly to an individual. As we discuss below, there are valid reasons for publishing a document in a censorship-resistant manner. Unfortunately, few tools exist that facilitate this form of publishing. We describe the architecture of robust systems for publishing content on the Web. The discussion is in the context of Publius, as that system meets the most design goals of currently deployed systems. Publius has the property that it is very difficult for any adversary to censor or modify the content. In addition, the identity of the publisher is protected once the content is posted. The system differs from others in that tools are provided for updating or deleting published content, and users can browse the content in the normal point-and-click manner using a standard Web browser and a client-side proxy.
