The emergence of query-based online data services and e-commerce applications has prompted much recent research on data caching. This article studiessemantic caching, a caching architecture for such applications, that caches the results of selection queries. The primary contribution of this article is to revisit the performance and overhead of semantic caching using a modern database server and modern hardware. Initially, the performance study focuses on simple workloads and demonstrates several benefits of semantic caching, including low overhead, insensitivity to the physical layout of the database, reduced network traffic, and the ability to answer some queries without contacting the server. With moderately complex workloads, careful coding of remainder queries is required to maintain efficient query processing at the server. Using very complex workloads, we demonstrate that semantic caching works well in a range of applications, especially in network-constrained environments.
