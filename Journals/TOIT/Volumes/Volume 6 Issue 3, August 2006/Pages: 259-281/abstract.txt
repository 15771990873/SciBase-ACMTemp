The Globe Distribution Network (GDN) is an application for the efficient, worldwide distribution of freely redistributable software packages. Distribution is made efficient by encapsulating the software into special distributed objects which efficiently replicate themselves near to the downloading clients. The Globe Distribution Network takes a novel, optimistic approach to stop the illegal distribution of copyrighted and illicit material via the network. Instead of having moderators check the packages at upload time, illegal content is removed and its uploader's access to the network permanently revoked only when the violation is discovered. Other protective measures defend the GDN against internal and external attacks to its availability. By exploiting the replication of the software and using fault-tolerant server software, the Globe Distribution Network achieves high availability. A prototype implementation of the GDN is available from http://www.cs.vu.nl/globe/.
