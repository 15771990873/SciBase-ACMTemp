Interacting with touch screen-based computing devices can be difficult for individuals with mobility impairments that affect their hands, arms, neck, or head. These problems may be especially difficult for power wheelchair users, as the frame of their wheelchair may obstruct the users’ range of motion and reduce their ability to reach objects in the environment. The concept of “chairable” input devices refers to input devices that are designed to fit with the form of an individual's wheelchair, much like wearable technology fits with an individual's clothing. In this paper, we introduce a new family of chairable input devices: Gest-Rests. A Gest-Rest is a gesture based input device that fits over a standard power wheelchair armrest. A Gest-Rest enables users to perform traditional touch screen gestures, such as press and flick, as well as pressure-based gestures such as squeezing and punching. We have developed the Gest-Rest Family, a suite of armrest-based input devices designed for power wheelchair users. In this paper, we present formative evaluations of these prototypes with wheelchair users and therapists and present their opinions of this new integrated input technology. Our results show the benefits of armrest-based input devices as well as a comparison of physical switches, force sensing, and capacitive input for individuals with limited dexterity.
