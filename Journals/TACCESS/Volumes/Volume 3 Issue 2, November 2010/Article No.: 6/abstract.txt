Orientation and position information are vital for people with visual impairments if they are to avoid obstacles and hazards while walking around. We develop and evaluate a haptic direction indicator that delivers directional information in real time through kinesthetic cues. The indicator uses a novel kinesthetic perception method called the pseudo-attraction force technique, which employs the nonlinear relationship between perceived and physical acceleration to generate a force sensation. In an experiment, we find that the haptic direction indicator allowed people with visual impairments to walk safely along a predefined route at their usual walking pace without any previous training, independent of the existence of auditory information. The findings indicate that the haptic direction indicator is effective at delivering simple navigational information, and is a suitable substitute for and/or enhancement to conventional wayfinding methods.
