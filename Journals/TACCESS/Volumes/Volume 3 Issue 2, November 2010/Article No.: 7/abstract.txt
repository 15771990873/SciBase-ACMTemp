This work presents an evaluative study on the usability of a haptic device together with a sound-based video game for the development and use of orientation and mobility (O&M;) skills in closed, unfamiliar spaces by blind, school-aged children. A usability evaluation was implemented for a haptic device especially designed for this study (Digital Clock Carpet) and a 3D video game (MOVA3D) in order to determine the degree to which the user accepted the device, and the level of the userâ€™s satisfaction regarding her interaction with these products for O&M; purposes. In addition, a cognitive evaluation was administered. The results show that both the haptic device and the video game are usable, accepted and considered to be pleasant for use by blind children. The results also show that they are ready to be used for cognitive learning purposes. Results from a cognitive study demonstrated significant gains in tempo-spatial orientation skills of blind children when navigating in unfamiliar spaces.
