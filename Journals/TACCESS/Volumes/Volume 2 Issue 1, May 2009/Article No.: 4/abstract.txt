The increasing permeation of technology in our society leads to the challenge that everybody needs to interact with technology systems. Older adults often meet difficulties while trying to interact with complex, demanding systems in their daily life. One approach to enable older adults to use new technologies in a safe and efficient way is the provision of training programs. In this article we report about a promising training strategy using video modeling in conjunction with other instructional methods to enhance learning. Cognitive as well as socio-motivational aspects will be addressed. We assessed if guided error training in video modeling will improve learning outcomes for a Ticket Vending Machine (TVM). To investigate if the training method might be beneficial for younger adults as well, we compared 40 younger and 40 older adult learners in a guided error training course with error-free training. Younger and older participants made fewer mistakes in guided error training, but no differences occurred in task completion times. Moreover, self-efficacy increased with training for both age groups, but no significant differences were found for the training condition. Analysis of knowledge gains showed a significant benefit of guided error training in structural knowledge. Overall, the results showed that guided error training may enhance learning for younger and older adults who are learning to use technology.
