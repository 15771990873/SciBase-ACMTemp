The ability to use the movements of the eyes to write is extremely important for individuals with a severe motor disability. With eye typing, a virtual keyboard is shown on the screen and the user enters text by gazing at the intended keys one at a time. With dwell-based eye typing, a key is selected by continuously gazing at it for a specific amount of time. However, this approach has two possible drawbacks: unwanted selections and slow typing rates. In this study, we propose a dwell-free eye typing technique that filters out unintentionally selected letters from the sequence of letters looked at by the user. It ranks possible words based on their length and frequency of use and suggests them to the user. We evaluated Filteryedping with a series of experiments. First, we recruited participants without disabilities to compare it with another potential dwell-free technique and with a dwell-based eye typing interface. The results indicate it is a fast technique that allows an average of 15.95 words per minute after 100min of typing. Then, we improved the technique through iterative design and evaluation with individuals who have severe motor disabilities. This phase helped to identify and create parameters that allow the technique to be adapted to different users.
