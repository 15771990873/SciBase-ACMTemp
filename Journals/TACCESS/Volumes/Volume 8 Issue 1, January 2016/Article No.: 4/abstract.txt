A critical element of accessibility research is the exploration and evaluation of ideas with representative users. However, it is often difficult to recruit such a range of users, particularly in a timely manner, nor is it easy for new researchers to understand how to recruit relevant populations or feel confident in communicating with older or “vulnerable” users. We report on the establishment of a large user pool created to facilitate accessibility research through recruiting sizeable numbers of older adults potentially interested in taking part in research studies about technology. We suggest points to guide new researchers and invite other experts to build on these. We also sketch some of the lessons learned from creating and maintaining this pool of individuals, including thoughts on issues for others wishing to set up similar pools.
