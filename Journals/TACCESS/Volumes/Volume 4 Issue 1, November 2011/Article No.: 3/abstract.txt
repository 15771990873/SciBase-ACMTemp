In the United States alone, more than five million people are living with long term motor impairments caused by a stroke. Recently, video games with affordable motion-based input devices have been proposed as a part of therapy to help people recover lost range of motion and motor control. While researchers have demonstrated the potential utility of therapeutic games through controlled studies, relatively little work has explored their long-term home-based use. We conducted a six-week home study with a 62-year-old woman who was seventeen years post-stroke. She played therapeutic games for approximately one hour a day, five days a week. Over the six weeks, she recovered significant motor abilities, which is unexpected given the time since her stroke. We explore detecting such improvements early, using game logs for daily measurements of motor ability to complement the standard measurements that are taken less often. Through observations and interviews, we present lessons learned about the barriers and opportunities that arise from long-term home-based use of therapeutic games.
