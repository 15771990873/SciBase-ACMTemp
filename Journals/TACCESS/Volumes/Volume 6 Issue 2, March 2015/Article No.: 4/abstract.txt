This article describes the experiences of the first author, who was diagnosed with the neuromuscular disease Friedreich's Ataxia more than 25 years ago, with the innovative approach to human-computer interaction characterized by the software toolOnScreenDualScribe. Originally developed by (and for!) the first author, the tool replaces the standard input devices—that is, keyboard and mouse—with a small numeric keypad, making optimal use of his abilities. This work attempts to illustrate some of the difficulties the first author usually has to face when operating a computer, due to considerable motor problems. The article will discuss what he tried in the past, and whyOnScreenDualScribe, offering various assistive techniques—including word prediction, an ambiguous keyboard, and stepwise pointing operations—is indeed a viable alternative. In a pilot study that was repeated multiple times with slight variations over a period of 3 years, the first author's entry rate withOnScreenDualScribe(including early versions of the tool) increased from 1.38wpm to 6.16wpm, while his achievable typing rate went from 12wpm to 3.5wpm in the course of 24 years. However, the ultimate goal is to help not just one single person, but to make the system—which not only accelerates entry, but also clearly reduces the required effort—available to anyone with similar conditions.
