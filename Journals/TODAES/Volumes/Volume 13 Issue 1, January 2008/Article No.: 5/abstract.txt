We present a C-testable design of polynomial basis (PB) bit-parallel (BP) multipliers over GF(2m) for 100&percnt; coverage of stuck-at faults. Our design method also includes the method for test vector generation, which is simple and efficient. C-testability is achieved with three control inputs and approximately 6&percnt; additional hardware. Only 8 constant vectors are required irrespective of the sizes of the fields and primitive polynomial. We also present a Built-In Self-Test (BIST) architecture for generating the test vectors efficiently, which eliminates the need for the extra control inputs. Since these circuits have critical applications as parts of cryptography (e.g., Elliptic Curve Crypto (ECC) systems) hardware, the BIST architecture may provide with added level of security, as the tests would be done internally and without the requirement of probing by external testing equipment. Finally we present experimental results comprising the area, delay and power of the testable multipliers of various sizes with the help of the SynopsysÂ® tools usingUMC 0.18micron CMOS technology library.
