We propose an efficient algorithm to construct a low-power zero-skew gated clock network, given the module locations and activity information. Unlike previous works, we consider masking logic insertion and buffer insertion simultaneously, and guarantee to yield a zero-skew clock tree. Both the logical and physical information of the modules are carefully taken into consideration when determining where masking logic should be inserted. We also account for the power overhead of the control signals so that the total average power consumption of the constructed zero-skew gated clock network can be minimized. To this end, we present a recursive approach to compute the effective switched capacitance of a general gated and buffered clock network, accounting for both the clock tree's and controller tree's switched capacitance. The power consumptions of the gated clock networks constructed by our algorithm are 20 to 36&percnt; lower than those reported in the best previous work in the literature.
