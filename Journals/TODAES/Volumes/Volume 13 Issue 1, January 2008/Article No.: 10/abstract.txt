Single Chip Heterogeneous Multiprocessors executing a wide variety of software are increasingly common in consumer electronics. Because of the mix of real-time and best effort software across the entire chip, a key design element of these systems is the choice of scheduling strategy. Without task migration, the benefits of single chip processing cannot be fully realized. Previously, high-level modeling environments have not been capable of modeling asynchronous events such as interrupts and preemptive scheduling while preserving the performance benefits of high level simulation. This paper shows how extensions to Modeling Environment for Software and Hardware (MESH) enable precise modeling of these asynchronous events while running more than 1000 faster than cycle-accurate simulation. We discuss how we achieved this and illustrate its use in modeling preemptive scheduling. We evaluate the potential of migrating running tasks between processors to improve performance in a multimedia cell phone example. We show that by allowing schedulers to rebalance processor loads as new tasks arrive significant performance gains can be achieved over statically partitioned and dynamic scheduling approaches. In our example, we show that system response time can be improved by as much as 1.96 times when a preemptive migratory scheduler is used, despite the overhead incurred by scheduling tasks across multiple processors and transferring state during the migration of running tasks. The contribution of this work is to provide a framework for evaluating preemptive scheduling policies and task migration in a high level simulator, by combining the new ability to model interrupts with dramatically increased efficiency in the high-level modeling of scheduling and commuincation MESH already provides.
