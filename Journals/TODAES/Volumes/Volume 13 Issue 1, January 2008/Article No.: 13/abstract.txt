In this article, a wavelet-based dynamic power management policy (WBDPM) is proposed. In this approach, the workload source (service requester) is modeled by a nonstationary time series which, in turn, represented by a nondecimated Haar wavelet as its basis. The proposed approach is robust and has the ability to minimize energy dissipation under different performance constraints. To assess the accuracy of the model, the algorithm was implemented for data extracted from the hard disks of computers. Prediction results of this approach for the case of a nonstationary service requester exhibit accuracies of more than 95&percnt;.
