A new efficient algorithm is derived for the minimal period retiming by formal manipulation. Contrary to all previous algorithms, which used fixed period feasibility checking to binary-search a candidate range, the derived algorithm checks the optimality of a feasible period directly. It is much simpler and more efficient than previous algorithms. Experimental results showed that it is even faster than ASTRA, an efficient heuristic algorithm. Since the derived algorithm is incremental by nature, it also opens the opportunity to be combined with other optimization techniques.
