In this article we demonstrate a floating point FFT processor that leverages both 3D integration and a unique hypercube memory division scheme to reduce the power consumption of a 1024 point FFT down to 4.227Î¼J. The hypercube memory division scheme lowers the energy per memory access by 59.2&percnt; and increases the total required area by 16.8&percnt;. The use of 3D integration reduces the logic power by 5.2&percnt;. We describe the tool flow required to realize the 3D implementation and perform a thermal analysis of it.
