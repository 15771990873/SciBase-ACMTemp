The emergence of Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) as the most relevant source of reliability in sub-90nm technologies has led to a new facet of the traditional trade-off between power and reliability. NBTI effects in fact manifest themselves as an increase of the propagation delay of the devices over time, which adds up to the delay penalty incurred by most low-power design solutions. This implies that, given a desired lifetime of a circuit (i.e., a given performance target at some point in time), a power-managed component will fail earlier than a nonpower-managed one.In this work, we show how it is possible to partially overcome this conflict, by leveraging the benefits in terms of aging provided by power-gating (i.e., by using switches that disconnect a logic block from the ground). Thanks to some electrical properties, it is possible to nullify aging effects during standby periods.Based on this important property, we propose a methodology for aNBTI-awarepower gating that allows synthesizing low-leakage circuits with maximum lifetime.
