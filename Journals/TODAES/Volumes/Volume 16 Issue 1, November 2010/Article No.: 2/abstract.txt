Subthreshold operation of digital circuits enables minimum energy consumption. In this article, we observe that minimum energy Eminof subthreshold logic dramatically increases when reaching 45nm CMOS node. We demonstrate by circuit simulation and analytical modeling that this increase comes from the combined effects of variability, gate leakage, and Drain-Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL) effect. We then investigate the new impact of individual MOSFET parameters Lg, Vt, and Toxon Eminin sub-45nm technologies. We further propose an optimum MOSFET selection, which favors low-Vtmid-Lgdevices in 45nm CMOS technology. The use of such optimum MOSFETs yields 35&percnt; Eminreduction for a benchmark multiplier with good speed performances and negligible area overhead. This optimum MOSFET selection can easily be integrated into a standard EDA tool flow by appropriate selection of the standard cell library.We finally demonstrate that undoped-channel fully-depleted Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI) technology brings 60&percnt; Eminreduction with baseline MOSFETs thanks to strong mitigation of variability and short-channel effects. This study reveals a new (Ã  priori counterintuitive) paradigm in device optimization for subthreshold logic: relaxing gate leakage constraints to improve robustness against short-channel effects and variability. Additionally, we propose pre-Silicon BSIM4 MOSFET model cards for realistic subthreshold circuit simulations including variability in bulk and fully depleted SOI technologies, which are made available online.
