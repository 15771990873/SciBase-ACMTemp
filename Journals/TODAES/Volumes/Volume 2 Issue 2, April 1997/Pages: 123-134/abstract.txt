This paper explores parallel logic simulation on a network of workstations using a parallel virtual machine (PVM). A novel parallel implementation of the centralized-time event-driven logic simulation algorithm is carried out such that no global controlling workstation is needed to synchronize the advance of simulation time. Further advantages of our new approach include a random partitioning of the circuit onto available workstations and a pipelined execution of the different phases of the simulation algorithm. To achieve a better load balance, we employ a semioptimistic scheme for gate evaluations (in conjunction with a centralized-time algorithm) such that no rollback is required. The performance of this implementation has been evaluated using the ISCAS benchmark circuits. Speedups improve with the size of the circuit and the activity level in the circuit. Analyses of the communication overhead show that the techniques developed here will yield even higher gains as newer networking technologies like ATM are employed to connect workstations.
