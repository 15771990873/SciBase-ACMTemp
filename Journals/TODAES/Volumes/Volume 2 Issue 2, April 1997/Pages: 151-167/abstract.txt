We consider a board-level routing problem applicable to FPGA-based logic emulation systems such as the Realizer System [Varghese et al. 1993] and the Enterprise Emulation System [Maliniak 1992] manufactured by Quickturn Design Systems. Optimal algorithms have been proposed for the case where all nets are two-terminal nets [Chan and Schlag 1993; Mak and Wong 1995]. We show how multiterminal nets can be handled by decomposition into two-terminal nets. We show that the multiterminal net decomposition problem can be modeled as a bounded-degree hypergraph-to-graph transformation problem where hyperedges are transformed to spanning trees. A network flow-based algorithm that solves both problems is proposed. It determines if there is a feasible decomposition and gives one whenever such a decomposition exists.
