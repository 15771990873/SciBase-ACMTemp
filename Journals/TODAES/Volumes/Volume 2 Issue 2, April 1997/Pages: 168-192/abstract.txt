We give new methods for calculating the time-domain response for a finite-length distributedRCline that is stimulated by a ramp input. The following are our contributions. First, we obtain the solution of the diffusion equation for a seminfinite distributedRCline with ramp input. We then present a general and, in the limit,exactapproach to compute the time-domain response for finite-lengthRClines under ramp input by summing distinct diffusions starting at either end of the line. Next, we obtain analytical expressions for the finite time-domain voltage response for an open-ended finiteRCline and for a finiteRCline with capacitive load. The delay estimates using this method are very close to SPICE-computing delays. Finally, we present a general recursive equation for computing the higher-order diffusion components due to reflections at the source and load ends. Future work extends our method to response computations in general interconnection trees by modeling both reflection and transmission coefficients at discontinuities.
