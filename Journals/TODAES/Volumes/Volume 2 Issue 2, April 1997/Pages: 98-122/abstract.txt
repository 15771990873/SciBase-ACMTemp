Control-dominated architectures are usually described in a hardware description language (HDL) by means of interacting FSMs. A VHDL or Verilog specification can be translated into an interacting FSM (IFSM) representation as described here. The IFSM model allows us to approach the testable synthesis problem at the level of each FSM. The functionality is modified by the addition of transparency to data flow. The complete testability of the IFSM implementation is thus achieved by connecting fully testable implementations of each modified FSM. In this way, test sequences separately generated for each FSM are directly applied to the IFSM to achieve complete fault coverage. The addition of test functionality to each FSM description, and its simultaneous synthesis with the FSM functionality, produces a lower area overhead than that necessary for the application of a partial-scan technique. Moreover, the test generation problem is highly simplified since it is reduced to the test generation for each separate FSM.
