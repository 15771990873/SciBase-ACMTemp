A fast and efficient algorithm for technology mapping of electrically programmable gate arrays (EPGAs) is proposed. This Hmap algorithm covers the Boolean network with programmed logic modules bottom-up. The covering operation is based on collapsing the fanins of a node to form a bigger supernode such that fewer clusters are needed to be detected. Then Boolean matching is used to detect whether the collapsed supernode can be mapped into a logic module by looking up an extended GBDD hash table. The use of this table look-up matching can shorten the matching time significantly. As shown in the experiments, the average running time of Hmap is 20 times faster than that of MIS-pga2.
