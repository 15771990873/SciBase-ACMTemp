For Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS), we propose a novel design methodology. This methodology is composed of an error detection circuit and three technologies to reduce the area and power penalties which are the large issues for the conventional DVS with error detection. The proposed circuit, Phase-Adjustable Error Detection Flip-Flip (PEDFF), adjusts the clock phase of an additional FF for the timing error detection, based on the timing slack. 2-Stage Hold-Driven Optimization (2-SHDO) technology splits the hold-driven optimization in two stages. Slack-Based Grouping Scheme (SBGS) technology divides each timing path into appropriate groups based on the timing slack. Slack Distribution Control (SDC) technology improves the sharp distribution of the path delay at which the logic synthesis tool has relaxed the delay. We evaluate the methodology by simulating a 32-bit microprocessor in 90 nm CMOS technology. The proposed methodology reduces the energy consumption by 19.8&percnt; compared to non-DVS. The OR-tree's latency is shortened to 16.3&percnt; compared to the conventional DVS. The area and power penalties for delay buffers on short paths are reduced to 35.0&percnt; and 40.6&percnt; compared to the conventional DVS, respectively. The proposed methodology with SDC reduces the energy consumption by 17.0&percnt; on another example with the sharp slack distribution by the logic synthesis compared to non-DVS.
