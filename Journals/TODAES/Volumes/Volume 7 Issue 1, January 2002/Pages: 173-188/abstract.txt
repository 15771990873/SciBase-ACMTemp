We study the problem of performing buffer insertion in the context of a given layout. In a practical situation, there are restrictions on where buffers may be inserted; for instance, it may be possible to route wires over a preplaced macro cell, but may not be possible to insert buffers in that region. As a result, it is desirable to perform route planning and buffer insertion simultaneously. Furthermore it is necessary that such an algorithm be aware of the trade-off between cost (e.g., total capacitance) and delay. In this context we propose the delay reduction to cost ratio (DRCR) problem and present a fast algorithm for the same. Solutions identified by the algorithm are characterized with respect to the overall cost versus performance trade-off curve. Computational experiments demonstrate the viability of the approach.
