New portable signal-processing applications such as mobile telephony, wireless computing, and personal digital assistants place stringent power consumption limits on their constituent components. Substantial power savings can be realized if 5 V designs are translated to use the new lower supply voltage standards. This conversion, however, is not achieved easily: a design originally targeted for implementation in a 5 V technology will typically require significant rework to meet timing and throughput requirements at the lower operating voltage. In this paper we describe a high-level synthesis system which assists the designer in performing this task, minimizing the need for manual redesign. Techniques employed in this work include pipelining and a new approach to module selection that minimizes power consumption subject to timing constraints. Using these and other high-level synthesis techniques to target designs to 3.3 V libraries, we show that it is possible to reduce power consumption by as much as 56&percnt; as compared to the original 5 V implementation, while meeting specified minimum throughput and maximum latency constraints.
