The existence of false paths represents a significant and computationally complex problem in the estimation of the true delay of combinational and sequential circuits. In this article we conduct a comprehensive study of modeling circuit delay computation, accounting for false paths, as a sequence of instances of Boolean satisfiability. Several path sensitization models and delay models are studied. In addition we evaluate some of the most competitive Boolean satisfiability algorithms seeking to identify which are best suited for solving circuit delay computation problems. Finally, realistic delay modeling (taking into account extracted interconnect delays and fanout data) is considered in order to experimentally evaluate the complexity of solving real-world instances.
