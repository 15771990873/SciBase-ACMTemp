Due to the layout complexity in modern VLSI designs, integrated circuit blocks may not be rectangular. However, literature on general rectilinear block placement is still quite limited. In this article, we present approaches for handling the placement for arbitrarily shaped rectilinear blocks using B*-trees [Chang et al. 2000]. We derive the feasibility conditions of B*-trees to guide the placement of rectilinear blocks. Experimental results show that our algorithm achieves optimal or near-optimal block placement for benchmarks with various shaped blocks.
