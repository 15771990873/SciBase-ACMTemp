Functional partitioning assigns the functions of a system's program-like specification among system components, such as standard-software and custom-hardware processors. We introduce a new transformation, called procedure cloning, that significantly improves functional partitioning results. The transformation creates a clone of a procedure for sole use by a particular procedure caller, so the clone can be assigned to the caller's processor, which in turn improves performance through reduced communication. Heuristics are used to prevent the exponential size increase that could occur if cloning were done indiscriminately. We introduce a variety of cloning heuristics, highlight experiments demonstrating the improvements obtained using cloning, and compare the various cloning heuristics.
