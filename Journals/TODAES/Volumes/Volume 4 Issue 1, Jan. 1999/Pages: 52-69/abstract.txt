In this paper we present a complete Boolean method for reducing the power consumption in two-level combinational circuits. The two-level logic optimizer performs the logic minimization for low power targeting static PLA, general logic gates, and dynamic PLA implementations. We modify the espresso algorithm by adding our heuristics, which bias logic minimization toward lowering power dissipation. In our heuristics, signal probabilities and transition densities are two important parameters. The experimental results are promising.
