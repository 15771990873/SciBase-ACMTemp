In this article, we present an approach to automatic generation of communication topologies for statically scheduled systems of subsystems. Given a specification containing a set of processes that communicate via abstract send and receive functions, we show how a cost-efficient communication topology consisting of one or more buses without arbitration scheme can be set up for such applications.
