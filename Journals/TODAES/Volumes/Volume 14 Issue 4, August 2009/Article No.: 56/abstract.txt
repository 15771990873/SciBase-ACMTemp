A high-performance resistive bridging fault simulator SUPERB (Simulator Utilizing Parallel Evaluation of Resistive Bridges) is proposed. It is based on fault sectioning in combination with parallel-pattern or parallel-fault multiple-stuck-at simulation. It outperforms a conventional interval-based resistive bridging fault simulator by three orders of magnitude while delivering identical results. Further competing tools are outperformed by several orders of magnitude. Industrial-size circuits, including a multi-million-gates design, could be simulated with runtimes within an order of magnitude of the runtimes for pattern-parallel stuck-at fault simulation.
