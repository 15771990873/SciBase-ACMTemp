The problem of optimal space allocation among interconnect wires in a VLSI layout, in order to minimize the switching power consumption and the average signal delay, is addressed in this article. We define a Weighted Power-Delay Sum (WPDS) objective function and derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of optimal interwire space allocation, based on the notion of capacitance density. At the optimum, every wire must be in equilibrium of its line-to-line weighted capacitance density on its two opposite sides, and the WPDS of the whole circuit is minimal if and only if capacitance density is uniformly distributed across the entire layout. This condition is shown to be equivalent to all paths of the layout cross-capacitance graph having the same length and all cuts having the same flow. An implementation which has been used in the design of a recent commercial high-end microprocessor and yielded 17&percnt; power reduction and 9&percnt; delay reduction in top-level interconnects is presented.
