We study the technology mapping problem for sequential circuits for look-up table (LUT) based field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Existing approaches to the problem simply remove the flip-flops (FFs), then map the remaining combinational logic, and finally put the FFs back. These approaches ignore the sequential nature of a circuit and assume the positions of the FFs are fixed. However, FFs in a sequential circuit can be reposistioned by a functionality-preserving transformation called retiming. As a result, existing approaches can only consider a very small portion of the available solution space. We propose in this paper a novel approach to the technology mapping problem. In our approach, retiming is integrated into the technology mapping process so  as to consider the full  solution space. We then present a polynomial technology mapping algorithm that, for a given circuit, produces a mapping solution with the minimum clock period among all possible ways of retiming. The effectiveness of the algorithm is also demonstrated experimentally.
