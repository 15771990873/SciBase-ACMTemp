The defect level in circuit testing is the percentage of circuits such as chips, that are defective and shipped for use after testing. Our previously published results showed that the defect level of circuit fabrication and testing should be a probability distribution, rather than a single value, and the concept of confidence degree was proposed [Gondalia et al. 1993; Jone et al. 1995]. In this work, defect level is represented by a confidence interval which is more conventional and easier to interpret. The point estimate of defect level analysis and conditions to avoid meaningless confidence intervals are also investigated. Methods for adaptive random test length determination driven by different confidence intervals or interval length are proposed to meet both test  requirements and test costs tradeoff. Finally, a complete test plan that can direct the test flow from fabrication infancy to maturity is suggested.
