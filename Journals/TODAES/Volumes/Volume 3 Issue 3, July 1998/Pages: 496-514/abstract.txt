With the increasing density of VLSI circuits, the interconnection wires are being packed even closer. This has increased the effect of interaction among these wires on circuit performance and hence, the importance of controlling crosstalk. In this article, we consider river routing with crosstalk constraints. Given the positions of the pins in a single-layer routing channel and the maximum tolerable crosstalk between each pair of neighboring nets, we give a polynomial time algorithm to decide whether there is a feasible river routing solution and produce one with minimum crosstalk when it is feasible.
