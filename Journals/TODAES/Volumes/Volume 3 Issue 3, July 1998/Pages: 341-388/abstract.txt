We study the minimum-cost bounded-skew routing tree problem under the  pathlength (linear) and Elmore delay models. This problem captures several engineering tradeoffs in the design of routing topologies with controlled skew. Our bounded-skew routing algorithm, called the BST/DME algorithm, extends the DME algorithm for exact zero-skew trees via the concept ofa merging region. For aprescribed topology, BST/DME constructs a bounded-skew tree (BST) in two phases: (i) a bottom-up phase to construct a binary tree of merging regions which represent the loci of possible embedding points of the internal nodes, and (ii) a top-down phase to determine the exact locations of the internal nodes. We present two approaches to construct the  merging regions: (i) theBoundary Merging and Embedding(BME) method which utilizes merging points that are restricted to theboundariesof merging regions, and (ii) theInterior Merging and Embedding(IME) algorithm which employs a sampling strategy and a dynamic programming-based selection technique to consider merging points that areinteriorto, as well as on the boundary of, the merging regions. When the topology is not prescribed, we propose a newGreedy-BST/DME algorithm which combines the merging region computation with topology generation. The Greedy-BST/DME algorithm very closely matches the best known heuristics for the zero-skew case and for the unbounded-skew case (i.e., the Steiner minimal  tree problem). Experimental results show that our BST algorithms can produce a set of routing solutions with smooth skew and wire length tradeoffs.
