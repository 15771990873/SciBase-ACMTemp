Clock meshes are extremely effective at producing low-skew regional clock networks that are tolerant of environmental and process variations. For this reason, clock meshes are used in most high-performance designs, but this robustness consumes significant power. In this work, we present two techniques to optimize high-performance clock meshes. The first technique is a mesh perturbation methodology for nonuniform mesh routing. The second technique is a skew-aware buffer placement through iterative buffer deletion. We demonstrate how these optimizations can achieve significant power reductions and a near elimination of short-circuit power. In addition, the total wire length is decreased, the number of required buffers is decreased, and both skew and robustness are improved on average when variation is considered.
