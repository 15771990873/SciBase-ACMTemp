The Multicore Communications API (MCAPI) is a new message-passing API that was released by the Multicore Association. MCAPI provides an interface designed for closely distributed embedded systems with multiple cores on a chip and/or chips on a board. Similar to parallel programs in other domains, debugging MCAPI programs is a challenging task due to their nondeterministic behavior. In this article we present a tool that is capable of deterministically replaying MCAPI program executions, which provides valuable insight for MCAPI developers in case of failure.
