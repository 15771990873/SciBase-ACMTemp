In this article, we propose novel and global Architecture-Aware Analytic MAPping (A3MAP) algorithms applied to Networks-on-Chip (NoCs) not only with homogeneous Processing Elements (PEs) on a regular mesh network as done by most previous application mapping algorithms but also with heterogeneous PEs on an irregular mesh or custom network. As the main contributions, we develop a simple yet efficient interconnection matrix that can easily model any core graph and network. Then, an application mapping problem is exactly formulated to Mixed Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP). Since MIQP is NP-hard, we propose two effective heuristics, a successive relaxation algorithm achieving short runtime, called A3MAP-SR and a genetic algorithm achieving high mapping quality, called A3MAP-GA. We also propose a partition-based application mapping approach for large-scale NoCs, which provides better trade-off between performance and runtime. Experimental results show that A3MAP algorithms reduce total hop count, compared to the previous application mapping algorithms optimized for a regular mesh network, called NMAP [Murali and Micheli 2004] and for an irregular mesh and custom network, called CMAP [Tornero et al. 2008]. Furthermore, A3MAP algorithms make packets travel shorter distance than CMAP, which is related to energy consumption.
