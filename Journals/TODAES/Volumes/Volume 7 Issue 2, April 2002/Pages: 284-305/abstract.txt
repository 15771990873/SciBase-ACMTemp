Recent trends in FPGA development indicate a strong shift toward design reuse through the use of intellectual property (IP). This design shift has motivated the development of Frontier, a timing-driven FPGA placement system that uses design macroblocks in conjunction with a series of placement algorithms to achieve highly routable and high-performance layouts quickly. In the first stage of design placement, a macro-based floorplanner is used to quickly identify an initial layout based on intermacro connectivity. Next, FPGA routability and performance metrics are used to evaluate the quality of the initial placement. Finally, if the floorplan is determined to be insufficient from a routability or performance standpoint, a feedback-driven placement perturbation step is employed to achieve a lower cost placement. For a collection of large reconfigurable computing benchmark circuits our timing-driven placement system exhibits a 2.6Ã— speedup in combined place and route time versus commercial FPGA CAD software with improved design performance for most designs. It is shown that floorplanning, placement evaluation, and backend optimization are all necessary to achieve high-performance placement solutions.
