We present an efficient algorithm for technology mapping of domino logic to a parameterized library. The algorithm is optimal for mapping trees consisting of two-input AND/OR nodes, and has a computation time that is polynomial in terms of constraint size. The mapping method is then extended to DAG covering that permits the implicit duplication of logic nodes. Our synthesis procedure maps the complementary logic cones independently when AND/OR logic is to be implemented, and together using dual-monotonic gates in the case of XOR/XNOR logic. The mapping procedure solves the output phase assignment problem as a preprocessing step. Based on a key observation that the output phase assignment could reduce the implementation cost due to the possible large cost difference between two polarities, a 0--1 integer linear programming formulation was designed to minimize the implementation cost. Our experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.
