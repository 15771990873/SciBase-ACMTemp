In this article we address the problem of optimization of VLSI circuits to minimize power consumption while meeting performance goals. We present a method of estimating power consumption of a basic or complex CMOS gate which takes the internal capacitances of the gate into account. This method is used to select an ordering of series-connected transistors found in CMOS gates to achieve lower power consumption. The method is very efficient when used by library-based design styles. We describe a multipass algorithm that makes use of transistor reordering to optimize performance and power consumption of circuits, has a linear time complexity per pass, and converges to a solution in a small number of passes. Transformations in addition to transistor reordering can be used by the  algorithm. The algorithm has been benchmarked on several large examples and the results are presented.
