We present two algorithms, called list-based scheme and tree-based scheme, to compute bridging fault (BF) coverage ofIDDQtests. These algorithms use the novel ideal of “indistinguishable pairs,” which makes it more efficient and versatile than known fault simulation algorithms. Unlike known algorithms, the two algorithms can be used for combinational as well as sequential circuits and for arbitrary sets of BFs. Experiments show that the tree-based scheme is, in general, better than the list-based scheme. But the list-based scheme is better for some classes of faults.
