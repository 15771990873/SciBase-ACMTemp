Accurate and efficient computation of delays is a central problem in computer-aided design of complex VLSI circuits. Delays are determined by events (signal transitions) propagated from the inputs of a circuit to its outputs, so precise characterization of event propagation is required for accurate delay computation. Although many different propagation conditions (PCs) have been proposed for delay computation, their properties and relationships have been far from clear. We present a systematic analysis of delay computation based on a series of waveform models that capture signal behavior rigorously at different levels of details. The most general model, called the exact of W0 model, specifies each event occurring in a circuit signal. A novel method is presented that generates  approximate waveforms by progressively eliminating signal values from the exact model. For each waveform model, we drive the PCs that correctly capture the requirements under which an event propagates along a path. The waveform models and their PCs are shown to form a well-defined hierarchy, which provides a means to trade accuracy for computational effort. The relationships among the derived PCs and existing ones are analyzed in depth. It is proven that though many PCs, such as the popular floating mode condition, produce a correct upper bound on the circuit delay, they can fail to recognize event propagation in some instances. This analysis further enables us to derive new and useful PCs. We describe such a PC, called safe static. Experimental results demonstrate that safe static  provides an excellent accuracy/efficiency tradeoff.
