When binding a logic network to a set of cells, a fundamental problem is recognizing whether a cell can implement a portion of the network. Boolean matching means solving this task using a formalism based on Boolean algebra. In its simplest form, Boolean matching can be posed as a tautology check. We review several approaches to Boolean matching as well as to its generalization to cases involvingdon't careconditions and its restriction to specific libraries such as those typical of anti-fuse based FPGAs. We then present a general formulation of Boolean matching supporting multiple-output logic cells.
