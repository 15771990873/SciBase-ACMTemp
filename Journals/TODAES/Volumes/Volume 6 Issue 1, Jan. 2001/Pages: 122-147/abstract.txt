We present a technique for automatic exploration of architectural alternatives in the design of complex electronic embedded systems and systems-on-a-chip. The technique transforms the problem into a set of simple model-to-model operations and a mapping algorithm that becomes the core of the entire design process. The mapping algorithm is formulated as an assignment-type problem (ATP), which is, in turn, solved by a straightforward optimization method. The result is a design assistance tool, which is demonstrated through a telecommunication systems example.
