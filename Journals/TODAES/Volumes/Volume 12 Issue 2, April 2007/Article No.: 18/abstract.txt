We describe a procedure for formingn-detection test sets forn>1 without applying a test generation procedure to target faults. The proposed procedure accepts a one-detection test set. It extracts test cubes for target faults from the one-detection test set, and merges the test cubes to obtain new test vectors. By extracting and merging different test cubes in different iterations of this process, ann-detection test set is obtained. Merging of test cubes does not require test generation or fault simulation. Fault simulation is required for extracting test cubes for target faults. We demonstrate that the resulting test set is as effective in detecting untargeted faults as ann-detection test set generated by a deterministic test generation procedure. We also discuss the application of the proposed procedure starting from a random test set (instead of a one-detection test set).
