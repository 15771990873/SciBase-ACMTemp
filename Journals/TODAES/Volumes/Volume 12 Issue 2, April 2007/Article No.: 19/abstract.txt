A switch block ofksidesWterminals on each side is said to be universal (a (k,W)-USB) if it is routable for every set of 2-pin nets of channel density at mostW. The generic optimum universal switch block design problem is to design a (k,W)-USB with the minimum number of switches for every pair of (k,W). This problem was first proposed and solved fork&equals;4 in Chang et al. [1996], and then solved for evenWor fork≤6 in Shuy et al. [2000] and Fan et al. [2002b]. No optimum (k,W)-USB is known fork≥7 and oddW≥3. But it is already known that whenWis a large odd number, a near-optimum (k,W)-USB can be obtained by a disjoint union of (W−f2(k))/2 copies of the optimum (k, 2)-USB and a noncompound (k,f2(k))-USB, where the value off2(k) is unknown fork≥8. In this article, we show thatf2(k) &equals;k&plus;3−i/3, where 1≤i≤6 andi≡k(mod 6), and present an explicit design for the noncompound (k,f2(k))-USB. Combining these two results we obtain the exact designs of (k,W)-USBs for allk≥7 and oddW≥3. The new (k,W)-USB designs also yield an efficient detailed routing algorithm.
