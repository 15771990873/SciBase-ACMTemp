Recent advances in process technology have led to a rapid increase in the density of integrated circuits (ICs). Increased density and the need to test for new types of defects in nanometer technologies have resulted in a tremendous increase in test application time (TAT). This article presents a test synthesis method to reduce test application time for testing the datapath of a design. The test application time is reduced by applying a test-time-aware resource sharing algorithm on a scheduled control data flow graph (CDFG) of a design.
