We consider issues related to the reduction of scan test data in designs with multiple scan chains. We propose a metric that can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of procedures for reducing the scan data volume. The metric compares the achieved compression to the compression which is intrinsic to the use of multiple scan chains. We also propose a procedure for modifying a given test set so as to achieve reductions in test data volume assuming a combinational decompressor circuit.
