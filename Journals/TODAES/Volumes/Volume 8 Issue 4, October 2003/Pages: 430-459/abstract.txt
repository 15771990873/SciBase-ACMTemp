Testing system-on-chips involves applying huge amounts of test data, which is stored in the tester memory and then transferred to the chip under test during test application. Therefore, practical techniques, such as test compression and compaction, are required to reduce the amount of test data in order to reduce both the total testing time and memory requirements for the tester. In this article, a new approach to static compaction for combinational circuits, referred to astest vector decomposition (TVD), is proposed. In addition, two new TVD based static compaction algorithms are presented. Experimental results for benchmark circuits demonstrate the effectiveness of the two new static compaction algorithms.
