Delay faults are an increasingly important test challenge. Modeling bridge faults as delay faults helps delay tests to detect more bridge faults. Traditional bridge fault models are incomplete because these models only model the logic faults or these models are not efficient to use in delay tests for large circuits. In this article, we propose a physically realistic yet economical resistive bridge fault model to model delay faults as well as logic faults. An accurate yet simple delay calculation method is proposed. We also enumerate all possible fault behaviors and present the relationship between input patterns and output behaviors, which is useful in ATPG. Our fault simulation results show the benefit of at-speed tests.
