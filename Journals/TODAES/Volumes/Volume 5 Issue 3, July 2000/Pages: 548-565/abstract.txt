A new method for state justification is proposed for sequential circuit test generation. Thelinearlist of states dynamically obtained during the derivation of test vectors is used to guide the search during state justification. State-transfer sequences that drive the circuit from the current state to the target state may already be known. Otherwise, genetic engineering of existing state-transfer sequences is required. In both cases, genetic-algorithm-based techniques are used to generate valid state justification sequences for the circuit in the presence of the target fault. This approach achieves extremely high fault coverages, and thus outperforms previous deterministic and simulation-based techniques.
