In this paper we outline a theory for theenvironment-modeling problem, the problem of abstracting component finite state machines (FSMs)bordering a particular FSM of interest within a network of interacting FSMs. The goal is to lay a theoretical foundation for the automatic state reduction of large FSM networks. We feel this is a prerequisite for the efficient use of many verification techniques. We focus on computing conditions for thesafe removalof a component FSM in a FSM network, where removal is safe if it preserves a certain well-defined trace equivalence. We present an optimized algorithm for determininglanguage universalityof a FSM, as well as determiningindependenceof a FSM from those of its inputs connected to outputs of neighboring FSMs. These two properties, input independence and language universality, provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for safe removal. In addition, we show how simulation relations can be utilized, both to reduce the cost of computing safe removal and to create an appropriate abstract FSM when safe removal is not possible.
