Along with functional units, storage and interconnects contribute significantly to data path costs. This paper addresses the issue of reducing the costs of storage and interconnect. In a post-datapath synthesis phase, one or more queues can be allocated and variables bound to it, with the goal of reducing storage and interconnect costs. Further, in contrast to earlier work, we support “irregular” cdfgs and multicycle functional units for queue synthesis. Initial results on HLS benchmark examples have been encouraging, and show the potential of using queue synthesis to reduce datapath cost. A novel feature of our work is the formulation of the problem for a variety of FIFO structures with their own “queueing” criteria.
