We present high-level library mapping, a technique that synthesizes a source memory module from a library of target memory modules. In this paper, we define the problem of high-level library mapping for memories, identify and solve the three subproblems associated with this task, and finally combine these solutions into a suite of two memory mapping algorithms. Experimental results on a number of memory-intensive designs demonstrate that our memory mapping approach generates a wide variety of cost-effective designs, often counter-intuitive ones, based on a user-given cost function, the target library, and the mapping algorithm used.
