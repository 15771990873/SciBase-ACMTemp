In this paper, we first present an algorithm (FILL) to efficiently identify a large subset of illegal states in synchronous sequential circuits, without assuming a global reset mechanism. A second algorithm, FUNI, finds sequentially untestable faults whose detection requires some of the illegal states computed by FILL. Although based on binary decision diagrams (BDDs), FILL is able to process large circuits by using a new functional partitioning procedure. The incremental building of the set of illegal states guarantees that FILL will always obtain at least a partial solution. FUNI is a direct method that identifies untestable faults without using the exhaustive search involved in automatic test generation (ATG). Experimental results show that FUNI finds a large number of untestable  faults up to several orders of magnitude faster than an ATG algorithm that targeted the faults identified by FUNI. Also, many untestable faults identified by FUNI were aborted by the test generator.
