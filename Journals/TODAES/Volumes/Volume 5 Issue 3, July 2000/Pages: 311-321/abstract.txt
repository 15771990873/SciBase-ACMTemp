We propose a technique for synthesizing low-power systems from behavioral specifications. We analyze the control flow of the specification model to detect mutually exclusive sections of the computation. Aselectively-clockedinterconnection of interacting FSMs is automatically generated and optimized, where each FSM controls the execution of one section of computation. Only one of the interacting FSMs is active for a high fraction of the operation time, while the others are idle and their clocks are stopped. Periodically, the active machine releases the control of the system to another FSM and stops. Our interacting FSM implementation achieves consistently lower power dissipation than the functionally equivalent monolithic implementation. On average, 37% power savings  and 12% speedup are obtained, despite a 30% area overhead.
