Testing for small-delay defects (SDDs) requires fault-effect propagation along the longest testable paths. However, identification of the longest testable paths requires high CPU time, and the sensitization of all such paths leads to large pattern counts. Dynamic test compaction for small-delay defects is therefore necessary to reduce test-data volume. We present a new technique for identifying the longest testable paths through each gate in order to accelerate test generation for SDDs. The resulting test patterns sensitize the longest testable paths that pass through each SDD site. An efficient dynamic test compaction method based on structural analysis is presented to reduce the pattern count substantially, while ensuring that all the longest paths for each SDD are sensitized. Simulation results for a set of ISCAS 89 and IWLS 05 benchmark circuits demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.
