Stringent quality requirements for integrated, heterogeneous systems have led designers and test engineers to mandate large sets of tests to be applied to these systems, which, in turn, have resulted in increased test cost. However, many of these tests are unnecessary (i.e., redundant), since their outcomes can be reliably predicted using results from other applied tests. A methodology for identifying the redundant tests of an integrated, heterogeneous system that has only binary pass-fail test data is described. This methodology uses decision trees, Boolean minimization, and satisfiability as core components. Feasibility is empirically demonstrated using test data from two commercially fabricated systems, namely, a high-speed serializer/deserializer (HSS) and a phase-locked loop (PLL). Our analysis of test data from > 38,000 HSS and > 22,000 PLL circuits show that 14 out of 40 HSS tests and 11 out of 36 PLL tests are redundant.
