This article studies the generation of low-power skewed-load tests such that the signal transitions (and line values) they create during their fast functional clock cycles match those of functional broadside tests. Functional broadside tests create functional operation conditions during their fast functional clock cycles. As a result, the signal transitions that occur during these clock cycles can also occur during functional operation. The procedure described in this article matches these signal-transitions on aline-by-linebasis when generating low-power skewed-load tests. The procedure accepts a functional broadside test set for transition faults. In one of its basic steps, the procedure modifies a functional broadside test into a skewed-load test. This allows it to retain many of the signal transitions (and line values) of the functional broadside test in the skewed-load test. Experimental results for benchmark circuits demonstrate the extent to which it is possible to match the signal-transitions of skewed-load tests with those of functional broadside tests while achieving the high transition fault coverage that is typical of skewed-load tests.
