Whereas the computing power of DSP or general-purpose processors was sufficient for 3G baseband telecommunication algorithms, stringent timing constraints of 4G wireless telecommunication systems require computing-intensive data-driven architectures. Managing the complexity of these systems within the energy constraints of a mobile terminal is becoming a major challenge for designers. System-level low-power policies have been widely explored for generic software-based systems, but data-flow architectures used for high data-rate telecommunication systems feature heterogeneous components that require specific configurations for power management. In this study, we propose an innovative power optimization scheme tailored to self-synchronized data-flow systems. Our technique, based on the synchronous data-flow modeling approach, takes advantage of the latest low-power techniques available for digital architectures. We illustrate our optimization method on a complete 4G telecommunication baseband modem and show the energy savings expected by this technique considering present and future silicon technologies.
