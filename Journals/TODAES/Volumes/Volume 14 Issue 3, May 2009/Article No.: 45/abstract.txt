Rectilinear Steiner trees are used to route signal nets by global and detail routers in VLSI design for a long time. However, in current IC industry, there are significantly increasing obstacles to be considered, such as large-scale power networks, pre-routed nets, IP blocks, and antenna jumpers. Accordingly, theobstacle-avoiding rectilinear Steiner minimal tree(OARSMT) problem has become more important. In this article, we propose a new routing graph,obstacle-avoiding routing graph(OARG), for the OARSMT problem. Due to the important properties of OARG, we construct a 3-step algorithm and a local refinement scheme, which both can take advantage of these properties, to find a suboptimal solution efficiently. Furthermore, each step of our 3-step algorithm as well as the local refinement scheme has theoretical or practical benefits. Therefore, each of them can be applicable to other existing works for general or specific considerations such as efficiency or effectiveness. Extensive experimental results show that our method outperforms all existing works in terms of wirelength and achieves the best speed performance.
