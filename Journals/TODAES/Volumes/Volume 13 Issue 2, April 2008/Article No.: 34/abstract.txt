The Input vector control (IVC) technique is based on the observation that the leakage current in a CMOS logic gate depends on gate input state, and a good input vector is able to minimize leakage when the circuit is in sleep mode. The gate replacement technique is a very effective method to further reduce the leakage current. In this article, we propose a fast heuristic algorithm to find a low-leakage input vector with simultaneous gate replacement. Results on MCNC91 benchmark circuits show that our algorithm produces 14&percnt; better leakage current reduction with several orders of magnitude speedup in runtime for large circuits compared to the previous state-of-the-art algorithm. In particular, the average runtime for the ten largest combinational circuits has been dramatically reduced from 1879 seconds to 0.34 seconds.
