This article presents a dense logic design for matching multiple regular expressions with a field programmable gate array (FPGA) at 10&plus; Gbps. It leverages on the design techniques that enforce the shortest critical path on most FPGA architectures while optimizing the circuit size. The architecture is capable of supporting a maximum throughput of 12.90 Gbps on a Xilinx Virtex 4 LX200 and its performance is linearly scalable with size. Additionally, this article presents techniques for parsing data streams to provide semantic information for patterns found within a data stream. We illustrate how a content-based router can be implemented with our parsing techniques using an XML parser as an example. The content-based router presented was designed, implemented, and tested in a Xilinx Virtex XCV2000E FPGA on the FPX platform. It is capable of processing 32-bits of data per clock cycle and runs at 100 MHz. This allows the system to process and route XML messages at 3.2 Gbps.
