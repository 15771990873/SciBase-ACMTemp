Due to the nonuniform interconnect scaling in the Deep Sub Micron (DSM) region, the coupling capacitance between wires becomes an increasingly dominant fraction of the total wire capacitance. This couple capacitance introduces server crosstalk which causes delay variations on signal lines and raises signal integrity problems. Therefore, including crosstalk in the timing analysis methods has become imperative for current technologies. And to correctly model the crosstalk, output loading effects, waveform shape and gate driving capability have to be considered. However, most existing crosstalk models have not yet included these factors and consequently suffer from the low accuracy problem. In this article, we propose a noniterative equivalent waveform model that addresses the above mentioned issues. Our experimental results have shown that the new model achieves 3 times speed up and 95&percnt; accuracy compared to the existing models.
