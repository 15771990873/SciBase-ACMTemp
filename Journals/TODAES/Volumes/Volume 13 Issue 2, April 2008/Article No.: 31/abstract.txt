In this article we focus on multiprocessor system-on-chip (MPSoC) architectures for human heart electrocardiogram (ECG) real time analysis as a hardware/software (HW/SW) platform offering an advance relative to state-of-the-art solutions. This is a relevant biomedical application with good potential market, since heart diseases are responsible for the largest number of yearly deaths. Hence, it is a good target for an application-specific system-on-chip (SoC) and HW/SW codesign. We investigate a symmetric multiprocessor architecture based on STMicroelectronics VLIW DSPs that process in real time 12-lead ECG signals. This architecture improves upon state-of-the-art SoC designs for ECG analysis in its ability to analyze the full 12 leads in real time, even with high sampling frequencies, and its ability to detect heart malfunction for the whole ECG signal interval. We explore the design space by considering a number of hardware and software architectural options. Comparing our design with present-day solutions from an SoC and application point-of-view shows that our platform can be used in real time and without failures.
