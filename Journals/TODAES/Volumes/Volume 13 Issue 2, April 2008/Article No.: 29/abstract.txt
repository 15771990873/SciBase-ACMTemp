While RFID is starting to become a ubiquitious technology, the variation between different RFID systems still remains high. This paper presents several prototyping environments for different components of radio frequency identification (RFID) tags to demonstrate how many of these components can be standardized for many different purposes. We include two active tag prototypes, one based on a microprocessor and the second based on custom hardware. To program these devices we present a design automation flow that allows RFID transactions to be described in terms of primitives with behavior written in ANSI C code. To save power with active RFID devices we describe a passive transceiver switch called the “burst switch” and demonstrate how this can be used in a system with a microprocessor or custom hardware controller. Finally, we present a full RFID system prototyping environment based on real-time spectrum analysis technology currently deployed at the University of Pittsburgh RFID Center of Excellence. Using our prototyping techniques we show how transactions from multiple standards can be combined and targeted to several microprocessors include the Microchip PIC, Intel StrongARM and XScale, and AD Chips EISC as well as several hardware targets including the Altera Apex, Actel Fusion, Xilinx Coolrunner II, Spartan 3 and Virtex 2, and cell-based ASICs.
