Reducing power consumption through high-level synthesis has attracted a growing interest from researchers due to its large potential for power reduction. In this work we study functional unit binding (or module assignment) given a scheduled data flow graph under a multi-Vdd framework. We assume that each functional unit can be driven by different Vdd levels dynamically during run time to save dynamic power. We develop a polynomial-time optimal algorithm for assigning low Vdds to as many operations as possible under the resource and latency constraints, and in the same time minimizing total switching activity through functional unit binding. Our algorithm shows consistent improvement over a design flow that separates voltage assignment from functional unit binding. We also change the initial scheduling to examine power/energy-latency tradeoff scenarios under different voltage level combinations. Experimental results show that we can achieve 28.1&percnt; and 33.4&percnt; power reductions when the latency bound is the tightest with two and three-Vdd levels respectively compared with the single-Vdd case. When latency is relaxed, multi-Vdd offers larger power reductions (up to 46.7&percnt;). We also show comparison data of energy consumption under the same experimental settings.
