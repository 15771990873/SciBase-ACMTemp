A parallel prefix circuit hasninputsx1,x2, …,xn, and computes thenoutputsyi&equals;xi•xi−1•…•x1, 1 ≤i≤n, in parallel, where • is an arbitrary binary associative operator. Snir proved that the depthtand sizesof any parallel prefix circuit satisfy the inequalityt&plus;s≥2n−2. Hence, a parallel prefix circuit is said to be of zero-deficiency if equality holds. In this article, we provide a different proof for Snir's theorem by capturing the structural information of zero-deficiency prefix circuits. Following our proof, we propose a new kind of zero-deficiency prefix circuitZ(d) by constructing a prefix circuit as wide as possible for a given depthd. It is proved that theZ(d) circuit has the minimal depth among all possible zero-deficiency prefix circuits.
