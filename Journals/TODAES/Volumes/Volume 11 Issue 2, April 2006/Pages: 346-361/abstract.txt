The problem of fault grading for multiple path delay faults is introduced and a method of obtain exact coverage is presented. The faults are represented and manipulated as combinational sets using zero-suppressed binary decision diagrams. The presented methodology for fault grading uses only a polynomial number of zero-suppressed binary decision diagram operations. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated by the experimental results on the ISCAS'85 and ISCAS'89 benchmarks.
