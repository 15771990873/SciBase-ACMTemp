Thebuffer blockmethodology has become increasingly popular as more and more buffers are needed in deep-submicron design, and it leads to many challenging problems in physical design. In this article, we present a polynomial-time exact algorithm for integrated pin assignment and buffer planning for all two-pin nets from one macro block (source block) to all other blocks of a given buffer block plan, while minimizing the total cost α &dot;W&plus; β &dot;Rfor any positive α and β whereWis the total wirelength, andRis the number of buffers. By applying this algorithm iteratively (each time, pick one block as the source block), it provides a polynomial-time algorithm for pin assignment and buffer planning for nets among multiple macro blocks. Experimental results demonstrate its efficiency and effectiveness.
