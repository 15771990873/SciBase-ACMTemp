Scan chain insertion can have a large impact on routability, wirelength, and timing of the design. We present arouting-drivenmethodology for scan chain ordering with minimum wirelength objective. A routing-based approach to scan chain ordering, while potentially more accurate, can result in TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem) instances which are asymmetric and highly nonmetric; this may require a careful choice of solvers. We evaluate our new methodology on recent industry place-and-route blocks with 1200 to 5000 scan cells. We show substantial wirelength reductions for the routing-based flow versus the traditional placement-based flow. In a number of our test cases, over 86&percnt; of scan routing overhead is saved. Even though our experiments are, so far, timing oblivious, the routing-based flow also improves evaluated timing, and practical timing-driven extensions appear feasible.
