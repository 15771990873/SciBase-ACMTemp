A novel storage requirement estimation methodology is presented for use in the early system design phases when the data transfer ordering is only partially fixed. At that stage, none of the existing estimation tools are adequate, as they either assume a fully specified execution order or ignore it completely. A prototype CAD tool has been developed that includes major parts of the storage requirement estimation and optimization methodology. Using representative application demonstrators, we show how our techniques and tool can effectively guide the designer to achieve a transformed specification with low storage requirement.
