Supply current measurement-based test is a valuable defect-based test method for semiconductor chips. Both static leakage current (IDDQ) and transient current (IDDT) based tests have the capability of detecting unique defects that improve the fault detection capacity of a test suite. Collectively these test methods are known as IDDXtests. However, due to advances in the semiconductor manufacturing process, the future of these test methods is uncertain. This paper presents a survey of the research reported in the literature to extend the use of IDDXtests to deep sub-micron (DSM) technologies.
