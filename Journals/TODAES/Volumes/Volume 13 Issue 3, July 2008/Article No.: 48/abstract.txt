We propose a processor virtualization architecture, VIRTUS, to provide a dedicated domain for preinstalled applications and virtualized domains for downloaded native applications. With it, security-oriented next-generation mobile terminals can provide any number of domains for native applications. VIRTUS features three new technologies, namely, VMM asymmetrization, dynamic interdomain communication (IDC), and virtualization-assist logic, and it is first in the world to virtualize an ARM-based multiprocessor. Evaluations have shown that VMM asymmetrization results in significantly less performance degradation and LOC increase than do other VMMs. Further, dynamic IDC overhead is low enough, and virtualization-assist logic can be implemented in a sufficiently small area.
