The Scale vector-thread processor is a complexity-effective solution for embedded computing which flexibly supports both vector and highly multithreaded processing. The 7.1-million transistor chip has 16 decoupled execution clusters, vector load and store units, and a nonblocking 32KB cache. An automated and iterative design and verification flow enabled a performance-, power-, and area-efficient implementation with two person-years of development effort. Scale has a core area of 16.6 mm2in 180 nm technology, and it consumes 400 mW--1.1 W while running at 260 MHz.
