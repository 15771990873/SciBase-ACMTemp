Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) has emerged as a backbone for high-speed broadband telecommunication networks. In this paper, we present ATM switch design, starting from a parametric high-level model and debugging the model using a combination of formal verification and simulation. The model has been used to synthesize ATM switches according to customers' choices, by choosing concrete values for each of the generic parameters. We provide a pragmatic combination of simulation, model checking, and theorem proving to gain confidence in the ATM switch design correctness.
