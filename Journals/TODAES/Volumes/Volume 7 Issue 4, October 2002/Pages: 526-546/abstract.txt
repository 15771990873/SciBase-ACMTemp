Ak-side switch block withWterminals per side is said to be a universal switch block ((k,W)-USB) if every set of the nets satisfying the routing constraint (i.e., the number of nets on each side is at mostW) is simultaneously routable through the switch block. The (4,W)-USB was originated by designing better switch modules for 2-D FPGAs, such as Xilinx XC4000-type FPGAs, whereas the generic USBs can be applied in multidimensional or some nonconventional 2-D FPGA architectures. The problem we study in this article is to design (k,W)-USBs with the minimum number of switches for any given pair of (k,W). We provide graph models for routing requirements and switch blocks and develop a series of decomposition theorems for routing requirements with the help of a new graph model. The powerful decomposition theory leads to the automatic generation of routing requirements and a detailed routing algorithm, as well as the reduction design method of building large USBs by smaller ones. As a result, we derive a class of well-structured and highly scalable optimum (k,W)-USBs fork≤ 6, or evenWs, and near-optimum (k,W)-USBs fork≥ 7 and oddWs. We also give routing experiments to justify the routing improvement upon the entire chip using the USBs. The results demonstrate the usefulness of USBs.
