In this article, we introduce a new placement problem motivated by the Dynamically Reconfigurable FPGA (DRFPGA) architectures. Unlike traditional placement, the problem for DRFPGAs must consider the precedence constraints among logic components. For the placement, we develop an effective metric that can consider wirelength, register requirement, and power consumption simultaneously. With the considerations of the new metric and the precedence constraints, we then present a three-stage scheme of partitioning, initial placement generation, and placement refinement to solve the new placement problem. Experimental results show that our placement scheme with the new metric achieves respective improvements of 17.2, 27.0, and 35.9&percnt; in wirelength, the number of registers, and power consumption requirements, compared with the list scheduling method.
