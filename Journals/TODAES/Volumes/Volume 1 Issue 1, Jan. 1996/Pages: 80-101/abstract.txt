A switch moduleMwithWterminals on each side is said to beuniversalif every set of nets satisfying the dimensional constraint (i.e., the number of nets on each side ofMis at mostW) is simultaneously rout able throughM. In this article, we present a class of universal switch modules. Each of our switch modules has 6Wswitches andswitch-module flexibilitythree (i.e,Fs=3). We prove that no switch module with less than 6Wswitches can be universal. We also compare our switch modules with those used in the Xilinx XC4000 family FPGAs and theantisymmetricswitch modules (withFS=3) suggested by Rose and Brown [1991]. Although these two kinds of switch modules also haveFS=3 and 6Wswitches, we show that they are not universal. Based on combinatorial counting techniques, we show that each of our universal switch modules can accommodate up to 25% more routing instances, compared with the XC4000-type switch module of the same size. Experimental results demonstrate that our universal switch modules improve routability at the chip level. Finally, our work also provides a theoretical insight into the important observation by Rose and Brown [1991] (based on extensive experiments) thatFS=3 is often sufficient to provide high  routability.
