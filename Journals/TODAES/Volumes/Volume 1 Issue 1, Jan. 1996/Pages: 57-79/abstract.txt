We present a method of automatic generation of functional vectors for sequential circuits. These vectors can be used for design verification, manufacturing testing, or power estimation. A high-level description of the circuit in VHDL or C is assumed available. Our method automatically transforms the high-level description of a circuit in VHDL or C into an extended finite state machine (EFSM) model that is used to generate functional vectors. The EFSM model is a generalization of the traditional state machine model. It is a compact representation of models with local data variables and preserves many nice properties of a traditional state machine model. The theoretical background of the EFSM model is addressed in this article. Our method guarantees that the generated vectors cover every statement in the high-level description at least once. Experimental results show that a set of comprehensive functional vectors for sequential circuits with more than a hundred flip-flops can be generated automatically in a few minutes of CPU time using our prototype system.
