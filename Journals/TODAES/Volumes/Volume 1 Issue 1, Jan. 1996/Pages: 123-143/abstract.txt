We study the problem of folding an ordered list of standard and custom cells into rows of a chip so as to minimize either the routing area or the total chip area. Nine versions of the folding problem are formulated and fast polynomial time algorithms are obtained for each. Two of our formulations correspond to problems formulated in Paik and Sahni [1993] for the folding of a stack of bit-slice components. Our algorithms for these two formulations are asymptotically superior to those of Paik and Sahni [1993].
