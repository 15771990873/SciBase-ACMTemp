Processor fault diagnosis plays an important role in measuring the reliability of multiprocessor systems and the diagnosis of many well-known interconnection networks. The conditional diagnosability, which is more general than the classical diagnosability, is to measure the diagnosability of a multiprocessor system under the assumption that all of the neighbors of any node in the system cannot fail at the same time. This study shows that the conditional diagnosability fork-aryn-cubes under the PMC model is 8n− 7 fork≥ 4 andn≥ 4.
