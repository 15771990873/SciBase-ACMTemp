The accepted wisdom is that combinational circuits must haveacyclic(i.e., feed-forward) topologies. Yet simple examples suggest that this is incorrect. In fact, introducing cycles (i.e., feedback) into combinational designs can lead to significant savings in area and in delay. Prior work described methodologies for synthesizing cyclic circuits with Sum-Of-Product (SOP) and Binary-Decision Diagram (BDD)-based formulations. Recently, techniques foranalyzingandmappingcyclic circuits based on Boolean satisfiability (SAT) were proposed. This article presents a SAT-based methodology forsynthesizingcyclic dependencies. The strategy is to generate cyclic functional dependencies through a technique called Craig interpolation. Given a choice of different functional dependencies, a branch-and-bound search is performed to pick the best one. Experiments on benchmark circuits demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.
