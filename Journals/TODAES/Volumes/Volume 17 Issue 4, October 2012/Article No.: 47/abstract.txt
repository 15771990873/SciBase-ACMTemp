We present a symbolic-event-propagation-based scheme to generate hazard-free tests for robust path delay faults. This approach identifies all robustly testable paths in a circuit and the corresponding complete set of test vectors. We address the problem of finding a minimal set of test vectors that covers all robustly testable paths. We propose greedy and simulated-annealing-based algorithms to find the same. Results on ISCAS89 benchmark circuits show a considerable reduction in test vectors for covering all robustly testable paths.
