Test data compression is a much more difficult problem for launch-on-capture (LOC) delay testing, because test data for LOC delay testing is much more than that of stuck-at fault testing, and LOC delay fault test generation in the two-frame circuit model can specify many more inputs. A new scan architecture is proposed to compress test stimulus data, compact test responses, and reduce test application time for LOC delay fault testing. The new scan architecture merges a number of scan flip-flops into the same group, where all scan flip-flops in the same group are assigned the same values for all test pairs. Sufficient conditions are presented for including any pair of scan flip-flops into the same group for LOC transition, non-robust path delay, and robust path delay fault testing. Test data for LOC delay testing based on the new scan architecture can be compressed significantly. Test application time can also be reduced greatly. Sufficient conditions are presented to construct a test response compactor for LOC transition, non-robust, and robust path delay fault testing. Folded scan forest and test response compactor are constructed for further test data compression. Sufficient experimental results are presented to show the effectiveness of the method.
