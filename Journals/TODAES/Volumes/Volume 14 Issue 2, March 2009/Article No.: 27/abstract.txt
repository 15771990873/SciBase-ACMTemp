In general, fault dictionary is prevented from practical applications in fault diagnosis due to its extremely large size. Several previous works are proposed for the fault dictionary size reduction. However, some of them fail to bring down the size to an acceptable level, and others might not be able to handle today's million-gate circuits due to their high time and space complexity. In this article, an algorithm is presented to reduce the size of pass-fail dictionary while still preserving high diagnostic resolution. The proposed algorithm possesses low time and space complexity by avoiding constructing the huge distinguishability table, which inevitably boosts up the required computation complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is capable of handling industrial million-gate large circuits in a reasonable amount of runtime and memory.
