In this article, we present BoxRouter 2.0, and discuss its architecture and implementation. As high-performance VLSI design becomes more interconnect-dominant, efficient congestion elimination in global routing is in greater demand. Hence, we propose a global router which has a strong ability to improve routability and minimize the number of vias with blockages, while minimizing wirelength. BoxRouter 2.0 is extended from BoxRouter 1.0, but can perform multi-layer routing with 2D global routing and layer assignment. Our 2D global routing is equipped with two ideas: node shifting for congestion-aware Steiner tree and robust negotiation-based A&ast; search for routing stability. After 2D global routing, 2D-to-3D mapping is done by the layer assignment which is powered by progressive via/blockage-aware integer linear programming. Experimental results show that BoxRouter 2.0 has better routability with comparable wirelength than other routers on ISPD07 benchmark, and it can complete (no overflow) the widely used ISPD98 benchmark for the first time in the literature with the shortest wirelength. We further generate a set of harder ISPD98 benchmarks to push the limit of BoxRouter 2.0, and propose the hardened ISPD98 benchmarks to map state-of-the-art solutions for future routing research.
