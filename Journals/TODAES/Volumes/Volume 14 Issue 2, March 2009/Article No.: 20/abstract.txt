With the shift towards deep submicron (DSM) technologies, the increase in leakage power and the adoption of power-aware design methodologies have resulted in potentially significant variations in power consumption under different process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) corners. In this article, we first investigate the impact of PVT corners on power consumption at the system-on-chip (SoC) level, especially for the on-chip communication infrastructure. Given a target technology library, we then show how it is possible to “scale up” and abstract the PVT variability at the system level, allowing characterization of the PVT-aware design space early in the design flow. We conducted several experiments to estimate power for PVT corner cases, at the gate level, as well as at the higher system level. Our preliminary results are very interesting, and indicate that (i) there are significant variations in power consumption across PVT corners; and (ii) the PVT-aware power estimation problem may be amenable to a reasonably simple abstraction at the system level.
