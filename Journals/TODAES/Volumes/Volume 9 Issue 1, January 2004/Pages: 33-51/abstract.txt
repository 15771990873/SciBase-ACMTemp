We study the technology mapping problem for LUT-based FPGAs targeting at power minimization. The problem has been proved to be NP-hard previously. Therefore, we present an efficient heuristic algorithm to generate low-power mapping solutions. The key idea is to compute and select low-powerK-feasible cuts by an efficient incremental network flow computation method. Experimental results show that our algorithm reduces power consumption as well as area over the best algorithms reported in the literature. In addition, we present an extension to compute depth-optimal low-power mappings. Compared with Cutmap, a depth-optimal mapper with simultaneous area minimization, we achieve a 14&percnt; power savings on average without any depth penalty.
