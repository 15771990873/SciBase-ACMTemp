New techniques are presented for routing straight channels, L-channels, switchboxes, and staircase channels in a two-layer Manhattan-diagonal (MD) model with tracks in horizontal, vertical, and ± 45° directions. First, anO(l.d) time algorithm is presented for routing a straight channel of lengthland densitydwithno cyclic vertical constraints. It is shown that the number of trackshused by the algorithm for routingmultiterminal netssatisfiesd≤h≤ (d+ 1). Second, an output-sensitive algorithm is reported that can route a channel withcyclic vertical constraintsinO(l.h) time usinghtracks, allowingoverlappingof wire segments in two layers. Next, the routing problem for a multiterminal L-channel of lengthland heighthis solved by anO(l.h) time algorithm. If no cyclic vertical constraints exist, its time complexity reduces toO(l.d) wheredis the density of the L-channel. Finally, the switchbox routing problem in the MD model is solved elegantly. These techniques, easily extendible to the routing of staircase channels, yield efficient solutions to detailed routing in general floorplans. Experimental results on benchmarks show significantly low via count and reduced wire length, thus establishing the superiority of MD routing to classical strategies. The proposed algorithms are also potentially useful for general non-Manhattan area routing and multichip modules (MCMs).
