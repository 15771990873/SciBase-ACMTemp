Placement is key issue of integrated circuit physical design. There exist some techniques inspired in thermodynamics coping with this problem as Simulated Annealing. In this article, we present a combinatorial optimization method directly derived from both Thermodynamics and Information Theory. In TCO (Thermodynamic Combinatorial Optimization), two kinds of processes are considered: microstate and macrostate transformations. Applying the Shannon's definition of entropy to reversible microstate transformations, a probability of acceptance based on Fermi--Dirac statistics is derived. On the other hand, applying thermodynamic laws to macrostate transformations, an efficient annealing schedule is provided. TCO has been compared with a custom Simulated Annealing (SA) tool on a set of benchmark circuits for the FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) placement problem. TCO has provided the high-quality results of SA, while inheriting the adaptive properties of Natural Optimization (NO).
