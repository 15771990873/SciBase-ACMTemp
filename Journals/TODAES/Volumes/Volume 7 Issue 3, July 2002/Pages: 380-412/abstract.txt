As hardware designs get increasingly complex and time-to-market constraints get tighter there is strong motivation for high-level synthesis (HLS). HLS must efficiently handle both dataflow-dominated and controlflow-dominated designs as well as designs of a mixed nature. In the past efficient tools for the former type have been developed but so far HLS of conditional behaviors lags behind. To bridge this gap an efficient scheduling heuristic for conditional behaviors is presented. Our heuristic and the techniques it utilizes are based on a unifying design representation appropriate for both types of behavioral descriptions, enabling the proposed heuristic to exploit under the same framework several well-established techniques (chaining, multicycling) as well as conditional resource sharing and speculative execution which are essential in efficiently scheduling conditional behaviors. Preliminary experiments confirm the effectiveness of our approach and prompted the development of the CODESIS HLS tool for further experimentation.
