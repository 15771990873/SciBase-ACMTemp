While recent literature on circuit layout addresses large-scale standard-cell placement, the authors typically assume that all macros are fixed. Floorplanning techniques are very good at handling macros, but do not scale to hundreds of thousands of placeable objects. Therefore we combine floorplanning techniques with placement techniques to solve the more general placement problem. Our work shows how to place macros consistently with large numbers of small standard cells. Proposed techniques can also be used to guide circuit designers who prefer to place macros by hand.We address the computational difficulty of layout problems involving large macros and numerous small logic cells at the same time. Proposed algorithms are evaluated in the context of wirelength minimization because a computational method that is not scalable in optimizing wirelength is unlikely to be successful for more complex objectives (congestion, delay, power, etc.)We propose several different design flows to place mixed-size placement instances. The first flow relies on an arbitrary black-box standard-cell placer to obtain an initial placement and then removes possible overlaps using a fixed-outline floorplanner. This results in valid placements for macros, which are considered fixed. Remaining standard cells are then placed by another call to the standard-cell placer. In the second flow a standard-cell placer generates an initial placement and a force-directed placer is used in the engineering change order (ECO) mode to generate an overlap-free placement. Empirical evaluation onibmbenchmarks shows that in most cases our proposed flows compare favorably with previously published mixed-size placers, Kraftwerk, and the mixed-size floor-placer proposed at the 2003 Conference on Design, Automation, and Test in Europe (DATE 2003), and are competitive with mPG-MS.
