Phase shifters are used to shift the bit sequences produced by the successive stages of a built-in test pattern generator (TPG) based on a linear finite state machine (LFSM) by a specified amount (phase shift) relative to the characteristic sequence. An upper bound on the number of taps to be used for each phase shifter and a lower bound on the phase-shift value between successive stages of the TPG mechanism are the general parameters of the problem. Methods to design such phase shifters have been given in the past separately for Type-1 LFSRs, Type-2 LFSRs, and three-neighborhood cellular automata. In this article, we show how phase shifters can be synthesized uniformly and efficiently for any LFSM, including the aforementioned ones. We demonstrate the method by showing how to obtain phase shifters for two-dimensional cellular automata and for ring generators.
