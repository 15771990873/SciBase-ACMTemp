Minimum area is one of the important objectives in technology mapping for lookup table-based field-progrmmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Although there is an algorithm that can find an optimal solution in polynomial time for the minimal-area FPGA technology mapping problem without gate duplication, its time complexity can grow exponentially with the number of inputs of the lookup-tables. This article proposes an algorithm with approximate to the area-optimal solution and lower time complexity. The time complexity of this algorithm is proven theoretically to be bounded byO(n3), wherenis the total number of gates in the given circuit. It is shown that except for some cases the proposed algorithm can find an optimal solution of a given problem. We have combined the proposed algorithm with the existing postprocessing procedures which are used to find the gates that can be duplicated on a set of benchmark examples. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.
