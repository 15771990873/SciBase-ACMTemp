This article addresses the problem of minimizing the implementation cost of the time-multiplexed constant multiplication (TMCM) operation that realizes the multiplication of an input variable by a single constant selected from a set of multiple constants at a time. It presents an efficient algorithm, calledorpheus, that finds a multiplierless TMCM design by sharing logic operators, namely adders, subtractors, adders/subtractors, and multiplexors (MUXes). Moreover, this article introduces folded design architectures for the digital signal processing (DSP) blocks, such as finite impulse response (FIR) filters and linear DSP transforms, and describes how these folded DSP blocks can be efficiently realized using TMCM operations optimized byorpheus. Experimental results indicate thatorpheuscan find better solutions than existing TMCM algorithms, yielding TMCM designs requiring less area. They also show that the folded architectures lead to alternative designs with significantly less area, but incurring an increase in latency and energy consumption, compared to the parallel architecture.
