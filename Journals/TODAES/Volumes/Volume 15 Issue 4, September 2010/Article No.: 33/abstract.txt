Interconnect dominated electronic design stimulates a demand for developing circuits on the third dimension, leading to 3-D integration. Recent advances in chip fabrication technology enable 3-D circuit manufacturing. However, there is still a possible barrier of design complexity in exploiting 3-D technologies. This article discusses the impact of migrating from 2-D to 3-D on the difficulty of floorplanning and placement. By looking at a basic formulation of the graph cuboidal dual problem, we show that the 3-D cases and the 3-layer 2.5-D cases are fundamentally more difficult than the 2-D cases in terms of computational complexity. By comparison among these cases, the intrinsic complexity in 3-D floorplan structures is revealed in the hard-to-decide relations between topological connections and geometrical contacts. The results show possible challenges in the future for physical design and CAD of 3-D integrated circuits.
