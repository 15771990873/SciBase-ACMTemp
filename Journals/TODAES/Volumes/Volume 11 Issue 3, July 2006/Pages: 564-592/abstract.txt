Continuous advancements in semiconductor technology enable the design of complex systems-on-chips (SoCs) composed of tens or hundreds of IP cores. At the same time, the applications that need to run on such platforms have become increasingly complex and have tight power and performance requirements. Achieving a satisfactory design quality under these circumstances is only possible when both computation and communication refinement are performed efficiently, in an automated and synergistic manner. Consequently, formal and disciplined system-level design methodologies are in great demand for future multiprocessor design. This article provides a broad overview of some fundamental research issues and state-of-the-art solutions concerning both computation and communication aspects of system-level design. The methodology we advocate consists of developing abstract application and platform models, followed by application mapping onto the target platform, and then optimizing the overall system via performance analysis. In addition, a communication refinement step is critical for optimizing the communication infrastructure in this multiprocessor setup. Finally, simulation and prototyping can be used for accurate performance evaluation purposes.
