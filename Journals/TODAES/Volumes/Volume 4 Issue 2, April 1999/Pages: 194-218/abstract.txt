This paper presents BIFEST, an ATPG system that employs the built-in intermediate voltage test technique in an efficient ATPG process to deal with CMOS bridging faults. Fast and accurate calculations of the intermediate bridging voltages and the variant threshold tolerance margins on a resistive bridging fault model are presented. A PODEM-like, PPSFP-based ATPG process is developed to generate test patterns for faults that are conventionally logic-testable. The remaining faults are then dealt with by special circuits, called built-in intermediate voltage sensors (BIVSs). By this methodology, almost the same fault coverage as that employingIDDQtesting can be achieved with only logic monitoring required.
