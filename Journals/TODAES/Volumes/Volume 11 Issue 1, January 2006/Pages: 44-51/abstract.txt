This article focuses on the formulation of the substrate resistive coupling using boundary element methods, specifically for substrates without grounded backplates (floating substrates). An accurate and numerically stable formulation is presented. Numerical results are shown to demonstrate the correctness and the numerical robustness of the formulation.
