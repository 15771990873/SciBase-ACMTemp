In low-power design for battery-driven portable applications, the reduction of peak power, peak power differential, cycle difference power, average power and energy are equally important. These are different forms of dynamic power dissipation of a CMOS circuit, which is predominant compared to static power dissipation for higher switching activity. The peak power, the cycle difference power, and the peak power differential drive the transient characteristic of a CMOS circuit. In this article, we propose an ILP-based framework for the reduction of energy and transient power through datapath scheduling during behavioral synthesis. A new metric called “modified cycle power function” (CPF&ast;) is defined that captures the above power characteristics and facilitates integer linear programming formulations. The ILP-based datapath scheduling schemes with CPF&ast; as objective function are developed assuming three modes of datapath operation, such as, single supply voltage and single frequency (SVSF), multiple supply voltages and dynamic frequency clocking (MVDFC), and multiple supply voltages and multicycling (MVMC). We conducted experiments on selected high-level synthesis benchmark circuits for various resource constraints and estimated power, energy and energy delay product for each of them. Experimental results show that significant reductions in power, energy and energy delay product can be obtained.
