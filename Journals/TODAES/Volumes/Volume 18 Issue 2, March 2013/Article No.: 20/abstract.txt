A system ist/t-diagnosable if, given any collection of test results, the faulty nodes can be isolated to within a set of at mosttnodes provided that the number of faulty nodes does not exceedt. Given anN-vertex graphGthat is regular with the common degreedand has no cycle of three or four vertices, this study shows thatGis(2d − 2)/(2d − 2)-diagnosable ifN≥ 4d− 30 > 0. Based on this result, thet/t-diagnosabilities of several classes of graphs can be computed efficiently.
