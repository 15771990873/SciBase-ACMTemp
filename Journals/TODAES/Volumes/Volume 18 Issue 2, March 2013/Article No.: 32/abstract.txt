We present the core elements of BonnRoute: advanced data structures and algorithms for fast and high-quality routing in modern technologies. Global routing is based on a combinatorial approximation scheme for min-max resource sharing. Detailed routing uses exact shortest path algorithms, based on a shape-based data structure for pin access and a two-level track-based data structure for long-distance connections. All algorithms are very fast. Compared to an industrial router (on 32 nm and 22 nm chips), BonnRoute is over two times faster, has 5 &percnt; less netlength, 20 &percnt; less vias, and reduces detours by more than 90 &percnt;.
