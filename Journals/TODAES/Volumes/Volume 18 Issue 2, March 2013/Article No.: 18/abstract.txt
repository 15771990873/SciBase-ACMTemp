Multicore System-on-Chip (SoC) implementations of embedded systems are becoming very popular. In these systems it is possible to spread out computations over many cores. On one hand this leads to better energy efficiency if clock frequencies and core voltages are reduced. On the other hand this delivers very high performance to the software developer and thus enables complex software systems to be implemented. Unfortunately, debugging and validation of these systems becomes extremely difficult. Various technological approaches try to solve this dilemma. In this contribution we will show a new approach to observe multi-core SoCs and make their internal operations visible to external analysis tools. Also, we show that runtime verification can be employed to analyze and validate these internal operations while the system operates in its normal environment. The combination of these two approaches delivers unprecedented options to the developer to understand and verify system behavior even in complex multicore SoCs.
