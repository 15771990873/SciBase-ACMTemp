In this article, we propose a symbolic simulation method where Boolean functions can be efficiently manipulated through a 2-domain partitioned OBDD data structure. The functional partition is applied by automatically exploring the key decision points implicitly built inside a circuit. The partition can help to significantly reduce the OBDD sizes, solving problems that could not be solved with monolithic OBDD data structure. We demonstrate the performance of the approach through the symbolic simulation of several benchmark circuits with complex control logics and datapath. The symbolic simulation based on 2-domain partitioned OBDD can be also applied in equivalence checking. It can generate the signature of functions to identify the critical partition points in the optimized gate-level netlist.
