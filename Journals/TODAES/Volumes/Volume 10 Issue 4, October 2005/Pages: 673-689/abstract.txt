TIS is an instruction-level methodology for processor core self-testing that enhances instruction set of a CPU with test instructions. Since the functionality of test instructions is the same as the NOP instruction, NOP instructions can be replaced with test instructions. Online testing can be accomplished without any performance penalty. TIS tests different parts of the processor and detects stuck-at faults. This method can be employed in offline and online testing of single-cycle, multicycle and pipelined processors. But, TIS is more appropriate for online testing of pipelined architectures in which NOP instructions are frequently executed because of data, control and structural hazards. Running test instructions instead of these NOP instructions, TIS utilizes the time that is otherwise wasted by NOPs. In this article, two different implementations of TIS are presented. One implementation employs a dedicated hardware modules for test vector generation, while the other is a software-based approach that reads test vectors from memory. These two approaches are implemented on a pipelined processor core and their area overheads are compared. To demonstrate the appropriateness of the TIS test technique, several programs are executed and fault coverage results are presented.
