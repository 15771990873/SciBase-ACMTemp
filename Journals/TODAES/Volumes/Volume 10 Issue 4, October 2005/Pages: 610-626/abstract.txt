In this article, we present techniques for comparison between behavioral level and register transfer level (RTL) design descriptions by mapping the designs into virtual controllers and virtual datapaths. We also discuss about how the equivalence between behavioral level and RTL designs can be defined precisely using the proposed “attribute statements” in an interactive fashion. Implementation issues as well as considerations on real life industrial design examples are also presented.
