As design processes continue to increase in complexity it is important to base process-improvement decisions on quantitative analysis. We describe the development of an analytical approach for evaluating sequential design-process completion time and for determining the sensitivities of design time with respect to individual task durations and transition probabilities. Techniques are also detailed for collecting process metadata and calibrating a design proecess model. Example applications illustrate the use of the methodology in analyzing and improving software and hardware design processes.
