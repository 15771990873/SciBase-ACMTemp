Previous forms of LFSR reseeding have been static (i.e., test application is stopped while each seed is loaded) and have required full reseeding (i.e., the length of the seed is equal to the length of the LFSR). A new form of LFSR reseeding is described here that is dynamic (i.e., the seed is incrementally modified while test application proceeds) and allows partial reseeding (i.e. length of the seed is less than that of the LFSR). In addition to providing better encoding efficiency, partial dynamic LFSR reseeding has a simpler hardware implementation than previous schemes based on multiple-polynomial LFSRs.
