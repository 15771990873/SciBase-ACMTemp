Embedded microprocessor cores are increasingly being used in embedded and mobile devices. The software running on these embedded microprocessor cores is often a priori known; thus, there is an opportunity for customizing the cache subsystem for improved performance. In this work, we propose an efficient algorithm to directly compute cache parameters satisfying desired performance criteria. Our approach avoids simulation and exhaustive exploration, and, instead, relies on an exact algorithmic approach. We demonstrate the feasibility of our algorithm by applying it to a large number of embedded system benchmarks.
