Segmented channel routing is fundamental to the routing of row-based FPGAs. In this paper, we study segmented channel routability via satisfiability. Our method encodes the horizontal and vertical constraints of the routing problem as Boolean conditions. The routability constraint is satisfiable if and only if the net connections in the segmented channel are routable. Empirical results show that the method is time-efficient and applicable to large problem instances.
