Skewed logic circuits belong to a noise-tolerant high-performance static circuit family. Skewed logic circuits can achieve performance comparable to that of Domino logic circuits but with much lower power consumption. Two factors contribute to the reduction in power. First, by exploiting the static nature of skewed logic circuits, we can alleviate the cost of logic duplication which is typically required to overcome the logic reconvergence problem in both Domino logic and skewed logic circuits. Second, a selective clocking scheme can be applied to a skewed logic circuit to reduce the clock load and hence, clock power. In this article, we propose a two-step synthesis scheme of skewed logic circuits. In the first step, an integer linear programming-based approach is presented to overcome the logic reconvergence problem in skewed logic circuits with minimal logic duplication cost. In the second step, a dynamic programming-based heuristic is applied to achieve an optimal selective clocking scheme. Experimental results show that the average power saving of skewed logic circuits over Domino logic circuits is 41.1&percent;.
