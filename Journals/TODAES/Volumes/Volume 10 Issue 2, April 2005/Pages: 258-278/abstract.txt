Scan-based transition tests are added to improve the detection of speed failures in sequential circuits. Empirical data suggests that both data volume and application time will increase dramatically for such transition testing. Techniques to address the above problem for a class of transition tests, called enhanced transition tests, are proposed in this article.The first technique, which combines the proposed transition test chains with the ATE repeat capability, reduces test data volume by 46.5&percent; when compared with transition tests computed by a commercial transition test ATPG tool. However, the test application time may sometimes increase. To address the test time issue, a new DFT technique, Exchange Scan, is proposed. Exchange scan reduces both data volume and application time by 46.5&percent;. These techniques rely on the use of hold-scan cells and highlight the effectiveness of hold-scan design to address test time and test data volume issues. In addition, we address the problem of yield loss due to incidentalovertestingof functionally-untestable transition faults, and we formulate an efficient adjustment to the algorithm to keep the overtest ratio low. Our experimental results show that up to 14.5&percent; reduction in overtest ratio can be achieved, with an average overtest reduction of 4.68&percent;.
