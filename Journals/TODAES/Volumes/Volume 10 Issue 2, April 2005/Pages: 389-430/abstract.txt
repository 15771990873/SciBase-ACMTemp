Placement is one of the most important steps in the RTL-to-GDSII synthesis process, as it directly defines the interconnects, which have become the bottleneck in circuit and system performance in deep submicron technologies. The placement problem has been studied extensively in the past 30 years. However, recent studies show that existing placement solutions are surprisingly far from optimal. The first part of this tutorial summarizes results from recent optimality and scalability studies of existing placement tools. These studies show that the results of leading placement tools from both industry and academia may be up to 50&percent; to 150&percent; away from optimal in total wirelength. If such a gap can be closed, the corresponding performance improvement will be equivalent to several technology-generation advancements. The second part of the tutorial highlights the recent progress on large-scale circuit placement, including techniques for wirelength minimization, routability optimization, and performance optimization.
