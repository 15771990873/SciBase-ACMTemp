This article presents an algorithm that substantially reduces the computational effort required to obtain the exact solution to the Resource Constrained Scheduling (RCS) problem. The reduction is obtained by (a) using a branch-and-bound search technique, which computes both upper and lower bounds, and (b) using efficient techniques to accurately estimate the possible time-steps at which each operation can be scheduled and using this to prune the search space. Results on several benchmarks with varying resource constraints indicate the clear superiority of the algorithm presented here over traditional approaches using integer linear programming, with speed-ups of several orders of magnitude.
