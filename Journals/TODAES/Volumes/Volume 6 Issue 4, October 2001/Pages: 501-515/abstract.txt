We report a register transfer level technique for concurrent error detection and diagnosis in data dominated designs calledIntrospection. Introspection uses idle computation cyles in the data path and idle data transfer cycles in the interconnection network in a synergistic fashion for concurrent error detection and diagnosis (CEDD). The resulting on-chip fault latencies are one ten-thousandth (10-4) of previously reported system level concurrent error detection and diagnosis latencies. The associated area overhead and performance penalty are negligible. We derive a cost function that considers introspection constraints such as (i) executing an operation on three disjoint function units for diagnosis and (ii) promoting function units to participate in at least one CEDD operation. We formulate integration of introspection constraints into the operation-to-operator binding phase of high-level synthesis as a weighted bipartite matching problem. The effectiveness of introspection and its implementation are illustrated on numerous industrial strength benchmarks.
