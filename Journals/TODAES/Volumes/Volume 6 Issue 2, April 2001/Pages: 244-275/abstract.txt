In this paper we address the problem of verifying the equivalence of two sequential circuits. State-of-the-art sequential optimization techniques such as retiming and sequential redundancy removal can handle designs with up to hundreds or even thousands of flip-flops. However, the BDD-based approaches for verifying sequential equivalence can easily run into memory explosion for such designs. In an attempt to handle larger circuits, we modify test pattern-generation techniques for verification. The suggested approach utilizes the popular efficient backward-justification technique used in most sequential ATPG programs. We present several techniques to enhance the efficiency of this approach by (1) identifying equivalent flip-flop pairs using an induction-based algorithm, and (2)  generalizing the idea of exploring the structural similarity between circuits to perform verification in stages. This ATPG-based framework is suitable for verifying circuits either with or without a reset state. In order to extend this approach to verify retimed circuits, we introduce a delay-compensation-based algorithm for preprocessing the circuits. The experimental results of verifying the correctness of circuits after sequential redundancy removal and retiming with up to several hundred flip-flops are presented.
