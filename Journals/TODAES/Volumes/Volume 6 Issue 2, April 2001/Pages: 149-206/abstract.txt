We present a survey of the state-of-the-art techniques used in performing data and memory-related optimizations in embedded systems. The optimizations are targeted directly or indirectly at the memory subsystem, and impact one or more out of three important cost metrics: area, performance, and power dissipation of the resulting implementation.We first examine architecture-independent optimizations in the form of code transoformations. We next cover a broad spectrum of optimization techniques that address memory architectures at varying levels of granularity, ranging from register files to on-chip memory, data caches, and dynamic memory (DRAM). We end with memory addressing related issues.
