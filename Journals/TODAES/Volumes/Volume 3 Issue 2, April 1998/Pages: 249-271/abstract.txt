This paper presents a new approach for diagnosing shorts in interconnects in which the adjacencies between nets are known. This structural approach exploits different graph coloring techniques to generate a test set with no aliasing and confounding, i.e., full diagnosis (detection and location) is accomplished. Initially, a simple coloring approach based on a greedy condition of the adjacency graph is proposed for fault detection. Then, the conditions for aliasing and confounding are analyzed with respect to the sizes of the possible shorts. These results are used to generate new colors using a process called color mixing. Color mixing guarantees that additional tests, required in order to avoid aliasing/confounding, will use appropriate codes. The characteristics of unbalanced/balanced codes for encoding the colors in the vector-generation process of interconnect diagnosis are discussed and are proved to yield full diagnosis using a novel method. An algorithm for full diagnosis is then presented; this algorithm has an execution complexity ofO(max{N2,NÃ—D3}) whereNis the number of nets andDis the maximum degree of the nodes in the adjacency graph. Simulation results show that the proposed approach requires a smaller number of test vectors than previous approaches.
