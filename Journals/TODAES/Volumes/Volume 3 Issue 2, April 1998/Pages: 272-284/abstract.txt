This paper proposes a technique for estimating the storage requirements of the Rectangular Corner Stitching (RCS) data structure [Ousterhout 1984] and the  L-shaped Corner Stitching (LCS) data structure [Mehta and Blust 1997] on a given circuit by studying its (the circuit's) geometric properties. This provides a method for estimating the storage requirements of a circuit without having to implement the corner stitching data structure, which is a tedious and time-consuming task. This technique can also be used to estimate the amount of space saved by employing the LCS data structure over the RCS data structure on a given circuit.
