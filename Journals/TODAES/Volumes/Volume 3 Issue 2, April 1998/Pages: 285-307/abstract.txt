This paper analyzes the effect of resource sharing and assignment on the clock period of the synthesized circuit. The assignment phase assigns or binds operations of the scheduled behavioral description to a set of allocated resources. We focus on control-flow intensive descriptions, characterized by the presence of mutually exclusive paths due to the presence of nested conditional branches and loops.We show that clustering multiple operations in the same state of the schedule, possibly leading to chaining of functional units (FUs) in the RTL circuit, is an effective way to minimize the total number of clock cycles, and hence total execution time. We present an assignment algorithm that is particularly effective for such design styles by minimizing data chaining and hence  the clock period of the circuit, thereby leading to further reduction in total execution time.Existing resource sharing and assignment approaches for reducing the clock period of the resulting circuit either increase the resource allocation or use faster modules, both leading to leading to larger area requirements. In this paper we show that even when the type of available resource units and the number of resource units of each type is fixed, different assignments may lead to circuits with significant differences in clock period.We provide a comprehensive analysis of how resource sharing and assignment introduces long paths in the circuit. Based on the analysis, we develop an assignment algorithm that uses a high-level delay estimator to asign operations to a fixed  set of available resources so as to minimize the clock period of the resultant circuit, with no or minimal effect on the area of the circuit. Experimental results on several conditional-intensive designs demonstrate the effectiveness of the assignment algorithm.
