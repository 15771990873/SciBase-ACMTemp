We present an approach for accelerating the validation speed of behavioral system descriptions through hardware emulation. The method allows source-level debuggingof running hardware specified in behavioral VH DL in a way similar to sorce-leve debugging in software programing languages. We discuss breakpoints in source-level emulation and how the circuit generated by high-level synthesis has to be modified to work with breakpoints. Breakpoint encoding and detection are shown in detail. Our approach allows breakpoint detection by hardware with seriously slowing the circuit or dramitically increasing its size.
