While sizing has been studied for over three decades, the absence of a common framework with which to compare methods has made progress difficult to measure. In this article, we compare popular sizing techniques in which gates are chosen from a discrete standard cell library and slew and interconnect effects are accounted for. The difference between sizing methods reduces from roughly 53&percnt; to 8&percnt; between best and worst case after slew propagation is taken into account. In our benchmarks, no one sizing technique consistently outperforms the others.
