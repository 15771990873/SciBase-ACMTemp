In this article, we provide a fresh viewpoint to the interactions between clock skew scheduling and delay insertion. A race-condition-aware (RCA) clock skew scheduling is proposed to determine the clock skew schedule by taking race conditions (i.e., hold violations) into account. Our objective is not only to optimize the clock period, but also to minimize heuristically the required inserted delay. Compared with previous work, our major contribution includes the following two aspects. First, our approach achieves exactly the same results, but has significant improvement in time complexity. Second, our viewpoint can be generalized to other sequential timing optimization techniques.
