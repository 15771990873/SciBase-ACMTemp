Multi-level cell (MLC) phase change RAM (PRAM) is expected to offer lower cost main memory than DRAM. However, poor write performance is one of the most critical problems for practical applications of MLC PRAM. In this article, we present two schemes to improve write performance by controlling the target resistance distribution of MLC PRAM cells. First, we propose multiple RESET/SET operations that relax the target resistance bands of intermediate logic levels with additional RESET/SET operations, which reduces the program time of intermediate logic levels, thereby improving write performance. Second, we propose a two-step write scheme consisting of lightweight write and idle-time completion write that exploits the fact that hot dirty data tend to be overwritten in a short time period and the MLC PRAM often has long idle times. Experimental results show that the multiple RESET/SET and two-step write schemes result in an average IPC improvement of 15.7&percnt; and 10.4&percnt;, respectively, on a hybrid DRAM/PRAM main memory subsystem. Furthermore, their integrated solution results in an average IPC improvement of 23.2&percnt; (up to 46.4&percnt;).
