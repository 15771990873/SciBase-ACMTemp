As the size and complexity of current VLSI circuits grows, faster power grid simulation is becoming more and more desirable. In this article, we present a parallel iterative method for static VLSI power grid simulation. In the proposed enlarged-partition-based preconditioned conjugate gradient (EPPCG) power grid solver, the power grid is divided into disjoint partitions that are subsequently enlarged to obtain accurate solution within each partition. The global solution obtained by solving enlarged partition problems concurrently acts as a highly effective parallel preconditioner. The combination of effective preconditioning and efficient parallelization helps achieve very high performance. The experiments show that our parallel implementation can achieve significant speed improvement [61X--142X] over a state-of-the-art direct solver.
