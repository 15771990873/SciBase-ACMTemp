In enhanced-scan circuits, a two-pattern test <ti,tj> for a transition fault can be obtained by using a testtjthat detects a stuck-at fault, and preceding it by a testtithat activates another stuck-at fault. Thus, test generation for transition faults can be done by combining pairs of stuck-at tests. This provides an alternative to deterministic test generation, as well as reduces the test storage requirements for transition fault tests. We study the possibility of generating scan-based tests for transition faults in standard-scan circuits in a similar way, by combining pairs of stuck-at tests. Since it is not always possible to obtain a standard-scan test that is equivalent to a two-pattern test <ti,tj> based on stuck-at teststiandtj, it is not always possible to guarantee that the combination oftiandtjwill detect a transition fault. To compensate for this, it is necessary to try combinations of different stuck-at test pairs, resulting in an increased simulation effort to compute effective standard-scan tests. Our focus in this work is on reducing this simulation effort by reducing the number of stuck-at test pairs that need to be considered.
