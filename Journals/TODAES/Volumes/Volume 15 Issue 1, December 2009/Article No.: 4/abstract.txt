The current use of multi-Vtto control leakage power targets combinational gates, even though sequential elements such as flip-flops and latches also contribute appreciable leakage. We can, nevertheless, apply multi-Vtto flip-flops, but few can take advantage of high-Vt, which causes abrupt changes in timing. We combine low- and high-Vtat the transistor level to design mixed-Vtflip-flops with reduced leakage, an unchanged footprint, and a small increase in either setup time or clock-to-Q delay, but not both. An allocation algorithm for twoVts determines theVt(mixed, high, or low) of each flip-flop and theVtof each combinational gate (high or low) in a sequential circuit. Experiments with 65-nm technology show an average leakage saving of 42&percnt; compared to conventional multi-Vtapproaches; the leakage of flip-flops alone is cut by 78&percnt;. This saving is largely unaffected by die-to-die or within-die process variations, which we show through simulations. Standard deviation of leakage caused by process variation is also reduced due to less use of low-Vtdevices. We also extend our approach to threeVts, and obtain a further 14&percnt; reduction in leakage.
