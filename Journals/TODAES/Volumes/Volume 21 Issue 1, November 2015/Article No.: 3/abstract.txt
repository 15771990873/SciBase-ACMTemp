In this article, we demonstrate that the sensitized path delays in various microprocessor pipe stages exhibit intriguing temporal and spatial variations during the execution of real-world applications. To effectively exploit these delay variations, we proposedynamically adaptable resilient pipeline(DARP)â€”a series of runtime techniques to boost power-performance efficiency and fault tolerance in a pipelined microprocessor. DARP employs early error prediction to avoid a major portion of the timing errors. We combine DARP with the state-of-arttopologically homogeneous and power-performance heterogeneous(THPH) architecture to build up a new frontier for the energy efficiency of multicore processors (DARP-MP). Using a rigorous circuit-architectural infrastructure, we demonstrate that DARP substantially improves the multicore processor performance (9.4--20&percnt;) and energy efficiency (10--28.6&percnt;) compared to state-of-the-art techniques. The energy-efficiency improvements of DARP-MP are 42&percnt; and 49.9&percnt; compared against the original THPH and another state-of-art multicore power management scheme, respectively.
