The high density of interconnects, closer proximity of modules, and routing phase are pivotal during the layout of a performance-centricthree-dimensional integrated circuit(3D IC). Heuristic-based approaches are typically used to handle such NP-complete problems of global routing in 3D ICs. To overcome the inherent limitations of deterministic approaches, a novel methodology for multi-objective global routing based on fuzzy logic has been proposed in this article. The guiding information generated after the placement phase is used during routing with the help of a fuzzy expert system to achieve thermally efficient and congestion-free routing. A complete global routing solution is designed based on the proposed algorithms and the results are compared with selected fully established global routers, namely Labyrinth, FastRoute3.0, NTHU-R, BoxRouter 2.0, FGR, NTHU-Route2.0, FastRoute4.0, NCTU-GR, MGR, and NCTU-GR2.0. Experiments are performed over ISPD 1998 and 2008 benchmarks. The proposed router, calledFuzzRoute, achieves balanced superiority in terms of routability, runtime, and wirelength over others. The improvements on routing time for Labyrinth, BoxRouter 2.0, and FGR are 91.81&percnt;, 86.87&percnt;, and 32.16&percnt;, respectively, for ISPD 1998 benchmarks. It may be noted that, though FastRoute3.0 achieves fastest runtime, it fails to generate congestion-free solutions for all benchmarks, which is overcome by the proposed FuzzRoute of the current article. It also shows wirelength improvements of 17.35&percnt;, 2.88&percnt;, 2.44&percnt;, 2.83&percnt;, and 2.10&percnt;, respectively, over others for ISPD 1998 benchmarks. For ISPD 2008 benchmark circuits it also provides 2.5&percnt;, 2.6&percnt;, 1 &percnt;, 1.1&percnt;, and 0.3&percnt; lesser wirelength and averagely runs 1.68×, 6.42×, 2.21×, 0.76×, and 1.54× faster than NTHU-Route2.0, FastRoute4.0, NCTU-GR, MGR, and NCTU-GR2.0, respectively.
