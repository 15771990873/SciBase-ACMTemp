Fast allocation of large blocks of physically contiguous memory plays a crucial role to boost the performance of multimedia applications in modern memory-constrained portable devices, such as smartphones, tablets, etc. Existing systems have addressed this issue by provisioning a largestatically reserved memory area(SRA) in which only dedicated applications can allocate pages. However, this in turn degrades the performance of applications that are prohibited to utilize the SRA due to the reduced available memory pool. To overcome this drawback while maintaining the benefits of the SRA, we propose a new memory management scheme that uses a special memory region, calledpage-cache-preferred area(PCPA), in concert with a quick memory reclaiming algorithm. The key of the proposed scheme is to enhance the memory utilization efficiency by enabling to allocate page-cached pages of all applications in the PCPA until predetermined applications require to allocate big chunks of contiguous memory. At this point, clean page-cached pages in the PCPA are rapidly evicted without write-back to a secondary storage. Compared to the SRA scheme, experimental results show that the average launch time of real-world applications and the execution time of I/O-intensive benchmarks are reduced by 9.2&percnt; and 24.7&percnt;, respectively.
