In this article, we address both security and safety requirements and solve security-aware design problems for the controller area network (CAN) protocol and time division multiple access (TDMA)-based protocols. To provide insights and guidelines for other similar security problems with limited resources and strict timing constraints, we propose a general security-aware design methodology to address security with other design constraints in a holistic framework and optimize design objectives. The security-aware design methodology is further applied to solve a security-aware design problem for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications with dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) technology. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches in system design without violating design constraints and indicate that it is necessary to consider security together with other metrics during design stages.
