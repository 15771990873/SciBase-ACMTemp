This paper describes a synthesis technique for automating the design of linear Digital Signal Processing (DSP) systems such as digital filters. The proposed methodology makes optimized use of saturation arithmetic to produce a small design implemented directly in hardware. An analytical technique is proposed to estimate the saturation error resulting from a particular implementation, and an optimization procedure is introduced to aim for the smallest implementation satisfying user-specified bounds on saturation and roundoff error. Results are presented illustrating significant speedup and area reduction compared with standard DSP design techniques: up to 22&percnt; improvement in area and 28&percnt; improvement in speed have been obtained on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) implementations.
