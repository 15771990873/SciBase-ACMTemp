An increasingly time-consuming part of the design flow of on-chip multiprocessors is the simulation of the interconnect architecture. The accurate simulation of state-of-the art network-on-chip interconnects can take hours, and this process is repeated for each design iteration because it provides valuable insights on communication latencies that can greatly affect the overall performance of the system. In this article, we identify a time-predictable network-on-chip architecture and show that its timing behaviour can be predicted using models which are far less complex than the architecture itself. We then explore such a feature to produce simplified and lightweight simulation models that can produce latency figures with more than 90&percnt; accuracy and simulate more than 1,000 times faster when compared to a cycle-accurate model of the same interconnect.
