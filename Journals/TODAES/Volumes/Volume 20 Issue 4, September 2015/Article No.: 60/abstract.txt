As fabrication technology scales towards smaller transistor sizes and lower critical charge, single-event radiation effects are more likely to cause errant behavior in multiple, physically adjacent devices in modern integrated circuits (ICs), and with higher operating frequencies, this risk increasingly impacts design logic over memory as well. In order to increase future system reliability, circuit designers need greater awareness of multiple-transient charge-sharing effects during the early stages of their design flow with standard cell placement and routing. To measure the propagation and observability of multiple transients from single radiation events, this work uses several intra-pipeline combinational logic circuits at the 32nm technology node, investigates several different standard cell placements of each design, and analyzes those placements with a novel, physically realistic transient injection and simulation method. It is shown that (1) this simulation methodology, informed by experimental data, provides an increased realism over other works in traditional fault injection fields, (2) different placements of the same circuit where standard cells are grouped by logical hierarchy can result in different reliability behavior and benefits especially useful within the area of approximate computing, and (3) improved reliability through charge-sharing transient mitigation can be gained with no area penalty and minimal speed and power penalties by adjusting the placement of standard cells.
