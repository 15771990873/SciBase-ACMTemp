This article proposes a new online voltage scaling (VS) technique for battery-powered embedded systems with real-time constraints. The VS technique takes into account the execution times and discharge currents of tasks to further reduce the battery charge consumption when compared to the recently reported slack forwarding technique [Ahmed and Chakrabarti 2004], while maintaining low online complexity ofO(1). Furthermore, we investigate the impact of online rescheduling and remapping on the battery charge consumption for tasks with data dependency which has not been explicitly addressed in the literature and propose a novel rescheduling/remapping technique. Finally, we take leakage power into consideration and extend the proposed online techniques to include adaptive body biasing (ABB) which is used to reduce the leakage power. We demonstrate and compare the efficiency of the presented techniques using seven real-life benchmarks and numerous automatically generated examples.
