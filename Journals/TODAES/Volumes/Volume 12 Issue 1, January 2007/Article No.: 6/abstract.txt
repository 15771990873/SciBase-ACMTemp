In multiprocessor-based SoCs, optimizing the communication architecture is often as important, if not more important, than optimizing the computation architecture. While there are mature platforms and techniques for the modeling and evaluation of architectures of processing elements, the same is not true for the communication architectures. This article presents an application-driven retargetable prototyping platform that fills this gap. This environment aims to facilitate the design exploration of the communication subsystem through application-level execution-driven simulations and quantitative analysis. Based on an analysis of a wide range of on-chip communication architectures, we describe how a specific hierarchical class library can be used to develop new on-chip communication architectures, or variants of existing ones with relatively little incremental effort. We demonstrate this through three case studies including two commercial on-chip bus systems and an on-chip packet switching network. Here we show that, through careful analysis and construction, it is possible for the modeling environment to support the common features of these architectures as part of the library and permit instantiation of the individual architectures as variants of the library design. Consequently, system-level design choices regarding the communication architecture can be made with high confidence in the early stages of design. In addition to improving design quality, this methodology also results in significantly shortening design-time.
