The objective of this article is to introduce the use of Stochastic Automata Networks (SANs) as an effective formalism for application-architecture modeling in system-level average-case analysis for platform-based design. By platform, we mean a family of heterogeneous architectures that satisfy a set of architectural constraints imposed to allow re-use of hardware and software components. More precisely, we show how SANs can be used early in the design cycle to identify the best performance/power trade-offs among several application-architecture combinations. Having this information available not only helps avoid lengthy simulations for predicting power and performance figures, but also enables efficient mapping of different applications onto a chosen platform. We illustrate the benefits of our methodology by using the “Picture-in-Picture” video decoder as a driver application.
