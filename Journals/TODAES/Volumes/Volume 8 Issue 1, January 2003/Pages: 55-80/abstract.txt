Floorplan representation is a fundamental issue in designing a floorplanning algorithm. In this paper, we first present a twin binary trees structure for mosaic floorplans. It is a nonredundant representation. We then derive the exact number of configurations for mosaic floorplans and slicing floorplans. Finally, the relationships between various state-of-the-art floorplan representations are discussed and explored.
