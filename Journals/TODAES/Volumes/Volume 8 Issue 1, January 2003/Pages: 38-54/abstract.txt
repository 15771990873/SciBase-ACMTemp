The concept of bus segmentation has been proposed to minimize power consumption by reducing the switched capacitance on each bus [Chen et al. 1999]. This paper details the design theory and implementation issues of segmented bus systems. Based on a graph model and the Gomory-Hu cut-equivalent tree algorithm, a bus can be partitioned into several bus segments separated by pass transistors. Highly communicating devices are placed to adjacent bus segments, so most data communication can be achieved by switching a small portion of the bus segments. Thus, a significant amount of power consumption can be saved. It can be proved that the proposed bus partitioning method achieves an optimal solution. The concept of tree clustering is also proposed to merge bus segments for further power reduction. The design flow, which includes bus tree construction in the register-transfer level and bus segmentation cell placement and routing in the physical level, is discussed for design implementation. The technology has been applied to a Î¼-controller design, and simulation results by PowerMill show significant improvement in power consumption.
