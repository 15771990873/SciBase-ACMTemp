A productivity-driven methodology for incremental floorplanning is 
described and theconstrained polygon transformation problem, a key step of this methodology, is formulated. The input to the problem consists of a floorplan computed using area estimates and the actual area required for each subcircuit of the floorplan. Informally, the objective is to change the areas of the modules without drastically changing their shapes or locations. We show that the constrained polygon transformation problem is NP-hard and present several fast algorithms that produce results within a few percent of a theoretical lower bound on several floorplans.
