As the sizes of many IC design problems become increasingly larger, 
approximation has become a valuable approach for arriving at satisfactory results without incurring exorbitant computational cost. In this paper, we present several approximation techniques for solvingfloorplan area minimizationproblems. These new techniques enable us to reduce both the time and space complexities of the previously best known approximation algorithms by more than a factor ofnandn2for rectangular and L-shaped subfloorplans, respectively (wherenis the number of given implementions). The improvements in the time and space complexities of such approximation techniques is critical to their applicability in floorplan area minimization algorithms. The techniques are quite general, and may be applicable to other classes of approximation problems.
