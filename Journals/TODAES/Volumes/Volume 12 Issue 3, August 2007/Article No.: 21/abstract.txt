System-level modeling, simulation, and synthesis using electronic design automation (EDA) tools are key steps in the design process for communication and signal processing systems, and the synchronous dataflow (SDF) model of computation is widely used in EDA tools for these purposes. Behavioral representations of modern wireless communication systems typically result incritical SDF graphs: These consist of hundreds of components (or more) and involve complex intercomponent connections with highlymultiraterelationships (i.e., with large variations in average rates of data transfer or component execution across different subsystems). Simulating such systems using conventional SDF scheduling techniques generally leads to unacceptable simulation time and memory requirements on modern workstations and high-end PCs. In this article, we present a novelsimulation-oriented scheduler(SOS) that strategically integrates several techniques for graph decomposition and SDF scheduling to provide effective, joint minimization of time and memory requirements for simulating critical SDF graphs. We have implemented SOS in theadvanced design system(ADS) from Agilent Technologies. Our results from this implementation demonstrate large improvements in simulating real-world, large-scale, and highly multirate wireless communication systems (e.g., 3GPP, Bluetooth, 802.16e, CDMA 2000, XM radio, EDGE, and Digital TV).
