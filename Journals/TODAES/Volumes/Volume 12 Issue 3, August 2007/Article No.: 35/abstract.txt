This article presents the speedups achieved in a generic single-chip microprocessor system by employing a high-performance datapath. The datapath acts as a coprocessor that accelerates computational-intensive kernel sections thereby increasing the overall performance. We have previously introduced the datapath which is composed of Flexible Computational Components (FCCs). These components can realize any two-level template of primitive operations. The automated coprocessor synthesis method from high-level software description and its integration to a design flow for executing applications on the system is presented. For evaluating the effectiveness of our coprocessor approach, analytical study in respect to the type of the custom datapath and to the microprocessor architecture is performed. The overall application speedups of several real-life applications relative to the software execution on the microprocessor are estimated using the design flow. These speedups range from 1.75 to 5.84, with an average value of 3.04, while the overhead in circuit area is small. The design flow achieved the acceleration of the applications near to theoretical speedup bounds. A comparison with another high-performance datapath showed that the proposed coprocessor achieves smaller area-time products by an average of 23&percnt; for the generated datapaths. Additionally, the FCC coprocessor achieves better performance in accelerating kernels relative to software-programmable DSP cores.
