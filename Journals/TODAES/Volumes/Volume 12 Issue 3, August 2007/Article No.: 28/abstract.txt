This article develops circuit-simulated routing algorithms. We model the routing graph by an RC network with terminals as inputs, and show that the faster an output reaches its peak, the higher the possibility for the corresponding Hanan or escape node to become a Steiner point. This enables us to select Steiner points and then apply any minimum spanning tree algorithm to obtain obstacle-free or obstacle-aware Steiner routing. Compared with existing algorithms, our algorithms have significant gain on either wirelength or runtime for obstacle-free routing, and on both wirelength and runtime for obstacle-aware routing.
