A method for register number estimation in unscheduled or partially scheduled dataflow graphs is presented. The strategy consists of studying the probability that an edge between two nodes crosses the boundary between two control steps, and its is based on a model that associates probabilities with the different scheduling alternatives of each node. These probabilities are computed by means of an analytic method that takes into account the distribution of operations in the dataflow graph and the hardware modules available in the library. The results highlight that the estimation method is very accurate becaused the error between the estimated value and the real value is always within a narrow margin.
