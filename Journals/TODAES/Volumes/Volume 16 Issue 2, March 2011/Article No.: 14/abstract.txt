In this article, we focus on solving the energy optimization problem for real-time streaming applications on multiprocessor System-on-Chip by combining task-level coarse-grained software pipelining with DVS (Dynamic Voltage Scaling) and DPM (Dynamic Power Management) considering transition overhead, inter-core communication and discrete voltage levels. We propose a two-phase approach to solve the problem. In the first phase, we propose a coarse-grained task parallelization algorithm called RDAG to transform a periodic dependent task graph into a set of independent tasks by exploiting the periodic feature of streaming applications. In the second phase, we propose a scheduling algorithm, GeneS, to optimize energy consumption. GeneS is a genetic algorithm that can search and find the best schedule within the solution space generated by gene evolution. We conduct experiments with a set of benchmarks from E3S and TGFF. The experimental results show that our approach can achieve a 24.4&percnt; reduction in energy consumption on average compared with the previous work.
