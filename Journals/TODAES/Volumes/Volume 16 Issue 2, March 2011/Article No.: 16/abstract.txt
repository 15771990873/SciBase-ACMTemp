Traditional DVFS schemes are oblivious to fine-grained adaptability resulting from path-grained timing imbalance. With the awareness of such fine-grained adaptability, better power-performance efficiency can be obtained. We propose a new scheme, MicroFix, to exploit such fine-grained adaptability. We first show the potential resulted from the path-grained timing imbalance and then present a new technique, Timing Interpolation, to reap the fine-grained adaptability for power reduction. Moreover, to eliminate the conservative margins of traditional DVFS, unlike the previous approaches such as Razor that reactively handle the delay errors (induced by aggressively scaled voltage/frequcncy) by enabling error detection and recovery, we propose a proactive approach by error prediction, thereby obviate the high-cost recovery routines. MicroFix was evaluated based on ISCAS89 benchmarks and the floating-point unit adopted by OpenSPARC T1 processor. Compared to ideal traditional DVFS schemes, the experimental results show that for most of the evaluated circuits, MicroFix can help saving up to 20&percnt; power consumption without compromising with frequency, at the expense of less than 5&percnt; area overhead. Compared to nonideal DVFS schemes (with 10&percnt; voltage margin), the power reduction can even reach up to 38&percnt; on average.
