The importance of effective and efficient accounting of layout effects is well established in High-Level Synthesis (HLS), since it allows more realistic exploration of the design space and the generation of solutions with predictable metrics. This feature is highly desirable in order to avoid unnecessary iterations through the design process. In this article, we address the problem of layout-driven register-transfer-level (RTL) binding as this step has a direct relevance to the final performance of the design. By producing not only an RTL design but also an approximate physical topology of the chip-level implementation, we ensure that the solution will perform at the predicted metric once implemented, thus avoiding unnecessary delays in the design process.
