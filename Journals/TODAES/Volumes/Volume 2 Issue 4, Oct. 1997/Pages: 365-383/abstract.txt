Continuous advances in processor and ASIC technologies enable the integration of more and more complex embedded systems. Embedded systems have become commonplace in recent years. Since their implementations generally require the use of heterogeneous resources (e.g., processor cores, ASICs) in one system with hard design constraints, the importance of  hardware/software codesign methodologies increases steadily. HW/SW codesign approaches consist generally of HW/SW partitioning and scheduling, constrained code generation, and hardware and interface synthesis. This article presents the codesign of an industrial experiment in acoustic echo cancellation (GMDF&agr; algorithm); and emphasizes the partitioning and communication synthesis steps. This experiment brings to light interesting problems  such as data and program distribution between system memories and the modeling of communications in the partitioning process
