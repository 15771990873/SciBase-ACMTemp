Memories are one of the most widely used elements in electronic systems, and their reliability when exposed to Single Events Upsets (SEUs) has been studied extensively. As transistor sizes shrink, Multiple Bits Upsets (MBUs) are becoming an increasingly important factor in the reliability of memories exposed to radiation effects. To address this issue, Built-in Current Sensors (BICS) have recently been applied in conjunction with Single Error Correction/Double Error Detection (SEC-DED) codes to protect memories from MBUs. In this article, this approach is taken one step further, proposing specific codes optimized to be combined with BICS to provide protection against MBUs in memories. By exploiting the locality of errors within an MBU and the error detection and location capabilities of BICS, the proposed codes result in both a better protection level and a reduced cost compared with the existing SEC-DED approach.
