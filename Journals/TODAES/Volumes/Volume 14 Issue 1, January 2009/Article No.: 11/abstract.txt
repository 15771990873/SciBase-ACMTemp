This article describes several multiplexer-based interconnection strategies designed to improve energy consumption of stripe-based coarse-grain reconfigurable fabrics. Application requirements for the architecture as well as two dense subgraphs are extracted from a suite of signal and image processing benchmarks. These statistics are used to drive the strategy of the composition of multiplexer-based interconnect. The article compares interconnects that are fully connected between stripes, those with a cardinality of 8:1 to 4:1, and extensions that provide a 5:1 cardinality, limited 6:1 cardinality, and hybrids between 5:1 and 3:1 cardinalities. Additionally, dedicated vertical routes are considered replacing some computational units with dedicated pass-gates. Using a fabric interconnect model (FIM) written in XML, we demonstrate that fabric instances and mappers can be automatically generated using a Web-based design flow. Upon testing these instances, we found that using an 8:1 cardinality interconnect with 33&percnt; of the computational units replaced with dedicated pass-gates provided the best energy versus mappability tradeoff, resulting in a 50&percnt; energy improvement over fully connected rows and 20&percnt; energy improvement over an 8:1 cardinality interconnect without dedicated vertical routes.
