Design intent coverageis a formal methodology for analyzing the gap between a formal architectural specification of a design and the formal functional specifications of the component RTL blocks of the design. In this article we extend the design intent coverage methodology to hybrid specifications containing both state-machines and formal properties. We demonstrate the benefits of this extension in two domains of considerable recent interest, namely (a) the use of auxiliary state-machines in formal specifications, and (b) the use of modest sized RTL blocks in the design intent coverage analysis.
