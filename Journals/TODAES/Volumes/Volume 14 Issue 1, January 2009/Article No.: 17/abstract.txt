This article proposes a low-cost, low-power multistandard video decoder for high definition (HD) video applications. The proposed design supports multiple-standard (JPEG baseline, MPEG-1/2/4 Simple Profile (SP), and H.264 Baseline Profile (BP)) video decoding through interactive parsing control and common parameter bus interface. In order to reduce hardware cost, the shared adder-based structure and reusable data management are proposed to achieve hardware sharing and reduce internal memory size, respectively. In addition, the proposed design is optimized through reducing memory bandwidth by increasing both data reuse amount and burst length of memory access as well as eliminating cycle overhead in data access for supporting HD video decoding with single AHB-based SDR memory. The proposed 252Kgates/4.9kB/71mW/0.13Î¼m multi-standard video decoder reduces 72&percnt; in gate count and 87&percnt; in power consumption as compared to the state-of-the-art design, when operating at 120MHz for real-time HD1080 video decoding with single AHB-based SDR memory.
