Reducing management costs and improving the availability of large-scale distributed systems require automatic replicaregeneration, that is, creating new replicas in response to replica failures. A major challenge to regeneration is maintaining consistency when the replica group changes. Doing so is particularly difficult across the wide area where failure detection is complicated by network congestion and node overload.In this context, this article presents Om, the first read/write peer-to-peer, wide-area storage system that achieves high availability and manageability through online automatic regeneration while still preserving consistency guarantees. We achieve these properties through the following techniques. First, by utilizing thelimited view divergenceproperty in today's Internet and by adopting thewitness model, Om is able to regenerate from any single replica, rather than requiring a majority quorum, at the cost of a small (10âˆ’6in our experiments) probability of violating consistency during each regeneration. As a result, Om can deliver high availability with a small number of replicas, while traditional designs would significantly increase the number of replicas. Next, we distinguishfailure-freereconfigurations fromfailure-inducedones, enabling common reconfigurations to proceed with a single round of communication. Finally, we use alease graphamong the replicas and a two-phase write protocol to optimize for reads, so that reads in Om can be processed by any single replica. Experiments on PlanetLab show that consistent regeneration in Om completes in approximately 20 seconds.
