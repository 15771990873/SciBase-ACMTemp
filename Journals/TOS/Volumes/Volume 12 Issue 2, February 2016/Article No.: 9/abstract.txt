The emergence and wide availability of remote storage service providers prompted work in the security community that allows clients to verify integrity and availability of the data that they outsourced to a not fully trusted remote storage server at a relatively low cost. Most recent solutions to this problem allow clients to read and update (i.e., insert, modify, or delete) stored data blocks while trying to lower the overhead associated with verifying the integrity of the stored data. In this work, we develop a novel scheme, performance of which favorably compares with the existing solutions. Our solution additionally enjoys a number of new features, such as a natural support for operations on ranges of blocks, revision control, and support for multiple user access to shared content. The performance guarantees that we achieve stem from a novel data structure called abalanced update treeand removing the need for interaction during update operations in addition to communicating the updates themselves.
