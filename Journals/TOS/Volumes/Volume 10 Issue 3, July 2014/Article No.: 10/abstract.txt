The availability of high-speed solid-state storage has introduced a new tier into the storage hierarchy. Low-latency and high-IOPS solid-state drives (SSDs) cache data in front of high-capacity disks. However, most existing SSDs are designed to be a drop-in disk replacement, and hence are mismatched for use as a cache.This article describesFlashTier, a system architecture built upon asolid-state cache(SSC), which is a flash device with an interface designed for caching. Management software at the operating system block layer directs caching. The FlashTier design addresses three limitations of using traditional SSDs for caching. First, FlashTier provides a unified logical address space to reduce the cost of cache block management within both the OS and the SSD. Second, FlashTier provides a new SSC block interface to enable a warm cache with consistent data after a crash. Finally, FlashTier leverages cache behavior to silently evict data blocks during garbage collection to improve performance of the SSC.We first implement an SSC simulator and a cache manager in Linux to perform an in-depth evaluation and analysis of FlashTier's design techniques. Next, we develop a prototype of SSC on the OpenSSD Jasmine hardware platform to investigate the benefits and practicality of FlashTier design. Our prototyping experiences provide insights applicable to managing modern flash hardware, implementing other SSD prototypes and new OS storage stack interface extensions.Overall, we find that FlashTier improves cache performance by up to 168&percnt; over consumer-grade SSDs and up to 52&percnt; over high-end SSDs. It also improves flash lifetime for write-intensive workloads by up to 60&percnt; compared to SSD caches with a traditional flash interface.
