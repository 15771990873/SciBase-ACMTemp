We present a new disk scheduling framework to address the needs of a shared multimedia service that provides differentiated multilevel quality-of-service for mixed-media workloads. In such a shared service, requests from different users have different associated performance objectives and utilities, in accordance with the negotiated service-level agreements (SLAs). Service providers typically provision resources only for average workload intensity, so it becomes important to handle workload surges in a way that maximizes the utility of the served requests.We capture the performance objectives and utilities associated with these multiclass diverse workloads in a unified framework and formulate the disk scheduling problem as a reward maximization problem. We map the reward maximization problem to a minimization problem on graphs and, by novel use of graph-theoretic techniques, design a scheduling algorithm that is computationally efficient and optimal in the class of seek-optimizing algorithms. Comprehensive experimental studies demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other disk schedulers under all loads, with the performance improvement approaching 100&percnt; under certain high load conditions. In contrast to existing schedulers, the proposed scheduler is extensible to new performance objectives (workload type) and utilities by simply altering the reward functions associated with the requests.
