While flash memory has been widely adopted for storage systems for various embedded systems, issues of performance and reliability have started receiving growing attention in recent years. How to provide efficient roll back and quick mounting for flash-memory file systems has become an important research topic in recent years, in addition to the work on effective garbage collection and superb runtime performance. Such an observation motivates our work on the investigation of efficient initialization and crash recovery of flash-memory file systems based on log structures. A methodology is proposed for the acceleration of mounting and crash recovery for log-based file systems. A system prototype based on a well-known flash-memory file system, YAFFS, was implemented with performance evaluation. Experimental results show that the proposed methodology can reduce mounting time significantly, regardless of whether the file system is properly unmounted.
