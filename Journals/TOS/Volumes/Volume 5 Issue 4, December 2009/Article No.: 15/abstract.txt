We develop a holistic framework for adaptively scheduling asynchronous requests in distributed file systems. The system is holistic in that it manages all resources, including network bandwidth, server I/O, server CPU, and client and server memory utilization. It accelerates, defers, or cancels asynchronous requests in order to improve application-perceived performance directly. We employ congestion pricing via online auctions to coordinate the use of system resources by the file system clients so that they can detect shortages and adapt their resource usage. We implement our modifications in the Congestion-Aware Network File System (CA-NFS), an extension to the ubiquitous network file system (NFS). Our experimental result shows that CA-NFS results in a 20&percnt; improvement in execution times when compared with NFS for a variety of workloads.
