A recent article on the reliability of RAID-6 storage systems overlooks certain relevant prior work published in the past 20 years and concludes that the widely used mean time to data loss (MTTDL) metric does not provide accurate results. In this note, we refute this position by invoking uncited relevant prior work and demonstrating that the MTTDL remains a useful metric.
