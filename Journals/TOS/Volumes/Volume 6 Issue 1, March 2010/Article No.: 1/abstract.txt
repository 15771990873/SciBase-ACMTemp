An emerging storage technology, called MEMS-based storage, promises nonvolatile storage devices with ultrahigh density, high rigidity, a small form factor, and low cost. For these reasons, MEMS-based storage devices are suitable for battery-powered mobile systems such as PDAs. For deployment in such systems, MEMS-based storage devices must consume little energy. This work mainly targets reducing the energy consumption of this class of devices.We derive the operation modes of a MEMS-based storage device and systemically devise a policy in each mode for energy saving. Three types of policies are presented: power management, shutdown, and data-layout policy. Combined, these policies reduce the total energy consumed by a MEMS-based storage device. A MEMS-based storage device that enforces these policies comes close to Flash with respect to energy consumption and response time. However, enhancement on the device level is still needed; we present some suggestions to resolve this issue.
