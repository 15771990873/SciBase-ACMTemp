The problem of statically assigning nonpartitioned files in a parallel I/O system has been extensively investigated. A basic workload characteristic assumption of most existing solutions to the problem is that there exists a strong inverse correlation between file access frequency and file size. In other words, the most popular files are typically small in size, while the large files are relatively unpopular. Recent studies on the characteristics of Web proxy traces suggested, however, the correlation, if any, is so weak that it can be ignored. Hence, the following two questions arise naturally. First, can existing algorithms still perform well when the workload assumption does not hold&quest; Second, if not, can one develop a new file assignment strategy that is immune to the workload assumption&quest; To answer these questions, we first evaluate the performance of three well-known file assignment algorithms with and without the workload assumption, respectively. Next, we develop a novel static nonpartitioned file assignment strategy for parallel I/O systems, called static round-robin (SOR), which is immune to the workload assumption. Comprehensive experimental results show that SOR consistently improves the performance in terms of mean response time over the existing schemes.
