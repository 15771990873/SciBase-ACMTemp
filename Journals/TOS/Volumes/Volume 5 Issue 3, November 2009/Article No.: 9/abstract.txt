Load balancing for clusters has been investigated extensively, mainly focusing on the effective usage of global CPU and memory resources. However, previous CPU- or memory-centric load balancing schemes suffer significant performance drop under I/O-intensive workloads due to the imbalance of I/O load. To solve this problem, we propose two simple yet effective I/O-aware load-balancing schemes for two types of clusters: (1) homogeneous clusters where nodes are identical and (2) heterogeneous clusters, which are comprised of a variety of nodes with different performance characteristics in computing power, memory capacity, and disk speed. In addition to assigning I/O-intensive sequential and parallel jobs to nodes with light I/O loads, the proposed schemes judiciously take into account both CPU and memory load sharing in the system. Therefore, our schemes are able to maintain high performance for a wide spectrum of workloads. We develop analytic models to study mean slowdowns, task arrival, and transfer processes in system levels. Using a set of real I/O-intensive parallel applications and synthetic parallel jobs with various I/O characteristics, we show that our proposed schemes consistently improve the performance over existing non-I/O-aware load-balancing schemes, including CPU- and Memory-aware schemes and a PBS-like batch scheduler for parallel and sequential jobs, for a diverse set of workload conditions. Importantly, this performance improvement becomes much more pronounced when the applications are I/O-intensive. For example, the proposed approaches deliver 23.6--88.0 &percnt; performance improvements for I/O-intensive applications such as LU decomposition, Sparse Cholesky, Titan, Parallel text searching, and Data Mining. When I/O load is low or well balanced, the proposed schemes are capable of maintaining the same level of performance as the existing non-I/O-aware schemes.
