The performance of streaming media servers has been limited by the dual requirements of high disk throughput (to service more clients simultaneously) and low memory use (to decrease system cost). To achieve high disk throughput, disk drives must be accessed with large IOs to amortize disk access overhead. Large IOs imply an increased requirement of expensive DRAM, and, consequently, greater overall system cost. MEMS-based storage, an emerging storage technology, is predicted to offer a price-performance point between those of DRAM and disk drives. In this study, we propose storage architectures that use the relatively inexpensive MEMS-based storage devices as an intermediate layer (between DRAM and disk drives) for temporarily staging large disk IOs at a significantly lower cost. We present data layout mechanisms and synchronized IO scheduling algorithms for the real-time storage and retrieval of streaming data within such an augmented storage system. Analytical evaluation suggests that MEMS-augmented storage hierarchies can reduce the cost and improve the throughput of streaming servers significantly.
