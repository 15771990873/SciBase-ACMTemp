Storage systems based on Phase Change Memory (PCM) devices are beginning to generate considerable attention in both industry and academic communities. But whether the technology in its current state will be a commercially and technically viable alternative to entrenched technologies such as flash-based SSDs remains undecided. To address this, it is important to consider PCM SSD devices not just from a device standpoint, but also from a holistic perspective.This article presents the results of our performance study of a recent all-PCM SSD prototype. The average latency for a 4KiB random read is 6.7μs, which is about 16× faster than a comparable eMLC flash SSD. The distribution of I/O response times is also much narrower than flash SSD for both reads and writes. Based on the performance measurements and real-world workload traces, we explore two typical storage use cases: tiering and caching. We report that the IOPS/$ of a tiered storage system can be improved by 12--66&percnt; and the aggregate elapsed time of a server-side caching solution can be improved by up to 35&percnt; by adding PCM.Our results show that (even at current price points) PCM storage devices show promising performance as a new component in enterprise storage systems.
