Existing space management and address mapping schemes for flash-based Solid-State-Drive (SSD) operate either at page or block granularity, with inevitable limitations in terms of memory requirement, performance, garbage collection, and scalability. To overcome these limitations, we proposed a novel space management and address mapping scheme for flash referred to as Z-MAP, which manages flash space at granularity of Zone. Each Zone consists of multiple numbers of flash blocks. Leveraging workload classification, Z-MAP explores Page-mapping Zone (Page Zone) to store random data and handle a large number of partial updates, and Block-mapping Zone (Block Zone) to store sequential data and lower the overall mapping table. Zones are dynamically allocated and a mapping scheme for a Zone is determined only when it is allocated. Z-MAP uses a small part of Flash memory or phase change memory as a streaming Buffer Zone to log data sequentially and migrate data into Page Zone or Block Zone based on workload classification. A two-level address mapping is designed to reduce the overall mapping table and address translation latency. Z-MAP classifies data before it is permanently stored into Flash memory so that different workloads can be isolated and garbage collection overhead can be minimized.Z-MAP has been extensively evaluated by trace-driven simulation and a prototype implementation on OpenSSD. Our benchmark results conclusively demonstrate that Z-MAP can achieve up to 76&percnt; performance improvement, 81&percnt; mapping table reduction, and 88&percnt; garbage collection overhead reduction compared to existing Flash Translation Layer (FTL) schemes.
