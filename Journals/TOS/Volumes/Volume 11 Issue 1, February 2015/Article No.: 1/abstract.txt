Fast algorithms are proposed for encoding and reconstructing data in RAID based on Reed-Solomon codes. The proposed approach is based on the cyclotomic fast Fourier transform algorithm and enables one to significantly reduce the number of expensive Galois field multiplications required. The complexity of the obtained algorithms is much lower than those for existing MDS array codes. Software implementation of the proposed algorithms is discussed. The performance results show that the new algorithms provide substantially better performance compared with the standard algorithm.
