Modern computer systems have been built around the assumption that persistent storage is accessed via a slow, block-based interface. However, emerging nonvolatile memory technologies (sometimes referred to as storage class memory (SCM)), are poised to revolutionize storage systems. The SCM devices can be attached directly to the memory bus and offer fast, fine-grained access to persistent storage.In this article, we propose a new file system---SCMFS, which is specially designed for Storage Class Memory. SCMFS is implemented on the virtual address space and utilizes the existing memory management module of the operating system to help mange the file system space. As a result, we largely simplified the file system operations of SCMFS, which allowed us a better exploration of performance gain from SCM. We have implemented a prototype in Linux and evaluated its performance through multiple benchmarks. The experimental results show that SCMFS outperforms other memory resident file systems, tmpfs, ramfs and ext2 on ramdisk, and achieves about 70&percnt; of memory bandwidth for file read/write operations.
