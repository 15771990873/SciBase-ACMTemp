While solid-state drives are excellent alternatives to hard disks in mobile devices, a number of performance and reliability issues need to be addressed. In this work, we design an efficient flash management scheme for the performance improvement of low-cost MLC flash memory devices. Specifically, we design an efficient flash management scheme for multi-chipped flash memory devices with cache support, and develop a two-level address translation mechanism with an adaptive caching policy. We evaluated the approach on real workloads. The results demonstrate that it can improve the performance of multi-chipped solid-state drives through logical-to-physical mappings and concurrent accesses to flash chips.
