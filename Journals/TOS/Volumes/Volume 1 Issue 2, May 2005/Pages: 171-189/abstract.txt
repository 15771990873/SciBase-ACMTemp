A file storage scheme is proposed for networks containing heterogeneous clients. In the scheme, the performance measured by file-retrieval delays degrades gracefully under increasingly serious faulty circumstances. The scheme combines coding with storage for better performance. The problem is NP-hard for general networks; and this article focuses on tree networks with asymmetric edges between adjacent nodes. A polynomial-time memory-allocation algorithm is presented, which determines how much data to store on each node, with the objective of minimizing the total amount of data stored in the network. Then a polynomial-time data-interleaving algorithm is used to determine which data to store on each node for satisfying the quality-of-service requirements in the scheme. By combining the memory-allocation algorithm with the data-interleaving algorithm, an optimal solution to realize the file storage scheme in tree networks is established.
