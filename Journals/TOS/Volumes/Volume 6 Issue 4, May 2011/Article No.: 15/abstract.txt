The Flash Translation Layer (FTL) in Solid-State Disks (SSDs) maps logical addresses to physical addresses for disk drive virtualization. In order to reduce garbage collection overhead, we propose full associative striped block-level mapping. In addition, an adaptive merge is proposed to avoid excessive data block reconstructions during garbage collection. With these mechanisms, the write latency is improved up to 78&percnt; in comparison with the previous multichannel hybrid FTLs in a sample PC trace. The performance improvements stem from 52&percnt; reduced garbage collection.
