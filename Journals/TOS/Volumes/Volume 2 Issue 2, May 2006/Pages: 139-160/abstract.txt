MEMS-based storage is an emerging nonvolatile secondary storage technology. It promises high performance, high storage density, and low power consumption. With fundamentally different architectural designs from magnetic disk, MEMS-based storage exhibits unique two-dimensional positioning behaviors and efficient power state transitions. We model these low-level, device-specific properties of MEMS-based storage and present request scheduling algorithms and power management strategies that exploit the full potential of these devices. Our simulations show that MEMS-specific device management policies can significantly improve system performance and reduce power consumption.
