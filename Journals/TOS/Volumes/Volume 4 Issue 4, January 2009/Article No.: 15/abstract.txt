As storage systems grow in size and complexity, they are increasingly confronted with concurrent disk failures together with multiple unrecoverable sector errors. To ensure high data reliability and availability, erasure codes with high fault tolerance are required. In this article, we present a new family of erasure codes with high fault tolerance, named GRID codes. They are called such because they are a family ofstrip-based codeswhose strips are arranged into multi-dimensional grids. In the construction of GRID codes, we first introduce a concept ofmatched codesand then discuss how to use matched codes to construct GRID codes. In addition, we propose an iterative reconstruction algorithm for GRID codes. We also discuss some important features of GRID codes. Finally, we compare GRID codes with several categories of existing codes. Our comparisons show that for large-scale storage systems, our GRID codes have attractive advantages over many existing erasure codes: (a) They are completely XOR-based and have very regular structures, ensuring easy implementation; (b) they can provide up to 15 and even higher fault tolerance; and (c) their storage efficiency can reach up to 80&percnt; and even higher. All the advantages make GRID codes more suitable for large-scale storage systems.
