IEEE-1394 is widely adopted in various commercial products for computing, communication, and entertainment. Although many services with Quality-of-Service (QoS) supports are now available in systems over IEEE-1394, little work is done for QoS-based resource allocation. In this article, we aim at the design of a bandwidth reservation mechanism and its policy for isochronous requests, such as those from cameras. We then address the QoS support issue for asynchronous requests, such as those from disks, and an analytic framework for probability-based QoS guarantees. This work is concluded by the proposing of a topology configuration algorithm for IEEE-1394 devices. The capability of the proposed methodology and the analytic framework are evaluated by a series of experiments over a Linux-based system prototype.
