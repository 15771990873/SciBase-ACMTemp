Healthcare informatics has drawn substantial attention in recent years. Current work on healthcare informatics is highly interdisciplinary involving methodologies from computing, engineering, information science, behavior science, management science, social science, as well as many different areas in medicine and public health. Three major tracks, (i) systems, (ii) analytics, and (iii) human factors, can be identified. Thesystemstrack focuses on healthcare system architecture, framework, design, engineering, and application; theanalyticstrack emphasizes data/information processing, retrieval, mining, analytics, as well as knowledge discovery; thehuman factorstrack targets the understanding of users or context, interface design, and user studies of healthcare applications. In this article, we discuss some of the latest development and introduce several articles selected for this special issue. We envision that the development of computing-oriented healthcare informatics research will continue to grow rapidly. The integration of different disciplines to advance the healthcare and wellbeing of our society will also be accelerated.
