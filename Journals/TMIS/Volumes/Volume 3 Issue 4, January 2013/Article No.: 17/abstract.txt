Business intelligence and analytics (BIA) is about the development of technologies, systems, practices, and applications to analyze critical business data so as to gain new insights about business and markets. The new insights can be used for improving products and services, achieving better operational efficiency, and fostering customer relationships. In this article, we will categorize BIA research activities into three broad research directions: (a) big data analytics, (b) text analytics, and (c) network analytics. The article aims to review the state-of-the-art techniques and models and to summarize their use in BIA applications. For each research direction, we will also determine a few important questions to be addressed in future research.
