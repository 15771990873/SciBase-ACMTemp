Large systems are complex and typically need automatic configuration to be managed effectively. In any organization, numerous tasks have to be carried out by employees. However, due to security needs, it is not feasible to directly assign any existing task to the first available employee. In order to meet many additional security requirements, constraints such as separation of duty, cardinality and binding have to be taken into consideration. Meeting these requirements imposes extra burden on organizations, which, however, is unavoidable in order to ensure security. While a trivial way of ensuring security is to assign each user to a single task, business organizations would typically like to minimize their costs and keep staffing requirements to a minimum. To meet these contradictory goals, we define the problem of Cardinality Constrained-Mutually Exclusive Task Minimum User Problem (CMUP), which aims to find the minimum users that can carry out a set of tasks while satisfying the given security constraints. We show that the CMUP problem is equivalent to a constrained version of the weak chromatic number problem in hypergraphs, which is NP-hard. We, therefore, propose a greedy solution. Our experimental evaluation shows that the proposed algorithm is both efficient and effective.
