“Big Data,” huge volumes of data in both structured and unstructured forms generated by the Internet, social media, and computerized transactions, is straining our technical capacity to manage it. More importantly, the new challenge is to develop the capability to understand and interpret the burgeoning volume of data to take advantage of the opportunities it provides in many human endeavors, ranging from science to business. Data Science, and in business schools, Business Intelligence and Analytics (BI&A;) are emerging disciplines that seek to address the demands of this new era. Big Data and BI&A; present unique challenges and opportunities not only for the research community, but also for Information Systems (IS) programs at business schools. In this essay, we provide a brief overview of BI&A;, speculate on the role of BI&A; education in business schools, present the challenges facing IS departments, and discuss the role of IS curricula and program development, in delivering BI&A; education. We contend that a new vision for the IS discipline should address these challenges.
