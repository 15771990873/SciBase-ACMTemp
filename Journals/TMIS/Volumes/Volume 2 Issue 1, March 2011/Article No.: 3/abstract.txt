Talks are actions, and language represents the medium through which we encounter reality, carry out practical reasoning, and construct social actions. This study applies the speech act theory to analyze the data collected in a study by Trauth and Jessup [2000] and confirms previous research findings that both the topic and the group size influence the pattern of discussion, especially when issues are threatening. It also shows that the abundance of speech acts like assertives, directives, and expressives can be accounted for by a few simple recurring patterns, indicating participants are rather close-minded. More important, linguistic analysis helps uncovering defensive speech routines that inhibit the generation of valid information and create self-sealing patterns of escalating error. Linguistic analysis may therefore complement positivist and interpretive analysis by examining if participants' engagement is superficial or profound, if consensus is reached or blocked, and if certain speech acts lead to dysfunctional organizational learning. Hence, in the era of participatory Web in which language is the primary medium for interactive sharing and dynamic collaboration, linguistic analysis can be applied to study the promises and declarations that people rely on to initiate, coordinate, and complete social actions.
