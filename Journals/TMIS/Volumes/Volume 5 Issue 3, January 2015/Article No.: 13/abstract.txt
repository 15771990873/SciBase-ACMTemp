Requirements engineering must recognize the difference between complicated and complex problems. The former can lead to successful solutions. The latter should be avoided because they often lead to failure. As a starting point for distinguishing between complicated and complex, this article offers six characteristics of complex problems, with examples from economics, logistics, forecasting, among others. These characteristics make it easier and more systematic to recognize complexity during requirements elicitation and formulation.
