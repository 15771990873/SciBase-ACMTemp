In Ambient Intelligence (AmI) vision, people should be able to seamlessly and unobtrusively use and configure the intelligent devices and systems in their ubiquitous computing environments without being cognitively and physically overloaded. In other words, the user should not have to program each device or connect them together to achieve the required functionality. However, although it is possible for a human operator to specify an active space configuration explicitly, the size, sophistication, and dynamic requirements of modern living environment demand that they have autonomous intelligence satisfying the needs of inhabitants without human intervention. This work presents a proposal for AmI fuzzy computing that exploits multiagent systems and fuzzy theory to realize a long-life learning strategy able to generate context-aware-based fuzzy services and actualize them through abstraction techniques in order to maximize the users' comfort and hardware interoperability level. Experimental results show that proposed approach is capable of anticipating user's requirements by automatically generating the most suitable collection of interoperable fuzzy services.
