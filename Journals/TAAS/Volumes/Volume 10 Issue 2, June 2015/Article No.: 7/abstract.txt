IEEE SASO (Self-Adapting and Self-Organizing Systems) is the premier international conference for computer systems and networks that autonomously change some aspect of themselves: code, form, function, shape, structure, components, and so on. Over the past 10 years, it has emerged as a key multidisciplinary event for sharing theoretical insights and technical innovations across the numerous scientific fields and application domains impacted by this research. In 2013, the conference was hosted by Drexel University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and offered an extensive program of high-quality papers. This special issue of ACM TAAS presents selected, revised, and extended best articles, which showcase the rich variety and depth of the SASO scientific community.
