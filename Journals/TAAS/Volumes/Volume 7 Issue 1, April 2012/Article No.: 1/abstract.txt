Self-organizing multi-agent systems provide a suitable paradigm for developing autonomic computing systems that manage themselves. Towards this goal, we demonstrate a robust, decentralized approach for structural adaptation in explicitly modeled problem solving agent organizations. Based on self-organization principles, our method enables the autonomous agents to modify their structural relations to achieve a better allocation of tasks in a simulated task-solving environment. Specifically, the agents reason about when and how to adapt using only their history of interactions as guidance. We empirically show that, in a wide range of closed, open, static, and dynamic scenarios, the performance of organizations using our method is close (70–90&percnt;) to that of an idealized centralized allocation method and is considerably better (10–60&percnt;) than the current state-of-the-art decentralized approaches.
