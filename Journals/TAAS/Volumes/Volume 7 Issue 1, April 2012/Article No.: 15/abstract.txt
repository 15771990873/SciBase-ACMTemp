Embryonic development of multicellular organisms, also known as morphogenesis, is regarded as a robust self-organization process for pattern generation. Inspired by the recent findings in biology indicating that morphogen gradients, together with a Gene Regulatory Network (GRN), play a key role in biological patterning, we propose a framework for self-organized multirobot pattern formation and boundary coverage based on an artificial GRN model. The proposed framework does not need a global coordinate system, which makes it more practical to be implemented in a physical robotic system. Moreover, an adaptation mechanism is included in the framework so that the self-organization algorithm is robust to changes in the number of robots. Various case studies of multirobot pattern formation and boundary coverage show the effectiveness of the framework.
