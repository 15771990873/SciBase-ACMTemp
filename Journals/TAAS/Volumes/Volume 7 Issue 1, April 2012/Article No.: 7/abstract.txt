Advances in pervasive technology have made it possible to consider large-scale application types that potentially span heterogeneous organizations, technologies, and device types. This class of application will have a multilayer architecture, where each layer is likely to use languages and technologies appropriate to its own concerns. An example application is a geographically large-scale crisis management system. Typically, such applications are required to dynamically adapt their behavior based on current circumstances, with adaptations potentially affecting all layers of the application. The complexities involved in dynamically adapting multilayer applications will significantly benefit from formal approaches to its specification.This article presents a new methodology for flexible, multilayer application adaptation, with layer-specific adaptation solution templates bound to application mismatches that are organized into hierarchical taxonomies. Templates can be linked either through direct invocations or through adaptation events, supporting flexible cross-layer adaptation. The methodology illustrates the use of different formalisms for different elements of its specification. In particular, we combine semiformal metamodeling techniques for the system model specification with formal Petri nets, which are used to capture template matchmaking using reachability analysis. This work demonstrates how existing formalisms can be used for the specification of a generic adaptation model for pervasive applications.
