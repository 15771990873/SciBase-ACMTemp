In multiplex networks, agents are connected by multiple types of links; a multiplex network can be split into more than one network layer that is composed of the same type of links and involved agents. Each network link type has a bias for communicating different types of resources; thus, the taskâ€™s access to the required resources in multiplex networks is strongly related to the network link types. However, traditional task allocation and load balancing methods only considered the situations of agents themselves and did not address the effects of network link types in multiplex networks. To solve this problem, this article considers both link types and agents, and substantially extends the existing work by highlighting the effect of network layers on task allocation and load balancing. Two multiplex network-adapted models of task allocation with load balancing are presented: network layer-oriented allocation and agent-oriented allocation. This article also addresses the unreliability in multiplex networks, which includes the unreliable links and agents, and implements a reliable task allocation based on a negotiation reputation and reward mechanism. Our findings show that both of our presented models can effectively and robustly satisfy the task allocation objectives in unreliable multiplex networks; the experiments prove that they can significantly reduce the time costs and improve the success rate of tasks for multiplex networks over the traditional simplex network-adapted task allocation model. Lastly, we find that our presented network layer-oriented allocation performs much better in terms of reliability and allocation time compared to our presented agent-oriented allocation, which further explains the importance of network layers in multiplex networks.
