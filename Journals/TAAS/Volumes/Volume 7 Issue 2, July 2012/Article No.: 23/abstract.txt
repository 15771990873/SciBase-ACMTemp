This article develops a shared-secret free wireless security infrastructure that provides confidentiality, identity authentication, message authentication, integrity, sender nonrepudiation, receiver nonrepudiation, and anonymity. Our infrastructure is based on two physical primitives, namely collaborative jamming and spatial signature enforcement, and a zero knowledge alternative for bootstrapping trust. Notably, it eschews the use of shared secrets, while providing a cryptosystem that is no less secure than conventional cryptosystems.
