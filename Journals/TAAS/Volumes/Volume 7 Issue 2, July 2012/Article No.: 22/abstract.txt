We introduce the Read-Write-Coding-System (RWC), a very flexible class of linear block codes that generate efficient and flexible erasure codes for storage networks. In particular, given a messagexofksymbols and a codewordyofnsymbols, an RW code defines additional parametersk≤ r,w≤ nthat offer enhanced possibilities to adjust the fault-tolerance capability of the code. More precisely, an RWC provides linear(n,r,d)-codes that have: (a) minimum (Hamming) distanced = n-r&plus;1for any two codewords, and (b) for any codewordy1there exists a codewordy2with distance of at mostw. Furthermore, depending on the valuesr,wand the code alphabet, different block codes such as parity codes (e.g., RAID 4/5) or Reed-Solomon (RS) codes (ifr = kand thus,w = n) can be generated. In storage networks in which I/O accesses are very costly and redundancy is crucial, this flexibility has considerable advantages asrandwcan optimally be adapted to read or write intensive applications; onlywsymbols must be updated if the messagexchanges completely, which is different from other codes that always need to rewriteycompletely asxchanges. In this article, we first state a tight lower bound and basic conditions for all RW codes. Furthermore, we introduce special RW codes in which all mentioned parameters are adjustable even online, that is, RW codes which are adaptive to changing demands. At last, we investigate the question for which choices of(k,r,w,n)a coding system exists over the binary alphabet F2= {0,1} and discuss how RW codes can be combined.
