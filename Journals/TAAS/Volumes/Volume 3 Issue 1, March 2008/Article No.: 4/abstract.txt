Smart networks have grown out of the need for stable, reliable, and predictable networks that will guarantee packet delivery under Quality of Service (QoS) constraints. In this article we present a measurement-based admission control algorithm that helps control traffic congestion and guarantee QoS throughout the lifetime of a connection. When a new user requests to enter the network, probe packets are sent from the source to the destination to estimate the impact that the new connection will have on the QoS of both the new and the existing users. The algorithm uses a novel algebra of QoS metrics, inspired by Warshall's algorithm, to look for a path with acceptable QoS values to accommodate the new flow. We describe the underlying mathematical principles and present experimental results obtained by evaluating the method in a large laboratory test-bed operating the Cognitive Packet Network (CPN) protocol.
