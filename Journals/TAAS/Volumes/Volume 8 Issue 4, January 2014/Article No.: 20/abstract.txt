The article presents an access control model calledCriticality Aware Access Control(CAAC) for criticality (emergency) management in smart infrastructures. Criticalities are consequences of events which take a system (in our case, a smart infrastructure) into an unstable state. They require the execution of specificresponse actionsin order to bring them under control. The principal aim of CAAC is to grant the right set of access privileges (to facilitate response action execution), at the right time, to the right set of subjects, for the right duration, in order to control the criticalities within the system. In this regard, the CAAC model uses a stochastic model called theAction Generation Modelto determine the required response actions for the combination of criticalities present within the system. It then facilitates response actions byadaptivelyaltering the privileges to specific subjects, in aproactivemanner, without the need for any explicit access requests. In this article, we formalize the CAAC model and validate it based on twodesign goals- proactivity and adaptiveness. Finally, we present a case study demonstrating CAACâ€™s operation on an oil-rig platform in order to aid in the response to health- and fire-related criticalities.
