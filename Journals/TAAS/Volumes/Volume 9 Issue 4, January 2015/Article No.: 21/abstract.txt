A data-centric joint adaptive sampling and sleep scheduling solution, SILENCE, for autonomic sensor-based systems that monitor and reconstruct physical or environmental phenomena is proposed. Adaptive sampling and sleep scheduling can help realize the much needed resource efficiency by minimizing the communication and processing overhead in densely deployed autonomic sensor-based systems. The proposed solution exploits the spatiotemporal correlation in sensed data and eliminates redundancy in transmitted data through selective representation without compromising on accuracy of reconstruction of the monitored phenomenon at a remote monitor node. Differently from existing adaptive sampling solutions, SILENCE employs temporal causality analysis to not only track the variation in the underlying phenomenon but also its cause and direction of propagation in the field. The causality analysis and the same correlations are then leveraged for adaptive sleep scheduling aimed at saving energy in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). SILENCE outperforms traditional adaptive sampling solutions as well as the recently proposed compressive sampling techniques. Real experiments were performed on a WSN testbed monitoring temperature and humidity distribution in a rack of servers, and the simulations were performed on TOSSIM, the TinyOS simulator.
