A mathematical formalism is sketched for representing relational structure between agents.n-ary relations,n> 2, require hypernetworks, which generalize binary relation networks.n-ary relations on sets create structure at higher levels of representation to the elements in multilevel systems. Thestateof a system is represented by its multilevel relational structure. Thedynamicsof a system are represented by state changes through time. These can be continuous with no change in the hypernetwork topology, but often they are not. Controlling such systems involves taking actions intended to result in desirable state changes. The concept of multilevel hypernetwork can be applied to multiagent systems in general.
