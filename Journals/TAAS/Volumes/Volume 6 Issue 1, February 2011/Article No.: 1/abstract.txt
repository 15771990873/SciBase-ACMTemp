Ubiquitous and Pervasive Computing (UPC) are recent paradigms with a goal of providing computing and communication services anytime and everywhere. In UPC, automatic service composition requires dealing with four major research issues: service matching and selection, coordination and management, scalability and fault tolerance, and adaptiveness to usersâ€™ contexts and network conditions. The articles in this special issue cover some of these topics and constitute a representative sample of the latest developments in adaptive service discovery and composition in UPC.
