Aself-stabilizingsystem is one that guarantees reaching a set oflegitimate statesfrom any arbitrary initial state. Designing distributed self-stabilizing protocols is often a complex task and developing their proof of correctness is known to be significantly more tedious. In this article, we propose an SMT-based method that automatically synthesizes a self-stabilizing protocol, given the network topology of distributed processes and description of the set of legitimate states. Our method can synthesize synchronous, asynchronous, symmetric, and asymmetric protocols for two types of stabilization, namelyweakandstrong. We also report on successful automated synthesis of a set of well-known distributed stabilizing protocols such as Dijkstraâ€™s token ring, distributed maximal matching, graph coloring, and mutual exclusion in anonymous networks.
