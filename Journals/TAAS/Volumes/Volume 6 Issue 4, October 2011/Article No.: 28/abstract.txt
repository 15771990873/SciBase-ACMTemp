Autonomic computing enables computing infrastructures to perform administration tasks with minimal human intervention. This wrap-up paper describes the experience we gained with the design and use ofJade---an architecture-based autonomic system. The contributions of this article are, (1) to explain howJadeprovides autonomic management of a distributed system through an architecture-based approach, (2) to explain how we extended autonomic management from traditional self behaviors such as repairing or protecting a managed system to self-self behaviors whereJadealso fully manages itself as it manages any other distributed system, (3) to report on our experience reaching self-self behaviors for two crucial autonomic properties, repair and protection.
