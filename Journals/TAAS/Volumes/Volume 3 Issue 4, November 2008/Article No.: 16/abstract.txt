We consider distributed systems made ofweak mobilerobots, that is, mobile devices, equipped with sensors, that areanonymous,autonomous,disoriented, andoblivious. TheCircle Formation Problem(CFP) consists of the design of a protocol insuring that, starting from an initial arbitrary configuration where no two robots are at the same position, all the robots eventually form aregular n-gon—the robots take place on the circumference of a circleCwith equal spacing between any two adjacent robots onC.CFP is known to be unsolvable by arranging the robots evenly along the circumference of a circleCwithout leavingC—that is, starting from a configuration where the robots are on the boundary ofC. We circumvent this impossibility result by designing a scheme based onconcentric circles. This is the first scheme that deterministically solves CFP. We present our method with two different implementations working in the semi-synchronous system (SSM) for any numbern≥ 5 of robots.
