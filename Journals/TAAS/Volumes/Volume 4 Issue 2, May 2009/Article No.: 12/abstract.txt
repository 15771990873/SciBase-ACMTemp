This article presents a semantics-based context-aware dynamic service composition framework that composes an application through combining distributed components based on the semantics of components and contexts of users. The proposed framework consists of Component Service Model with Semantics (CoSMoS), Component Runtime Environment (CoRE), and Semantic Graph based Service Composition (SeGSeC). CoSMoS models the semantics of components and contexts of users. CoRE is a middleware to support CoSMoS on various distributed computing technologies. SeGSeC is a mechanism to compose an application by synthesizing its workflow based on the semantics of components and contexts of users. The proposed framework is capable of composing applications requested in a natural language by leveraging the semantic information of components. The proposed framework composes applications differently to individual users based on their contexts and preferences. The proposed framework acquires user preferences from user-specified rules and also via learning. The proposed framework also adapts to dynamic environments by autonomously composing a new application upon detecting context change. This article describes the design and mechanism of the proposed framework, and also presents simulation experiments to evaluate the proposed framework.
