A “Smart Spaces System”, called MITOS, for improved user connectivity in large wireless LAN installations is proposed. MITOS extends the scope of resource management to the dynamic relocation of nomadic users: the system suggests to a user the best location to move to for obtaining a satisfactory quality of service level, when the controlling access point of its current location becomes congested. The system monitors the traffic and user location across the network, and formulates the appropriate relocation proposal urging specific users to move to better locations at reasonable distances. Two enhancements to the basic MITOS system are introduced for maintaining an almost uniform load level across the considered infrastructure: the first uses microeconomic concepts, while the second borrows game theoretic mechanisms from the Santa Fe Bar problem. Simulation results on the efficiency of the proposed schemes are provided.
