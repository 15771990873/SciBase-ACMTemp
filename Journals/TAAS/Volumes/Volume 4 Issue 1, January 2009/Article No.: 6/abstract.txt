In this article, we show that some fundamental self- and snap-stabilizing wave protocols (e.g., token circulation,PIF, etc.) implicitly assume a very light property that we callBreakingIn. We prove thatBreakingInis strictly induced by self- and snap-stabilization. Combined with a transformer,BreakingInallows to easily turn the non-fault-tolerant versions of those protocols into snap-stabilizing versions. Unlike the previous solutions, the transformed protocols are very efficient and work at least with the same daemon as the initial versions extended to satisfyBreakingIn. Finally, we show how to use an additional property of the transformer to design snap-stabilizing extensions of those fundamental protocols like Mutual Exclusion.
