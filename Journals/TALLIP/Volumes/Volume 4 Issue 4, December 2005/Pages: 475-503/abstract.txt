A great deal of technology has been developed to help people access the information they require. With advances in the availability of information, information-seeking activities are becoming more sophisticated. This means that information technology must move to the next stage, i.e., enable users to acquire information from multiple perspectives to satisfy diverse needs. For instance, with the spread of digital broadcasting and broadband Internet connection services, infrastructure for the integration of TV programs and the Internet has been developed that enables users to acquire information from different media at the same time to improve information quality and the level of detail. In this paper, we propose a novel content-based join model for data streams (closed captions of videos or TV programs) and Web pages based on the concept of topic structures. We then propose a mechanism based on this model for retrieving complementary Web pages to augment the content of video or television programs. One of the most notable features of this complementary retrieval mechanism is that the retrieved information is not just similar to the video or TV program, but also provides additional information. In addition, we introduce an application system called WebTelop, which augments the content of TV programs in real time by using complementary Web pages. We also describe some experimental results.
