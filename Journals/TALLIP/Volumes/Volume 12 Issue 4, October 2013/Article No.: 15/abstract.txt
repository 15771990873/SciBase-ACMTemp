We introduce a method for learning to predict text and grammatical construction in a computer-assisted translation and writing framework. In our approach, predictions are offered on the fly to help the user make appropriate lexical and grammar choices during the translation of a source text, thus improving translation quality and productivity. The method involves automatically generating general-to-specific word usage summaries (i.e., writing suggestion module), and automatically learning high-confidence word- or phrase-level translation equivalents (i.e., translation suggestion module). At runtime, the source text and its translation prefix entered by the user are broken down into n-grams to generate grammar and translation predictions, which are further combined and ranked via translation and language models. These ranked prediction candidates are iteratively and interactively displayed to the user in a pop-up menu as translation or writing hints. We present a prototype writing assistant,TransAhead, that applies the method to a human-computer collaborative environment. Automatic and human evaluations show that novice translators or language learners substantially benefit from our system in terms of translation performance (i.e., translation accuracy and productivity) and language learning (i.e., collocation usage and grammar). In general, our methodology of inline grammar and text predictions or suggestions has great potential in the field of computer-assisted translation, writing, or even language learning.
