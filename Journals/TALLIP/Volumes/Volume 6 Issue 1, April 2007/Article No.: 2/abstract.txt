In this article, we propose a new postprocessing strategy, word suggestion, based on a multiple word trigger-pair language model for Chinese character recognizers. With the word suggestion strategy, Chinese character recognizers may even achieve a recognition rate greater than the top-n candidate recognition rate. To construct the multiple word trigger-pair model, data mining techniques are used to alleviate the intensive computation problem. Furthermore, rough set theory is first used in the study to discover negatively correlated relationships between words in order to prevent introducing wrong words in the process of word suggestion.
