This paper compares some existing evaluation metrics for factoid question answering (QA) from the viewpoint of stability and sensitivity, using the NTCIR-4 QAC2 Japanese factoid QA tasks and the Buckley/Voorhees stability method and Voorhees/Buckley swap method. Our main findings are: (1) For QA evaluation with ranked lists containing up to five answers, the fraction of questions with a correct answer within top 5 (NQcorrect5) and that with a correct answer at rank 1 (NQcorrect1) are not as stable and sensitive as reciprocal rank. (2) Q-measure, which can handle multiple correct answers and answer correctness levels, is at least as stable and sensitive as reciprocal rank, provided that amildgain value assignment is used. Emphasizing answer correctness levels tends to hurt stability and sensitivity, while handling multiple correct answers improves them. As our experimental methods are language-independent, we believe that these findings apply to QA in languages other than Japanese as well.
