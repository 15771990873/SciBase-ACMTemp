Identifying semantic relations is a crucial step in discourse analysis and is useful for many applications in both language and speech technology. Automatic detection ofCausalrelations therefore has gained popularity in the literature within different frameworks. The aim of this article is the automatic detection and extraction ofCausalrelations that are explicitly expressed in Arabic texts. To fulfill this goal, aPattern Recognizermodel was developed to signal the presence of cause--effect information within sentences from nonspecific domain texts. This model incorporates approximately 700 linguistic patterns so that parts of the sentence representing thecauseand those representing theeffectcan be distinguished. The patterns were constructed based on different sets of syntactic features by analyzing a large untagged Arabic corpus. In addition, the model was boosted with three independent algorithms to deal with certain types of grammatical particles that indicate causation. With this approach, the proposed model achieved an overallrecallof 81&percnt; and aprecisionof 78&percnt;. Evaluation results revealed that the justification particles play a key role in detectingCausalrelations. To the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have been dedicated to dealing with this type of relation in the Arabic language.
