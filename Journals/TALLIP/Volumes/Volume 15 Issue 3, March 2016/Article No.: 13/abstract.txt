Current shift-reduce parsers “understand” the context by embodying a large number of binary indicator features with a discriminative model. In this article, we propose the action n-gram model, which utilizes the action sequence to help parsing disambiguation. The action n-gram model is trained on action sequences produced by parsers with the n-gram estimation method, which gives a smoothed maximum likelihood estimation of the action probability given a specific action history. We show that incorporating action n-gram models into a state-of-the-art parsing framework could achieve parsing accuracy improvements on three datasets across two languages.
