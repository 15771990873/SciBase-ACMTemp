There has been recent interest in statistical approaches to Korean morphological analysis. However, previous studies have been based mostly on generative models, including a hidden Markov model (HMM), without utilizing discriminative models such as a conditional random field (CRF). We present a two-stage discriminative approach based on CRFs for Korean morphological analysis. Similar to methods used for Chinese, we perform two disambiguation procedures based on CRFs: (1) morpheme segmentation and (2) POS tagging. In morpheme segmentation, an input sentence is segmented into sequences of morphemes, where a morpheme unit is either atomic or compound. In the POS tagging procedure, each morpheme (atomic or compound) is assigned a POS tag. Once POS tagging is complete, we carry out a post-processing of the compound morphemes, where each compound morpheme is further decomposed into atomic morphemes, which is based on pre-analyzed patterns and generalized HMMs obtained from the given tagged corpus. Experimental results show the promise of our proposed method.
