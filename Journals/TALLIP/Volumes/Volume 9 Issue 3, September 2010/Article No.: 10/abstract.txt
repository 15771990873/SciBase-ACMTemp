The aim of the Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation (FIRE) is to create an evaluation framework in the spirit of TREC (Text REtrieval Conference), CLEF (Cross-Language Evaluation Forum), and NTCIR (NII Test Collection for IR Systems), for Indian language Information Retrieval. The first evaluation exercise conducted by FIRE was completed in 2008. This article describes the test collections used at FIRE 2008, summarizes the approaches adopted by various participants, discusses the limitations of the datasets, and outlines the tasks planned for the next iteration of FIRE.
