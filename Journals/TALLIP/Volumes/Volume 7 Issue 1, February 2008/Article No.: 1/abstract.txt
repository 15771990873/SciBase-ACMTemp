Named entity (NE) translation is a fundamental task in multilingual natural language processing. The performance of a machine translation system depends heavily on precise translation of the inclusive NEs. Furthermore, organization name (ON) is the most complex NE for translation among all the NEs. In this article, the structure formulation of ONs is investigated and a hierarchical structure-based ON translation model for Chinese-to-English translation system is presented.First, the model performs ON chunking; then both the translation of words within chunks and the process of chunk-reordering are achieved by synchronous context-free grammar (CFG). The CFG rules are extracted from bilingual ON pairs in a training program.The main contributions of this article are: (1) defining appropriate chunk-units for analyzing the internal structure of Chinese ONs; (2) making the chunk-based ON translation feasible and flexible via a hierarchical CFG derivation; and (3) proposing a training architecture to automatically learn the synchronous CFG for constructing ONs with chunk-units from aligned bilingual ON pairs. The experiments show that the proposed approach translates the Chinese ONs into English with an accuracy of 93.75&percnt; and significantly improves the performance of a baseline statistical machine translation (SMT) system.
