The main issues of practical spoken-language applications for
human-computer interface are how to overcome speech recognition
errors and guarantee the reasonable end-performance of
spoken-language applications. Therefore, handling the erroneously
recognized outputs is a key in developing robust spoken-language
systems. To address this problem, we present a method to improve
the accuracy of speech recognition and performance of
spoken-language applications. The proposed error corrective
reranking approach exploits recognition environment characteristics
and domain-specific semantic information to provide robustness and
adaptability for a spoken-language system. We demonstrate some
experiments of spoken dialogue tasks and empirical results that
show an improvement in accuracy for both speech recognition and
spoken-language understanding. In our experiment, we show an error
reduction of up to 9.7% and 16.8%; of word error rate, and 5.5% and
7.9% of understanding error for the air travel and telebanking
service domains.
