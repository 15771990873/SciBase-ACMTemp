The Arabic language has a very rich/complex morphology. Each Arabic word is composed of zero or moreprefixes, onestemand zero or moresuffixes. Consequently, the Arabic data is sparse compared to other languages such as English, and it is necessary to conduct word segmentation before any natural language processing task. Therefore, the word-segmentation step is worth a deeper study since it is a preprocessing step which shall have a significant impact on all the steps coming afterward. In this article, we present an Arabic mention detection system that has very competitive results in the recent Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) evaluation campaign. We investigate the impact of different segmentation schemes on Arabic mention detection systems and we show how these systems may benefit from more than one segmentation scheme. We report the performance of several mention detection models using different kinds of possible and known segmentation schemes for Arabic text: punctuation separation, Arabic Treebank, and morphological and character-level segmentations. We show that the combination of competitive segmentation styles leads to a better performance. Results indicate a statistically significant improvement when Arabic Treebank and morphological segmentations are combined.
