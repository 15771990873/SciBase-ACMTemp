The Kurdish language is an Indo-European language spoken in Kurdistan, a large geographical region in the Middle East. Despite having a large number of speakers, Kurdish is among the less-resourced languages and has not seen much attention from the IR and NLP research communities. This article reports on the outcomes of a project aimed at providing essential resources for processing Kurdish texts.A principal output of this project is Pewan, the first standard Test Collection to evaluate Kurdish Information Retrieval systems. The other language resources that we have built include a lightweight stemmer and a list of stopwords.Our second principal contribution is using these newly-built resources to conduct a thorough experimental study on Kurdish documents. Our experimental results show that normalization, and to a lesser extent, stemming, can greatly improve the performance of Kurdish IR systems.
