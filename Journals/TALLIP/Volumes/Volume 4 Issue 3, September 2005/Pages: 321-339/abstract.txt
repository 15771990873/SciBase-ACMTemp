It is necessary to determine a proper arrangement of extracted sentences to generate a well-organized summary from multiple documents. This paper describes our Multi-Document Summarization (MDS) system for TSC-3. It specifically addresses an approach to coherent sentence ordering for MDS. An impediment to the use of chronological ordering, which is widely used by conventional summarization system, is that it arranges sentences without considering the presupposed information of each sentence. We propose a method to improve chronological ordering by resolving precedent information of arranging sentences. Combining the refinement algorithm with topical segmentation and chronological ordering, we address our experiments and metrics to test the effectiveness of MDS tasks. Results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves chronological sentence ordering. At the end of the paper, we also report an outline/evaluation of important sentence extraction and redundant clause elimination integrated in our MDS system.
