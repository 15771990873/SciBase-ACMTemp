Twenty-five Japanese Question Answering systems participated in NTCIR QAC2 subtask 1. Of these, our system SAIQA-QAC2 performed the best: MRR &equals; 0.607. SAIQA-QAC2 is an improvement on our previous system SAIQA-Ii that achieved MRR &equals; 0.46 for QAC1. We mainly improved the answer-type determination module and the retrieval module. In general, a fine-grained answer taxonomy improves QA performance but it is difficult to build an accurate answer extraction module for the fine-grained taxonomy because Machine Learning methods require a huge training corpus and hand-crafted rules are hard to maintain. Therefore, we built a fine-grained system by using a coarse-grained named entity recognizer and a Japanese lexicon “Nihongo Goi-taikei.” Our experiments show that named entity/numerical expression recognition and word sense-based answer extraction mainly contributed to the performance. In addition, we developed a new proximity-based document retrieval module that performs better than BM25. We also compared its performance with MultiText, a conventional proximity-based retrieval method developed for QA.
