In recent years, answer-focused summarization has gained attention as a technology complementary to information retrieval and question answering. In order to realize multi-document summarization focused by multiple questions, we propose a method to calculate sentence importance using scores, for responses to multiple questions, generated by a Question-Answering engine. Further, we describe the integration of this method with a generic multi-document summarization system. The evaluation results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed method is better than not only several baselines but also other participants' systems at the evaluation workshop NTCIR4 TSC3 Formal Run. However, it should be noted that some of the other systems do not use the information of questions.
