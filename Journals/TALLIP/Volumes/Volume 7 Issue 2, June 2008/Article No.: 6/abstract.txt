This article describes our approach for answering why-questions that we initially introduced at NTCIR-6 QAC-4. The approach automatically acquires causal expression patterns from relation-annotated corpora by abstracting text spans annotated with a causal relation and by mining syntactic patterns that are useful for distinguishing sentences annotated with a causal relation from those annotated with other relations. We use these automatically acquired causal expression patterns to create features to represent answer candidates, and use these features together with other possible features related to causality to train an answer candidate ranker that maximizes the QA performance with regards to the corpus of why-questions and answers. NAZEQA, a Japanese why-QA system based on our approach, clearly outperforms baselines with a Mean Reciprocal Rank (top-5) of 0.223 when sentences are used as answers and with a MRR (top-5) of 0.326 when paragraphs are used as answers, making it presumably the best-performing fully implemented why-QA system. Experimental results also verified the usefulness of the automatically acquired causal expression patterns.
