In this article we describe a hybrid technique for dictionary-based query translation suitable for English-Chinese cross language information retrieval. This technique marries a graph-based model for the resolution of candidate term ambiguity with a pattern-based method for the translation of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) terms. We evaluate the performance of this hybrid technique in an experiment using several NTCIR test collections. Experimental results indicate a substantial increase in retrieval effectiveness over various baseline systems incorporating machine- and dictionary-based translation.
