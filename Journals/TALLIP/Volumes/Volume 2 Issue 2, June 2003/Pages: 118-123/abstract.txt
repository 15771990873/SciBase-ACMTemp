The frequent occurrence ofdivergencesâ€”structural differences between languages---presents a great challenge for statistical word-level alignment and machine translation. This paper describes the adaptation of DUSTer, a divergence unraveling package, to Hindi during the DARPA TIDES-2003 Surprise Language Exercise. We show that it is possible to port DUSTer to Hindi in under 3 days.
