Today, parallel corpus-based systems dominate the transliteration landscape. But the resource-scarce languages do not enjoy the luxury of large parallel transliteration corpus. For these languages, rule-based transliteration is the only viable option. In this article, we show that by properly harnessing the monolingual resources in conjunction with manually created rule base, one can achieve reasonable transliteration performance. We achieve this performance by exploiting the power of Character Sequence Modeling (CSM), which requires only monolingual resources. We present the results of our rule-based system for Hindi to English, English to Hindi, and Persian to English transliteration tasks. We also perform extrinsic evaluation of transliteration systems in the context of Cross Lingual Information Retrieval. Another important contribution of our work is to explain the widely varying accuracy numbers reported in transliteration literature, in terms of the entropy of the language pairs and the datasets involved.
