Expressions of negation in the biomedical literature often encode information of contrast as a means for explaining significant differences between the objects that are so contrasted. We show that such information gives additional insights into the nature of the structures and/or biological functions of these objects, leading to valuable knowledge for subcategorization of protein families by the properties that the involved proteins do not have in common. Based on the observation that the expressions of negation employ mostly predictable syntactic structures that can be characterized by subclausal coordination and by clause-level parallelism, we present a system that extracts such contrastive information by identifying those syntactic structures with natural language processing techniques and with additional linguistic resources for semantics. The implemented system shows the performance of 85.7&percnt; precision and 61.5&percnt; recall, including 7.7&percnt; partial recall, or an F score of 76.6. We apply the system to the biological interactions as extracted by our biomedical information-extraction system in order to enrich proteome databases with contrastive information.
