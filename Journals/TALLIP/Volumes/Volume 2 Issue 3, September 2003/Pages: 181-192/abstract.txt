We developed a cross-lingual, question-answering (CLQA) system for Hindi and English. It accepts questions in English, finds candidate answers in Hindi newspapers, and translates the answer candidates into English along with the context surrounding each answer. The system was developed as part of the surprise language exercise (SLE) within the TIDES program.
