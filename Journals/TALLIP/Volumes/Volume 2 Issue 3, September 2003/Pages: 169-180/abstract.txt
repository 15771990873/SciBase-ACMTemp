Empirical results are presented for creating training data and training a statistical name learning algorithm on Cebuano and Hindi in roughly three weeks time. The empirical study compares performance in a compressed time frame against performance of the same statistical language model in English (where there was no compressed time frame). Rapid development of several co-reference heuristics in Hindi are also described, and co-reference performance in Hindi is compared to previously developed English techniques.
