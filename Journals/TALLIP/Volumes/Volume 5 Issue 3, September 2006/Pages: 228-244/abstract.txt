We propose a method for labelling prepositional phrases according to two different semantic role classifications, as contained in the Penn treebank and the CoNLL 2004 Semantic Role Labeling data set. Our results illustrate the difficulties in determining preposition semantics, but also demonstrate the potential for PP semantic role labelling to improve the performance of a holistic semantic role labelling system.
