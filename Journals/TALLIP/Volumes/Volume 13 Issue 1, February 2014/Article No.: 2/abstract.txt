This article proposes a new distortion model for phrase-based statistical machine translation. In decoding, a distortion model estimates the source word position to be translated next (subsequent position; SP) given the last translated source word position (current position; CP). We propose a distortion model that can simultaneously consider the word at the CP, the word at an SP candidate, the context of the CP and an SP candidate, relative word order among the SP candidates, and the words between the CP and an SP candidate. These considered elements are calledrich context. Our model considers rich context by discriminating label sequences that specify spans from the CP to each SP candidate. It enables our model to learn the effect of relative word order among SP candidates as well as to learn the effect of distances from the training data. In contrast to the learning strategy of existing methods, our learning strategy is that the model learns preference relations among SP candidates in each sentence of the training data. This leaning strategy enables consideration of all of the rich context simultaneously. In our experiments, our model had higher BLUE and RIBES scores for Japanese-English, Chinese-English, and German-English translation compared to the lexical reordering models.
