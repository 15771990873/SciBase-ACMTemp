The runtime application domain has a great effect on the performance of practical corpus-based applications. Previous smoothing techniques and class-based and similarity-based models could not handle the dynamic status perfectly. In this paper, an adaptive learning algorithm is proposed for task adaptation that best fits the runtime application domain in applying Chinese homophone disambiguation. The proposed algorithm is first formulated by a neural network model and then generalized to avoid the problem of slow convergence. The resulting techniques are greatly simplified and robust. The experimental results demonstrate the effects of the learning algorithm from a generic domain to a specific one. A methodology is also presented to show how these techniques can be extended to various language models and corpus-based applications.
