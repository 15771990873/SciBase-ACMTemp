Parallel corpora are crucial for statistical machine translation (SMT); however, they are quite scarce for most language pairs and domains. As comparable corpora are far more available, many studies have been conducted to extract either parallel sentences or fragments from them for SMT. In this article, we propose an integrated system to extract both parallel sentences and fragments from comparable corpora. We first apply parallel sentence extraction to identify parallel sentences from comparable sentences. We then extract parallel fragments from the comparable sentences. Parallel sentence extraction is based on a parallel sentence candidate filter and classifier for parallel sentence identification. We improve it by proposing a novel filtering strategy and three novel feature sets for classification. Previous studies have found it difficult to accurately extract parallel fragments from comparable sentences. We propose an accurate parallel fragment extraction method that uses an alignment model to locate the parallel fragment candidates and an accurate lexicon-based filter to identify the truly parallel fragments. A case study on the Chinese--Japanese Wikipedia indicates that our proposed methods outperform previously proposed methods, and the parallel data extracted by our system significantly improves SMT performance.
