Allomorphic variation, or form variation among morphs with the same meaning, is a stumbling block to morphological induction (MI). To address this problem, we present a hybrid approach that uses a small amount of linguistic knowledge in the form of orthographic rewrite rules to help refine an existing MI-produced segmentation. Using rules, we derive underlying analyses of morphs---generalized with respect to contextual spelling differences---from an existing surface morph segmentation, and from these we learn a morpheme-level segmentation. To learn morphemes, we have extended the Morfessor segmentation algorithm [Creutz and Lagus 2004; 2005; 2006] by using rules to infer possible underlying analyses from surface segmentations. A segmentation produced by Morfessor Categories-MAP Software v. 0.9.2 is used as input to our procedure and as a baseline that we evaluate against. To suggest analyses for our procedure, a set of language-specific orthographic rules is needed. Our procedure has yielded promising improvements for English and Turkish over the baseline approach when tested on the Morpho Challenge 2005 and 2007 style evaluations. On the Morpho Challenge 2007 test evaluation, we report gains over the current best unsupervised contestant for Turkish, where our technique shows a 2.5&percnt; absoluteF-score improvement.
