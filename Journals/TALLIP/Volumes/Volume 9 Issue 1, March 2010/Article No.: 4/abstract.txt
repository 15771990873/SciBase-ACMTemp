This article reconsiders the task of MRD-based word sense disambiguation, in extending the basic Lesk algorithm to investigate the impact on WSD performance of different tokenization schemes and methods of definition extension. In experimentation over the Hinoki Sensebank and the Japanese Senseval-2 dictionary task, we demonstrate that sense-sensitive definition extension over hyponyms, hypernyms, and synonyms, combined with definition extension and word tokenization leads to WSD accuracy above both unsupervised and supervised baselines. In doing so, we demonstrate the utility of ontology induction and establish new opportunities for the development of baseline unsupervised WSD methods.
