We propose a novel framework for Chinese Spelling Check (CSC), which is an automatic algorithm to detect and correct Chinese spelling errors. Our framework contains two key components:candidate generationandcandidate ranking. Our framework differs from previous research, such as Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) based model or Language Model (LM) based model, in that we use both SMT and LM models as components of our framework for generating the correction candidates, in order to obtain maximum recall; to improve the precision, we further employ a Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier to rank the candidates generated by the SMT and the LM. Experiments show that our framework outperforms other systems, which adopted the same or similar resources as ours in the SIGHAN 7 shared task; even comparing with the state-of-the-art systems, which used more resources, such as a considerable large dictionary, an idiom dictionary and other semantic information, our framework still obtains competitive results. Furthermore, to address the resource scarceness problem for training the SMT model, we generate around 2 million artificial training sentences using the Chinese character confusion sets, which include a set of Chinese characters with similar shapes and similar pronunciations, provided by the SIGHAN 7 shared task.
