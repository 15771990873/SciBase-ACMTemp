The large numbers of Chinese calligraphic scripts in existence are valuable part of the Chinese cultural heritage. However, due to the shape complexity of these characters, it is hard to employ existing techniques to effectively retrieve and efficiently index them. In this article, using a novel shape-similarity- based retrieval method in which shapes of calligraphic characters are represented by their contour points extracted from the character images, we propose an interactivepartial-distance-map(PDM)- based high-dimensional indexing scheme which is designed specifically to speed up the retrieval performance of the large Chinese calligraphic character databases effectively. Specifically, we use the approximate minimal bounding sphere of a query character and utilize users' relevance feedback to refine the query gradually. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to testify the efficiency and effectiveness of this method. In addition, a newk-NN search called Pseudok-NN (Pk-NN) search is presented to better facilitate the PDM-based character retrieval.
