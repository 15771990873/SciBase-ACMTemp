This article proposes an approach for the automatic extraction of transliteration pairs from Chinese Web corpora. In this approach, we formulate the machine transliteration process using a syllable-based phonetic similarity model which consists of phonetic confusion matrices and a Chinese charactern-gram language model. With the phonetic similarity model, the extraction of transliteration pairs becomes a two-step process ofrecognition followed by validation:First, in therecognitionprocess, we identify the most probable transliteration in thek-neighborhood of a recognized English word. Then, in thevalidationprocess, we qualify the transliteration pair candidates with a hypothesis test. We carry out an analytical study on the statistics of several key factors in English-Chinese transliteration to help formulate phonetic similarity modeling. We then conduct both supervised and unsupervised learning of a phonetic similarity model on a development database. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the phonetic similarity model by achieving anF-measure of 0.739 in supervised learning. The unsupervised learning approach works almost as well as the supervised one, thus allowing us to deploy automatic extraction of transliteration pairs in the Web space.
