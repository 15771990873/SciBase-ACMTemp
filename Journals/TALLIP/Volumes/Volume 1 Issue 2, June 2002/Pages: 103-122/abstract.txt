A WordNet-like linguistic resource is useful, but difficult to construct. This article proposes a method to integrate five linguistic resources, including English/Chinese sense-tagged corpora, English/Chinese thesauruses, and a bilingual dictionary. Chinese words are mapped into WordNet. A Chinese WordNet and a Chinese-English WordNet are derived by following the structures of WordNet. Experiments with Chinese-English information retrieval are developed to evaluate the applicability of the Chinese-English WordNet. The best model achieves 0.1010 average precision, 69.23% of monolingual information retrieval. It also gains a 10.02% increase relative to a model that resolves translation ambiguity and target polysemy problems together.
