This article presents an approach to automatically extracting translations of Web query terms through mining of Web anchor texts and link structures. One of the existing difficulties in cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) and Web search is the lack of appropriate translations of new terminology and proper names. The proposed approach successfully exploits the anchor-text resources and reduces the existing difficulties of query term translation. Many query terms that cannot be obtained in general-purpose translation dictionaries are, therefore, extracted.
