This article proposes a novel reordering method for efficient two-step Japanese-to-English statistical machine translation (SMT) that isolates reordering from SMT and solves it after lexical translation. This reordering problem, calledpost-ordering, is solved as an SMT problem from Head-Final English (HFE) to English. HFE is syntax-based reordered English that is very successfully used for reordering with English-to-Japanese SMT. The proposed method incorporates its advantage into the reverse direction, Japanese-to-English, and solves the post-ordering problem by accurate syntax-based SMT with target language syntax. Two-step SMT with the proposed post-ordering empirically reduces the decoding time of the accurate but slow syntax-based SMT by its good approximation using intermediate HFE. The proposed method improves the decoding speed of syntax-based SMT decoding by about six times with comparable translation accuracy in Japanese-to-English patent translation experiments.
