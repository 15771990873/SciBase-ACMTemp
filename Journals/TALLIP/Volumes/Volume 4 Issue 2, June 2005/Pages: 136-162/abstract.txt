We report on Korean monolingual, Chinese-Korean English-as-pivot bilingual, and Chinese-English bilingual CLIR experiments using MT software augmented with Web-based entity-oriented translation as resources in the NTCIR-4 environment. Simple stemming is helpful in improving bigram indexing for Korean retrieval. For word indexing, keeping nouns only is preferable. Web-based translation reduces untranslated terms left over after MT and substantially improves CLIR results. Translation concatenation is found to consistently improve CLIR effectiveness, while combining a retrieval list from bigram and word indexing is also helpful. A method to disambiguate multiple MT outputs using a log likelihood ratio threshold was tested. Depending on the nature of the title or description queries, bigram only or a retrieval combination, or relaxed or rigid evaluations, direct bilingual CLIR returned an average precision of 71--79&percnt; (English-Korean) and 76--84&percnt; (Chinese-English) of the corresponding Korean-Korean and English-English monolingual results. Using English as a pivot in Chinese-Korean CLIR provides about 55--65&percnt; the effectiveness that Korean alone does. Entity/terminology translation at the pivot language stage accounts for a large portion of this deficiency. A topic with comparatively worse Chinese-English bilingual result does not necessarily mean that it will continue to under-perform (after further transitive Korean translation) at the Korean retrieval level.
