Ancient language manuscripts constitute a key part of the cultural heritage of mankind. As one of the most important languages, Chinese historical calligraphy work has contributed to not only the Chinese cultural heritage but also the world civilization at large, especially for Asia. To support deeper and more convenient appreciation of Chinese calligraphy works, based on our previous work on the probabilistic retrieval of historical Chinese calligraphic character manuscripts repositories, we propose a system framework of the multi-feature-based Chinese calligraphic character images probabilistic retrieval in the mobile cloud network environment, which is called theDPRC. To ensure retrieval efficiency, we further propose four enabling techniques: (1) DRL-based probability propagation, (2) optimal data placement scheme, (3) adaptive data robust transmission algorithm, and (4) index support filtering scheme. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to testify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposedDPRCmethod.
