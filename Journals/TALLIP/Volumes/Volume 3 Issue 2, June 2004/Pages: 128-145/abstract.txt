In recent years, statistical modeling approaches have steadily gained in popularity in the field of information retrieval. This article presents an HMM/N-gram-based retrieval approach for Mandarin spoken documents. The underlying characteristics and the various structures of this approach were extensively investigated and analyzed. The retrieval capabilities were verified by tests with word- and syllable-level indexing features and comparisons to the conventional vector-space model approach. To further improve the discrimination capabilities of the HMMs, both the expectation-maximization (EM) and minimum classification error (MCE) training algorithms were introduced in training. Fusion of information via indexing word- and syllable-level features was also investigated. The spoken document retrieval experiments were performed on the Topic Detection and Tracking Corpora (TDT-2 and TDT-3). Very encouraging retrieval performance was obtained.
