Sentence reduction is the removal of redundant words or phrases from an input sentence by creating a new sentence in which the gist of the original meaning of the sentence remains unchanged. All previous methods required a syntax parser before sentences could be reduced; hence it was difficult to apply them to a language with no reliable parser. In this article we propose two new sentence-reduction algorithms that do not use syntactic parsing for the input sentence. The first algorithm, based on the template-translation learning algorithm, one of example-based machine-translation methods, works quite well in reducing sentences, but its computational complexity can be exponential in certain cases. The second algorithm, an extension of the template--translation algorithm via innovative employment of the Hidden Markov model, which uses the set of template rules learned from examples, can overcome this computation problem. Experiments show that the proposed algorithms achieve acceptable results in comparison to sentence reduction done by humans.
