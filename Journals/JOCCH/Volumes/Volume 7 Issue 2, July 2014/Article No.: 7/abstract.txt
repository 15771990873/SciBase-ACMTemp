As buildings from ancient times wither away or are transformed or destroyed, it becomes increasingly difficult to figure what it looked like back then. Virtual reality is a great tool to handle this role, although it often implies a three-dimensional model of a building disconnected from the remains. In this article, we present an on-site device dedicated to architectural heritage, which uses realistic photometric rendering associated with the reproduction of the userâ€™s point of view in the virtual scene to immerse him in the uchronic virtual world while maintaining the link to the real site. This design is already in use at the old church of Cluny (France), where is it was welcomed by tourists and guides.
