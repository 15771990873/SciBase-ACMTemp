In this article, we present an approach for a deep-sea survey based on photogrammetry using a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV). A hybrid technique gives us real-time results, sufficient for piloting the ROV from the surface vessel and ensuring a uniform coverage of the site, as well as recording high-definition images using an onboard computer that will later provide a survey with millimetric precision. The measurements are made without any contact and are noninvasive. The time required on-site is minimal and corresponds to the time needed by the ROV to cover the zone. With the photos taken at a frame rate synchronized at 10Hz, the ROV required 2 hours to perform the experiment presented in this article: the survey of the Roman shipwreckCap Bénat 4, at a depth of 328m. The approach presented in this work was developed in the scope of the ROV 3D project. This project, financed by the Fond Unique Interministériel (FUI) for 3 years, brings together two industrial partners and a research laboratory. Companie Maritime d’Expertise (COMEX) coordinated this project.
