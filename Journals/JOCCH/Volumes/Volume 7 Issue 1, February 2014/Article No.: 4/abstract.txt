This article introduces the study contents and some research findings regarding digital preservation methods for ChineseKunquopera libretto historical literature, including historical literature electronic libretto transformation, libretto musical score image segmentation, musical information recognition, musical score information representation, musical score information storage, and libretto reconstruction on the Web. It proposes a novel editable text method to represent the multidimensional tree-like information structure of theKunqulibretto literature and a musical semantic annotation method based on numbered musical notation to accommodate the musical features ofKunqulibrettos. To maintain the characteristics of the originalKunqumusical notation, it proposes a method to reconstructKunqulibretto on the Web based on scalable vector graphics. SomeKunqulibrettos were randomly selected for experiments, and the results demonstrated that the editable text method and the musical semantic annotation method were able to fully represent the effective information of theKunqulibretto literature and that the method to reconstruct librettos on the Web was able to reflect the writing characteristics of the musical notation in the original librettos. Finally, it discusses the primary future research directions related to digitalKunqu, includingKunqulibretto metadata research, corpus construction for the librettos andQupai(the unique ancient Chinese tune mode), libretto music information disambiguation research, libretto image segmentation and pattern recognition, digitalKunquroles, digitalKunqustages, digitalKunqucostume suitcases, virtualKunqu, digitization and restoration ofKunqucultural relics, andKunqu's application prospects in conventional media such as animation, anime, and movies.
