A large body of work has been devoted to address corporate-scale privacy concerns related to social networks. Most of this work focuses on how to share social networks owned by organizations without revealing the identities or the sensitive relationships of the users involved. Not much attention has been given to the privacy risk of users posed by their daily information-sharing activities.In this article, we approach the privacy issues raised in online social networks from the individual users’ viewpoint: we propose a framework to compute the privacy score of a user. This score indicates the user’s potential risk caused by his or her participation in the network. Our definition of privacy score satisfies the following intuitive properties: the more sensitive information a user discloses, the higher his or her privacy risk. Also, the more visible the disclosed information becomes in the network, the higher the privacy risk. We develop mathematical models to estimate bothsensitivityandvisibilityof the information. We apply our methods to synthetic and real-world data and demonstrate their efficacy and practical utility.
