Recommender systems have been studied comprehensively in both academic and industrial fields over the past decade. As user interests can be affected by context at any time and any place in mobile scenarios, rich context information becomes more and more important for personalized context-aware recommendations. Although existing context-aware recommender systems can make context-aware recommendations to some extent, they suffer several inherent weaknesses: (1) Users’ context-aware interests are not modeled realistically, which reduces the recommendation quality; (2) Current context-aware recommender systems ignore trust relations among users. Trust relations are actually context-aware and associated with certain aspects (i.e., categories of items) in mobile scenarios. In this article, we define a termroleto model common context-aware interests among a group of users. We propose an efficient role mining algorithm to mine roles from a “user-context-behavior” matrix, and a role-based trust model to calculate context-aware trust value between two users. During online recommendation, given a useruin a contextc, an efficient weighted set similarity query (WSSQ) algorithm is designed to buildu’srole-based trust networkin contextc. Finally, we make recommendations toubased onu’s role-based trust network by considering both context-aware roles and trust relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our recommendation approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both effectiveness and efficiency.
