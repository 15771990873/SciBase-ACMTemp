We examine the problem of identifying social circles, or sets of cohesive and mutually aware nodes surrounding an initial query set, in directed graphs where the complete graph is not known beforehand. This problem differs from local community mining, in that the query set defines the circle of interest. We explicitly handle edge direction, as in many cases relationships are not symmetric, and focus on the local context because many real-world graphs cannot be feasibly known. We outline several issues that are unique to this context, introduce a quality function to measure the value of including a particular node in an emerging social circle, and describe a greedy social circle discovery algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on artificial benchmarks, large networks with topical community labels, and several real-world case studies.
