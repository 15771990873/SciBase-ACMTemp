During the last decade, microblog has become an important social networking service with billions of users all over the world, acting as a novel and efficient platform for the creation and dissemination of real-time information. Modeling and revealing the information propagation patterns in microblogging services cannot only lead to more accurate understanding of user behaviors and provide insights into the underlying sociology, but also enable useful applications such as trending prediction, recommendation and filtering, spam detection and viral marketing. In this article, we aim to reveal the information propagation patterns in Sina Weibo, the biggest microblogging service in China. First, the cascade of each message is represented as a tree based on its retweeting process. Afterwards, we divide the information propagation pattern into two levels, that is, the macro level and the micro level. On one hand, the macro propagation patterns refer to general propagation modes that are extracted by grouping propagation trees based on hierarchical clustering. On the other hand, the micro propagation patterns are frequent information flow patterns that are discovered using tree-based mining techniques. Experimental results show that several interesting patterns are extracted, such as popular message propagation, artificial propagation, and typical information flows between different types of users.
