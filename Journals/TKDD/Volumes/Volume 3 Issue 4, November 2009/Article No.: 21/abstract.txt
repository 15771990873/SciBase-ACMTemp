Event sequences capture system and user activity over time. Prior research on sequence mining has mostly focused on discovering local patterns appearing in a sequence. While interesting, these patterns do not give a comprehensive summary of the entire event sequence. Moreover, the number of patterns discovered can be large. In this article, we take an alternative approach and buildshortsummaries that describe an entire sequence, and discover local dependencies between event types.We formally define the summarization problem as an optimization problem that balances shortness of the summary with accuracy of the data description. We show that this problem can be solved optimally in polynomial time by using a combination of two dynamic-programming algorithms. We also explore more efficient greedy alternatives and demonstrate that they work well on large datasets. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets illustrate that our algorithms are efficient and produce high-quality results, and reveal interesting local structures in the data.
