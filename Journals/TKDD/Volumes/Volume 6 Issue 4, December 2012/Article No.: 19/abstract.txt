In Wilkinson et al. [2011] we introduced a new set-covering random projection classifier that achieved average error lower than that of other classifiers in the Weka platform. This classifier was based on anL&infty;norm distance function and exploited an iterative sequence of three stages (projecting, binning, and covering) to deal with the curse of dimensionality, computational complexity, and nonlinear separability. We now present substantial changes that improve robustness and reduce training and testing time by almost an order of magnitude without jeopardizing CHIRP's outstanding error performance.
