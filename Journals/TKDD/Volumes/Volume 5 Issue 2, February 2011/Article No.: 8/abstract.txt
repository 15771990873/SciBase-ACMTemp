Given large, multimillion-node graphs (e.g., Facebook, Web-crawls, etc.), how do they evolve over time? How are they connected? What are the central nodes and the outliers? In this article we define the Radius plot of a graph and show how it can answer these questions. However, computing the Radius plot is prohibitively expensive for graphs reaching the planetary scale.There are two major contributions in this article: (a) We propose HADI (HAdoop DIameter and radii estimator), a carefully designed and fine-tuned algorithm to compute the radii and the diameter of massive graphs, that runs on the top of theHadoop/MapReducesystem, with excellent scale-up on the number of available machines (b) We run HADI on several real world datasets including YahooWeb (6B edges, 1/8 of a Terabyte), one of the largest public graphs ever analyzed.Thanks to HADI, we report fascinating patterns on large networks, like the surprisingly small effective diameter, the multimodal/bimodal shape of the Radius plot, and its palindrome motion over time.
