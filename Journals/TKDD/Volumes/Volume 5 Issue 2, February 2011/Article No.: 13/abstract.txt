A low-rank approximation to a matrixAis a matrix with significantly smaller rank thanA, and which is close toAaccording to some norm. Many practical applications involving the use of large matrices focus on low-rank approximations. By reducing the rank or dimensionality of the data, we reduce the complexity of analyzing the data. The singular value decomposition is the most popular low-rank matrix approximation. However, due to its expensive computational requirements, it has often been considered intractable for practical applications involving massive data. Recent developments have tried to address this problem, with several methods proposed to approximate the decomposition with better asymptotic runtime. We present an empirical study of these techniques on a variety of dense and sparse datasets. We find that a sampling approach of Drineas, Kannan and Mahoney is often, but not always, the best performing method. This method gives solutions with high accuracy much faster than classical SVD algorithms, on large sparse datasets in particular. Other modern methods, such as a recent algorithm by Rokhlin and Tygert, also offer savings compared to classical SVD algorithms. The older sampling methods of Achlioptas and McSherry are shown to sometimes take longer than classical SVD.
