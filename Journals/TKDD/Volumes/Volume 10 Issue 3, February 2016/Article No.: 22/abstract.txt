Community detection has arisen as one of the most relevant topics in the field of graph data mining due to its applications in many fields such as biology, social networks, or network traffic analysis. Although the existing metrics used to quantify the quality of a community work well in general, under some circumstances, they fail at correctly capturing such notion. The main reason is that these metrics consider the internal community edges as a set, but ignore how these actually connect the vertices of the community. We propose the Weighted Community Clustering (WCC), which is a new community metric that takes the triangle instead of the edge as the minimal structural motif indicating the presence of a strong relation in a graph. We theoretically analyseWCCin depth and formally prove, by means of a set of properties, that the maximization ofWCCguarantees communities with cohesion and structure. In addition, we proposeScalable Community Detection (SCD), a community detection algorithm based onWCC, which is designed to be fast and scalable on SMP machines, showing experimentally thatWCCcorrectly captures the concept of community in social networks using real datasets. Finally, using ground-truth data, we show thatSCDprovides better quality than the best disjoint community detection algorithms of the state of the art while performing faster.
