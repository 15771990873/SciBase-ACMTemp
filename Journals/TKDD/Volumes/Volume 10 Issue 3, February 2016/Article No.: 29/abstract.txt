We present in this article an automated framework that extracts product adopter information from online reviews and incorporates the extracted information into feature-based matrix factorization for more effective product recommendation. In specific, we propose a bootstrapping approach for the extraction of product adopters from review text and categorize them into a number of different demographic categories. The aggregated demographic information of many product adopters can be used to characterize both products and users in the form of distributions over different demographic categories. We further propose a graph-based method to iteratively update user- and product-related distributions more reliably in a heterogeneous user--product graph and incorporate them as features into the matrix factorization approach for product recommendation. Our experimental results on a large dataset crawled from JingDong, the largest B2C e-commerce website in China, show that our proposed framework outperforms a number of competitive baselines for product recommendation.
