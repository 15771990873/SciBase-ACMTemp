Traditional process discovery techniques mine process models based upon event traces giving little consideration to workflow relevant data recorded in event logs. The neglect of such information usually leads to incorrect discovered models, especially when activities have decomposable cyclic dependencies. To address this problem, the recorded workflow relevant data and decision tree learning technique are utilized to classify cases into case clusters. Each case cluster contains causality and concurrency activity dependencies only. Then, a set of activity ordering relations are derived based on case clusters. And a synchronization-core-based process model is discovered from the ordering relations and composite cases. Finally, the discovered model is transformed to a BPMN model. The proposed approach is validated with a medical treatment process and an open event log. Meanwhile, a prototype system is presented.
