We present an approach to leverage a small subset of a coherent community within a social network into a much larger, more representative sample. Our problem becomes identifying a small conductance subgraph containing many (but not necessarily all) members of the given seed set. Starting with an initial seed set representing a sample of a community, we seek to discover as much of the full community as possible.We present a general method for network community expansion, demonstrating that our methods work well in expanding communities in real world networks starting from small given seed groups (20 to 400 members). Our approach is marked by incremental expansion from the seeds with retrospective analysis to determine the ultimate boundaries of our community. We demonstrate how to increase the robustness of the general approach through bootstrapping multiple random partitions of the input set into seed and evaluation groups.We go beyond statistical comparisons against gold standards to careful subjective evaluations of our expanded communities. This process explains the causes of most disagreement between our expanded communities and our gold-standardsâ€”arguing that our expansion methods provide more reliable communities than can be extracted from reference sources/gazetteers such as Wikipedia.
