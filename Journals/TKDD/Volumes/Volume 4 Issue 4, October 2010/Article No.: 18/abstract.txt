Sharing healthcare data has become a vital requirement in healthcare system management; however, inappropriate sharing and usage of healthcare data could threaten patientsâ€™ privacy. In this article, we study the privacy concerns of sharing patient information between the Hong Kong Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service (BTS) and the public hospitals. We generalize their information and privacy requirements to the problems ofcentralized anonymizationanddistributed anonymization, and identify the major challenges that make traditional data anonymization methods not applicable. Furthermore, we propose a new privacy model calledLKC-privacyto overcome the challenges and present two anonymization algorithms to achieve LKC-privacy in both the centralized and the distributed scenarios. Experiments on real-life data demonstrate that our anonymization algorithms can effectively retain the essential information in anonymous data for data analysis and is scalable for anonymizing large datasets.
