Due to the inherent flexibilities in both structure and semantics, XML association rules mining faces few challenges, such as: a more complicated hierarchical data structure and ordered data context. Mining frequent patterns from XML documents can be recast as mining frequent tree structures from a database of XML documents. In this study, we model a database of XML documents as a database of rooted labeled ordered subtrees. In particular, we are mainly concerned with mining frequent induced and embedded ordered subtrees. Our main contributions are as follows. We describe our uniqueembedding listrepresentation of the tree structure, which enables efficient implementation of ourTree Model Guided(TMG) candidate generation.TMGis an optimal, nonredundant enumeration strategy that enumerates all the valid candidates that conform to the structural aspects of the data. We show through a mathematical model and experiments thatTMGhas better complexity compared to the commonly used join approach. In this article, we propose two algorithms, MB3-Miner and iMB3-Miner. MB3-Miner mines embedded subtrees. iMB3-Miner mines induced and/or embedded subtrees by using themaximum level of embedding constraint. Our experiments with both synthetic and real datasets against two well-known algorithms for mining induced and embedded subtrees, demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed techniques.
