Exploring statistics of locally connected subgraph patterns (also known as network motifs) has helped researchers better understand the structure and function of biological and Online Social Networks (OSNs). Nowadays, the massive size of some critical networks—often stored in already overloaded relational databases—effectively limits the rate at which nodes and edges can be explored, making it a challenge to accurately discover subgraph statistics. In this work, we proposesampling methodsto accurately estimate subgraph statistics from as few queried nodes as possible. We present sampling algorithms that efficiently and accurately estimate subgraph properties of massive networks. Our algorithms require no precomputation or complete network topology information. At the same time, we provide theoretical guarantees of convergence. We perform experiments using widely known datasets and show that, for the same accuracy, our algorithms require an order of magnitude less queries (samples) than the current state-of-the-art algorithms.
