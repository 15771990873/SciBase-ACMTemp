In two experiments, visual cues from gesture control of spatialization were found to affect auditory movement perception depending on the identifiability of auditory motion trajectories, the congruency of audiovisual stimulation, the sensory focus of attention, and the attentional process involved. Visibility of the performer’s gestures improved spatial audio trajectory identification, but it shifted the listeners’ attention to vision, impairing auditory motion encoding in the case of incongruent stimulation. On the other hand, selectively directing attention to audition resulted in interference from the visual cues for acoustically ambiguous trajectories. Auditory motion information was poorly preserved when dividing attention between auditory and visual movement feedback from performance gestures. An auditory focus of attention is a listener strategy that maximizes performance, due to the improvement caused by congruent visual stimulation and its robustness to interference from incongruent stimulation for acoustically unambiguous trajectories. Attentional strategy and auditory motion calibration are two aspects that need to be considered when employing gesture control of spatialization.
