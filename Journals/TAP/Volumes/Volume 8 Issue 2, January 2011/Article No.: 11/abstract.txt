We present a method for image interpolation that is able to create high-quality, perceptually convincing transitions between recorded images. By implementing concepts derived from human vision, the problem of a physically correct image interpolation is relaxed to that of image interpolation which is perceived as visually correct by human observers. We find that it suffices to focus on exact edge correspondences, homogeneous regions and coherent motion to compute convincing results. A user study confirms the visual quality of the proposed image interpolation approach. We show how each aspect of our approach increases perceived quality of the result. We compare the results to other methods and assess achievable quality for different types of scenes.
