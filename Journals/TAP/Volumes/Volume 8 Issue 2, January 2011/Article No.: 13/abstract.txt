Controlling computers using eye movements can provide a fast and efficient alternative to the computer mouse. However, implementing object selection in gaze-controlled systems is still a challenge. Dwell times or fixations on a certain object typically used to elicit the selection of this object show several disadvantages. We studied deviations of critical thresholds by an individual and task-specific adaptation method. This demonstrated an enormous variability of optimal dwell times. We developed an alternative approach using antisaccades for selection. For selection by antisaccades, highlighted objects are copied to one side of the object. The object is selected when fixating to the side opposed to that copy requiring to inhibit an automatic gaze shift toward new objects. Both techniques were compared in a selection task. Two experiments revealed superior performance in terms of errors for the individually adapted dwell times. Antisaccades provide an alternative approach to dwell time selection, but they did not show an improvement over dwell time. We discuss potential improvements in the antisaccade implementation with which antisaccades might become a serious alternative to dwell times for object selection in gaze-controlled systems.
