We conducted a series of experiments to investigate effects of scale changes on distance perception in virtual environments. All experiments were carried out in an HMD. Participants first made distance estimates with feedback in a virtual tunnel (adaptation) and then made distance estimates without feedback in a differently-scaled virtual environment (test). We examined several types of scale changes, including changing the size of (1) the tunnel, (2) the targets, and (3) the separation of the two targets. Changes in target size always affected distance estimates at test. When the targets became smaller, participants overshot distance and when the targets became larger, participants undershot distance. Changes in the size of the tunnel or the separation between the targets (without a change in the size of the targets) had a minimal effect on distance estimates. These results indicate that distance estimates at test were strongly influenced by familiar size cues for distance. The discussion focuses on the stability of calibration processes and mechanisms for cue integration for perceiving distance in virtual environments.
