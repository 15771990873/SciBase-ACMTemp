In modern computer graphics applications, textures play an important role in conveying the appearance of real-world materials. But while surface appearance can often be effectively captured with a photograph, it is difficult to use example imagery to synthesize fully three-dimensional (3D) solid textures that are perceptually similar to their inputs. Specifically, this research focuses on human perception of 3D solid textures composed of aggregate particles in a binding matrix. Holding constant an established algorithm for approximating particledistributions, we examine the problem of estimating particleshape. We consider four methods for approximating plausible particle shapesâ€”including two methods of our own contribution. We compare the performance of these methods under a variety of input conditions using automated, perceptually motivated metrics, as well as a psychophysical experiment. In the course of assessing the relative performance of the four algorithms, we also evaluate the reliability of the automated metrics in predicting the results of the experiment.
