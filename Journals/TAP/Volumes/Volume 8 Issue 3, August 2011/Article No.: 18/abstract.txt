Few experiments have been performed to investigate near-field egocentric distance estimation in an Immersive Virtual Environment (IVE) as compared to the Real World (RW). This article investigates near-field distance estimation in IVEs and RW conditions using physical reach and verbal report measures, by using an apparatus similar to that used by Bingham and Pagano [1998]. Analysis of our experiment shows distance compression in both the IVE and RW conditions in participants' perceptual judgments to targets. This is consistent with previous research in both action space in an IVE and reach space with Augmented Reality (AR). Analysis of verbal responses from participants revealed that participants underestimated significantly less in the virtual world as compared to the RW. We also found that verbal reports and reaches provided different results in both IVEs and RW environments.
