In this work, we present a method of “Walking In Place” (WIP) on the Nintendo Wii Fit Balance Board to explore a virtual environment. We directly compare our method to joystick locomotion and normal walking. The joystick proves inferior to physically walking and to WIP on the Wii Balance Board (WIP--Wii). Interestingly, we find that physically exploring an environment on foot is equivalent in terms of spatial orientation to exploring an environment using our WIP--Wii method. This implies that the WIP--Wii is a good inexpensive alternative to exploring a virtual environment and it may be well--suited for exploring large virtual environments.
