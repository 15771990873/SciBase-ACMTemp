The ability to judge heading (direction of travel) has been the focus of much research, but a role for perceived heading in steering has not been firmly established. Subjects steered down a road consisting of straight and curved segments and made heading judgments along the way. Heading judgments while traversing curved road segments were biased in the direction of the curve by up to 5Â° and position errors on the same curved roads were highly correlated with heading biases. This correlation was revealed by the simultaneous measurement of steering performance and perceived heading.
