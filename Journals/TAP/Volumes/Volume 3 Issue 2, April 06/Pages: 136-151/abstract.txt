The goal of this research is to use eyegaze tracking data to provide insights into designing radiology workstations. We designed a look-alike radiology task with artificial stimuli. The task involved a comparative visual search of two side-by-side images, using two different interaction techniques. We tracked the eyegaze of four radiologists while they performed the task and measured the duration of the fixations on the controls, the left and right images, and on the artificial targets. Response time differences between the two interaction techniques exceeded the differences of fixations on the controls. Fixations on the left-side images are longer than the right-side images, and the search for multifeatured targets occurs in two phases: first a regular scan path search phase for a likely target and then a confirmation phase of several fixations on the target in each side-by-side image. We conclude that eyegaze tracking shows that disruption of visual search leads to cognitive disruption; subjects use the left image as a reference image and multiple saccades between left and right side images are necessary, because of the limitations of the visual working memory.
