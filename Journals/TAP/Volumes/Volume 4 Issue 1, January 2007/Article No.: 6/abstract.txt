Three studies were conducted to examine whether men and women differ in how they recalibrate their path-integration systems when walking without vision in virtual environments. Distance cues provided by a scene and a tone, which ended each trial, were placed in conflict. Participants briefly viewed a room with a target, which was offset from their midlines and hung inside a doorframe on the far wall. After viewing, participants walked to the target's position until a tone sounded, ending the trial. In two experiments the doorframe was placed at 6 m and the tone sounded at 4 or 8 m. The rooms had minimal or photorealistic texturing applied. The third experiment used photorealistic texturing, but here the tone sounded at 6 m and the doorframe was presented at 4 or 8 m. Path angles were recorded to estimate perceived distance to the target. In all conditions tested, the women failed to scale their path angles. The men, however, scaled their path-angles with the auditory cue in the minimal-texture condition, but with the visual cue in the photorealistic-texture conditions. These results suggest that gender differences exist in the way that humans recalibrate their path-integration systems when walking without vision in virtual environments.
