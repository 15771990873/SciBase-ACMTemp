In this article we evaluate the use of approximate visibility for efficient global illumination. Traditionally, accurate visibility is used in light transport. However, the indirect illumination we perceive on a daily basis is rarely of high-frequency nature, as the most significant aspect of light transport in real-world scenes is diffuse, and thus displays a smooth gradation. This raises the question of whether accurate visibility is perceptually necessary in this case. To answer this question, we conduct a psychophysical study on the perceptual influence of approximate visibility on indirect illumination. This study reveals that accurate visibility is not required and that certain approximations may be introduced.
