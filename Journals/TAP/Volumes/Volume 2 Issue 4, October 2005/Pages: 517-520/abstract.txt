This commentary was written for the article “Data collection analysis techniques for evaluating the perceptual qualities of auditory stimuli” that was presented at theInternational Conference on Auditory Displayin 1998. The original paper was written as a primer for research design and statistical evaluation of perceptual responses to auditory displays as well as a catalyst for the formation of interdisciplinary teams for such research. The authors' commentary notes that the ICAD community has shown an increase in cross-disciplinary collaboration but that researchers need to continue to improve their research designs and their statistical techniques to ensure accurate evaluation of auditory displays.
