In our 2003 ICAD Paper “Optimizing the Spatial Configuration of a Seven Talker Speech Display,” we described a hybrid near-far spatial configuration that maximizes performance in a multitalker listening task. In this brief addendum, we describe our scientific motivation for that study, describe a supplementary experiment that extended the earlier work to two additional spatial configurations, and place the results of the study in the context of current and future research in audio displays.
