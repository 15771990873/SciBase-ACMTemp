In this paper, we reflect upon the investigations into external auditory representations of programs (program auralization) reported by Vickers and Alty at ICAD 2000. First, we place the work in its historical and thematic context and explore the motivation that lay behind it. We then outline the process by which we got to the stage of being able to report empirical results in 2000 and compare the work with that done by other researchers in the field. Finally, we assess the major contribution that this work made to the field of auditory display and look to the future outlining the work still to be done since the paper was first published (we also look at work done by others in this area since 2000).
