Spatial auditory displays have received a great deal of attention in the community investigating how to present information through sound. This short commentary discusses our 2001 ICAD paper (Shinn-Cunningham, Streeter, and Gyss), which explored whether it is possible to provide enhanced spatial auditory information in an auditory display. The discussion provides some historical context and discusses how work on representing information in spatial auditory displays has progressed over the last 5 years.
