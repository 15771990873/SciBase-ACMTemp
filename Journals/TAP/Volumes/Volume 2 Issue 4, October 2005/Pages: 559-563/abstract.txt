We discuss the framework of Model-Based Sonification (MBS) and its contribution to a principled design of mediators between high-dimensional data spaces and perceptual spaces, particularly sound spaces. Data Crystallization Sonification, discussed in the reprinted paper, exemplifies the design of sonification models according to this framework. Finally, promising lines of development in this area are pointed out, concerning generalizations, applications, and open research directions.
