The effectiveness of providing multiple-stream audio to support browsing on a computer was investigated through the iterative development and evaluation of a series ofsonic browserprototypes. The data set used was a database containing music. Interactive sonification was provided in conjunction with simplified human--computer interaction sequences. It was investigated to what extent interactive sonification with multiple-stream audio could enhance browsing tasks, compared to interactive sonification with single-stream audio support. It was found that with interactive multiple-stream audio, the ten users could accurately complete the browsing tasks significantly faster than those who had single-stream audio support.
