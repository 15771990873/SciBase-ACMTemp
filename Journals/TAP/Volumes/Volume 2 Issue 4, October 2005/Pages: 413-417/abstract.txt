The original Walker and Kramer paper at ICAD 1996 studied the mapping of data dimensions (e.g., temperature) onto sound dimensions (e.g., pitch). In this commentary we consider the historical and methodological context of that early work, discuss its relevance to the field of auditory display, and point out how it forms part of a body of work with ties to other researchers in the ICAD community.
