Sonification tools have not yet become typical components of data analysis software, despite dramatic advances in sound-production capabilities of personal computers over the past decade. However, we continue to believe that auditory displays have the potential to be highly useful for “small scale” exploration of data for normally sighted users as well as an alternative format for users with visual impairment. Demonstration of effective examples of auditory data displays and design offlexiblesoftware tools for data sonification will be key factors in determining the impact of this method of data representation.
