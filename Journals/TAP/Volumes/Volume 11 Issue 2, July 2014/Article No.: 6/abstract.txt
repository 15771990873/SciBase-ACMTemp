Visual perception is becoming increasingly important in computer graphics. Research on human visual perception has led to the development of perception-driven computer graphics techniques, where knowledge of the human visual system (HVS) and, in particular, its weaknesses are exploited when rendering and displaying 3D graphics. Findings on limitations of the HVS have been used to maintain high perceived quality but reduce the computed quality of some of the image without this quality difference being perceived. This article investigates the amount of time for which (if at all) such limitations could be exploited in the presence of smell. The results show that for our experiment, adaptation to smell does indeed affect participants’ ability to determine quality difference in the animations. Having been exposed to a smell before undertaking the experiment, participants were able to determine the quality in a similar fashion to the “no smell” condition, whereas without adaptation, participants were not able to distinguish the quality difference.
