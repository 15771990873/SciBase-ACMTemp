It is still an unsolved problem how to optimally simulate self-motion using motion simulators. We investigated how a forward acceleration can be simulated as believably as possible on a hexapod motion platform equipped with a projection screen.Human participants rated the believability of brief forward accelerations. These were simulated as visual forward accelerations over a ground plane with people as size cues, presented together with brief forward surge translations and backward pitches of the platform, and synchronous random up--down movements of the camera in the visual scene and the platform. The magnitudes of all of the parameters were varied independently across trials.Even though variability between participants was high, the most believable simulation occurred when visual accelerations were combined with backward pitches of the platform, which changed the gravitoinertial vector direction approximately consistent with the visual acceleration. However, a wide range of platform pitches was accepted as believable. With high visual acceleration cues most participants reported trials as realistic even when the platform tilt rate was above vestibular canal thresholds reported in other works. Other manipulated parameters had only a mild influence on the responses. These results can be used to optimize motion-cueing algorithms for simulating linear accelerations in motion simulators.
