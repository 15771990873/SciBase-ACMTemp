This article presents a method for automating rendering parameter selection to simplify tedious user interaction and improve the usability of visualization systems. Our approach acquires the important/interesting regions of a dataset through simple user interaction with an eye tracker. Based on this importance information, we automatically compute reasonable rendering parameters using a set of heuristic rules, which are adapted from visualization experience and psychophysical experiments. A user study has been conducted to evaluate these rendering parameters, and while the parameter selections for a specific visualization result are subjective, our approach provides good preliminary results for general users while allowing additional control adjustment. Furthermore, our system improves the interactivity of a visualization system by significantly reducing the required amount of parameter selections and providing good initial rendering parameters for newly acquired datasets of similar types.
