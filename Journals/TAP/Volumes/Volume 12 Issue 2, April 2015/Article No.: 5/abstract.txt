Presenting points of interest in the environment by means of audio augmented reality offers benefits compared with traditional visual augmented reality and map-based approaches. However, presentation of distant virtual sound sources is problematic. This study looks at combining well-known auditory distance cues to convey the distance of points of interest. The results indicate that although the provided cues are intuitively mapped to relatively short distances, users can with only little training learn to map these cues to larger distances.
