When a single column of light sources flashes quickly in a temporal pattern during a horizontal saccade eye movement, two-dimensional images can be perceived in the space neighboring the light source. This perceptual phenomenon has been applied to light devices for visual arts and entertainment. However, a serious drawback in exploiting this perceptual phenomenon for a visual information display is that a two-dimensional image cannot be viewed if there is any discrepancy between the ocular motility and the flicker timing. We overcame this drawback by combining the saccade-based display with an electro-ocular-graph-based sensor for detecting the saccade. The saccade onset is measured with the electro-ocular-graph-based sensor in real time and the saccade-based display is activated instantaneously as the saccade begins. The psychophysical experiments described in this article demonstrates that the method that we used can detect saccades with low latency and allows the saccade-based display to convey visual information more effectively than when the light sources continuously blink regardless of the observer's eye movements.
