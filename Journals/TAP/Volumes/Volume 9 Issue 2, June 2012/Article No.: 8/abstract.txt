Directional audio coding (DirAC) is a parametric time-frequency domain method for processing spatial audio based on psychophysical assumptions and on energetic analysis of the sound field. Methods to use DirAC in spatial sound synthesis for virtual worlds are presented in this article. Formal listening tests are used to show that DirAC can be used to position and to control the spatial extent of virtual sound sources with good audio quality. It is also shown that DirAC can be used to generate reverberation for N-channel horizontal listening with only two monophonic reverberators without a prominent loss in quality when compared with quality obtained with N-channel reverberators.
