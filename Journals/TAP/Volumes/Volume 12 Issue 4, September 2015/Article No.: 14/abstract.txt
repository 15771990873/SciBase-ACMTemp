With the increasing availability of high-dynamic-range (HDR) displays comes the need to remaster existing content in a way that takes advantage of the extended range of luminance and contrast that such displays offer. At the same time, it is crucial that the creative intent of the director is preserved through such changes as much as possible. In this article, we compare several approaches for dynamic range extension to assess their ability to correctly reproduce the color appearance of standard dynamic range (SDR) images on HDR displays. A number of state-of-the-art inverse tone mapping operators (ITMOs) combined with a standard chromatic adaptation transform (CAT) as well as some HDR color appearance models have been evaluated through a psychophysical study, making use of an HDR display as well as HDR ground-truth data. We found that global ITMOs lead to the most reliable performance when combined with a standard CAT, while more complex methods were found to be more scene dependent, and often less preferred than the unprocessed SDR image. HDR color appearance models, albeit being the most complete solutions for accurate color reproduction, were found to not be well suited to the problem of dynamic range expansion, suggesting that further research may be necessary to provide accurate color management in the context of inverse tone mapping.
