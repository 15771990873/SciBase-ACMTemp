This paper presents an initial study of an approach to reduce computational overhead in haptic rendering of physically based models. Haptic rendering refers to the notion of adding physical properties and behavior, specifically a sense of touch or force feedback, to models of objects. In this way, a user through a haptic feedback device can feel interaction forces while visually observing the objects. Physically based modeling is particularly important when representing deformable objects. In this paper, an approach based on a mass-spring damper system is used in modeling deformable objects. Deformation due to interaction forces is obtained by solving a set of differential equations, a process that is in general computationally demanding. To reduce this demand, the notion of level-of-detail in haptic rendering is introduced. Here the interplay between the graphical mesh and the haptic mesh as a function of various levels of subdivision is studied. The approach we describe is to adjust model parameters such that the user feels the same reaction force for a given deformation, regardless of the level of local subdivision.A preliminary user study with simple objects suggests there can be a local subdivision threshold such that the user cannot distinguish between global subdivision and the local subdivision introduced by the level-of-detail algorithm. This conclusion is beneficial for haptic rendering of deformable objects. Similar conclusions were obtained for haptic rendering of rigid objects. These results can be used as a guideline for other approaches to modeling deformable objects, such as finite element representations.
