The aim of this work is to identify the depth cues that provide intuitive depth-ordering when used to visualize abstract data. In particular we focus on the depth cues that are effective on a high-dynamic-range (HDR) display: contrast and brightness. In an experiment participants were shown a visualization of the volume layers at different depths with a single isolated monocular cue as the only indication of depth. The observers were asked to identify which slice of the volume appears to be closer. The results show that brightness, contrast and relative size are the most effective monocular depth cues for providing an intuitive depth ordering.
