A new experiment is presented that demonstrates the usefulness of an image space modulation technique called subtle gaze direction (SGD) for guiding the user in a simple searching task. SGD uses image space modulations in the luminance channel to guide a viewer's gaze about a scene without interrupting their visual experience. The goal of SGD is to direct a viewer's gaze to certain regions of a scene without introducing noticeable changes in the image. Using a simple searching task, we compared performance using no modulation, using subtle modulation, and using obvious modulation. Results from the experiments show improved performance when using subtle gaze direction, without affecting the user's perception of the image. We then extend the experiment to evaluate performance with the presence of distractors. The distractors took the form of extra modulations, which do not correspond to a target in the image. Experimentation shows, that, even in the presence of distractors, more accurate results are returned on a simple search task using SGD, as compared to results returned when no modulation at all is used. Results establish the potential of the method for a wide range of applications including gaming, perceptually based rendering, navigation in virtual environments, and medical search tasks.
