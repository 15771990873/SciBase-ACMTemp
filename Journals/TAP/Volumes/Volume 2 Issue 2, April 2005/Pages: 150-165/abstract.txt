A novel two-degree-of-freedom tactile display reproduces the sensations of sliding contact and incipient slip through the rotation of a ball positioned under the user's fingertip. A pair of motor-driven wheels actuates the ball via contact friction. Mechanical performance requirements are used to define the dimensions and construction method of the device. Kinematic analysis shows that the drive wheel angles and their contact locations with the ball must be carefully selected in order to accurately control the axis of rotation and speed of the ball. However, psychophysical experiments indicate that some kinematic error is tolerable; errors of up to 20Â° in slip angle and 30&percnt; of a nominal velocity may be applied without detection from an average user. The lightweight, modular tactile display was attached to a multi-degree-of-freedom kinesthetic interface and used to display virtual environments with slip. Experimental results demonstrate that users complete a virtual paper manipulation task with lower applied forces using combined slip and force feedback in comparison with conventional force feedback alone.
