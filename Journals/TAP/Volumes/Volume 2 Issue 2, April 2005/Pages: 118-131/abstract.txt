Based on existing knowledge on human tactile movement perception, we constructed a prototype of a novel tactile multipin display that controls lateral pin displacement and, thus produces shear force. Two experiments focus on the question of whether the prototype display generates tactile stimulation that is appropriate for the sensitivity of human tactile perception. In particular, Experiment I studied human resolution for distinguishing between different directions of pin displacement and Experiment II explored the perceptual integration of information resulting from the displacement of multiple pins. Both experiments demonstrated that humans can discriminate between directions of the displacements, and also that the technically realized resolution of the display exceeds the perceptual resolution (>14Â°). Experiment II demonstrated that the human brain does not process stimulation from the different pins of the display independent of one another at least concerning direction. The acquired psychophysical knowledge based on this new technology will in return be used to improve the design of the display.
