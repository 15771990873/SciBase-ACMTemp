This article presents the comparison analysis and results of an experiment designed with two presentation modes: real environments and stereoscopic images. The aim of this article is of a methodological nature, with a main objective of analyzing the usability of stereoscopic image presentation as a research tool to evaluate the daylight impact on the perceived architectural quality of small rooms. Twenty-six participants evaluated 12 different stimuli, divided in equal parts between real rooms and stereoscopic images. The stimuli were two similar rooms of different achromatic-colored surfaces (white and black) with three different daylight openings in each room. The participants assessed nine architectural quality attributes on a semantic differential scale. A pragmatic statistical approach (Bland-Altman Approach) for assessing agreement between two methods was used. Results suggest that stereoscopic image presentation is an accurate method to be used when evaluating all nine attributes in the white room and nearly all attributes in the black room.
