EvoFIT, a computerized facial composite system is being developed as an alternative to current systems. EvoFIT faces are initially presented to a witness with random characteristics, but through a process of selection and breeding, a composite is "evolved." Comparing composites constructed with E-FIT, a current system, a naming rate of 10&percnt; was found for EvoFIT and 17&percnt; for E-FIT. Analysis revealed that target age was limiting factor for EvoFIT and a second study with age-appropriate targets visible during composite construction produced a naming rate similar to E-FIT. Two more-realistic studies were conducted that involved young target faces and two current systems (E-FIT and PROfit). Composites from both of these experiments were poorly named but a significant benefit emerged for EvoFIT.
