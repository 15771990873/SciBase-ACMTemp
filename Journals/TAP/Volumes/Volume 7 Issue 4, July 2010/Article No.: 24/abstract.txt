Although there has recently been a large increase in commercial 3D applications, relatively little is known about the quantitative perceptual improvement from binocular disparity. In this study we developed a method to measure the perceived relative depth structure of natural scenes. Observers were instructed to adjust the direction of a virtual pointer from one object to another. The pointing data was used to reconstruct the relative logarithmic depths of the objects in pictorial space. The results showed that the relative depth structure is more similar between observers for stereo images than for mono images in two out of three scenes. A similar result was found for the depth range: for the same two scenes the stereo images were perceived as having more depth than the monocular images. In addition, our method allowed us to determine the subjective center of projection. We found that the pointing settings fitted the reconstructed depth best for substantially wider fields of view than the veridical center of projection for both mono and stereo images. The results indicate that the improvement from binocular disparity depends on the scene content: scenes with sufficient monocular information may not profit much from binocular disparity.
