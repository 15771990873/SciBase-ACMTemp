For representing complex data through auditory display, the ecological approach to sound perception, if combined with the most advanced techniques for physical modeling, seems to form a good strategy to translate information into sound by composition of auditory scenes and to create an object-based auditory information space.We examine the auditory perception of one feature of simulated 3D resonators: the size. In prior publications, we assessed the ability of humans to distinguish the shapes of (spherical and cubic) resonators, and we investigated pitch perception and its relationship to the volume of the enclosures. In this paper, we focus on the latter topic, introducing our most recent experiments and results. We validate previous results in a more controlled environment and, in particular, we investigate whether the specific procedure used in the auditory display may affect the users' performance.The results of the experiment show that even the perception of a basic object property such as size can be affected by the listening procedure and can be decoupled from object shape only in controlled conditions.
