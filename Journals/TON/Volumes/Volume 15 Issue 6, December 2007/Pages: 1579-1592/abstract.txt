Two recovery techniques suited for the Next Generation Internet are studied: traditional protection rings (BLSRs) and a novel, preconfigured protection cycles (p-cycles) technique. Theoretical formulas describing the reliability function as well as Mean Time to Failure are derived. On the basis of our analysis, we show thatp-cycles should not be used in wide-area networks since their reliability performance is outside the desired bounds.
