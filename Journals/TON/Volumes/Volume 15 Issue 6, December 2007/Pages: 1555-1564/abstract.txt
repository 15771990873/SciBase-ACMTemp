A bifurcated approach is typically adopted to the regular virtual topology design problem. By exploiting key metrics that affect optimization solutions, it is shown that easily computed parameters, pertaining to the spread in inter-nodal distances and the spread in inter-nodal traffic, are descriptive and appropriate means to characterize problem inputs, the physical topology and the traffic matrix. The juxtaposition between these parameters and the optimization results is explored, culminating in the development of a novel holistic framework for regular virtual topology design. This framework offers the possibility of simplifying regular virtual topology design by presenting the different traditional design approaches as being nuances of a single overarching problem and suggesting criteria for choosing the most expedient design approach.
