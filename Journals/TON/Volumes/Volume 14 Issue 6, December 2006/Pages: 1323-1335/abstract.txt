Most existing reliable multicast congestion control (RMCC) mechanisms try to emulate TCP congestion control behaviors for achieving TCP-compatibility. However, different loss recovery mechanisms employed in reliable multicast protocols, especially NAK-based retransmission and local loss recovery mechanisms, may lead to different behaviors and performance of congestion control. As a result, reliable multicast flows might be identified and treated as non-TCP-friendly by routers in the network. It is essential to understand those influences and take them into account in the development and deployment of reliable multicast services. In this paper, we study the influences comprehensively through analysis, modelling and simulations. We demonstrate that NAK-based retransmission and/or local loss recovery mechanisms are much more robust and efficient in recovering from single or multiple packet losses within a single round-trip time (RTT). For a better understanding on the impact of loss recovery on RMCC, we derive expressions for steady-state throughput of NAK-based RMCC schemes, which clearly brings out the throughput advantages of NAK-based RMCC over TCP Reno. We also show that timeout effects have little impact on shaping the performance of NAK-based RMCC schemes except for extremely high loss rates (>0.2). Finally, we use simulations to validate our findings and show that local loss recovery may further increase the throughput and deteriorate the fairness properties of NAK-based RMCC schemes. These findings and insights could provide useful recommendations for the design, testing and deployment of reliable multicast protocols and services.
