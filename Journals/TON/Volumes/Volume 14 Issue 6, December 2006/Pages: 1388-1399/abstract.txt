Shared path protection has been demonstrated to be a very efficient survivability scheme for optical networking. In this scheme, multiple backup paths can share a given optical channel if their corresponding primary routes are not expected to fail simultaneously. The focus in this area has been the optimization of the total channels (i.e., bandwidth) provisioned in the network through the intelligent routing of primary and backup routes. In this work, we extend the current path protection sharing scheme and introduce the Generalized Sharing Concept. In this concept, we allow for additional sharing of important node devices. These node devices (e.g., optical-electronic-optical regenerators (OEOs), pure all-optical converters, etc.) constitute the dominant cost factor in an optical backbone network and the reduction of their number is of paramount importance. For demonstration purposes, we extend the concept of 1:Nshared path protection to allow for the sharing of electronic regenerators needed for coping with optical transmission impairments. Both design and control plane issues are discussed through numerical examples. Considerable cost reductions in electronic budget are demonstrated.
