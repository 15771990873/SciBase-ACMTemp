OBEX (Object Exchange Protocol) is a session protocol designed to exchange all kind of objects between portable devices using different ad hoc wireless links including IrDA and Bluetooth. This paper develops a mathematical model for OBEX over the IrDA protocol stack by considering multiple applications and presence of bit errors. The model is also verified by simulation results. We derive throughput equations and carry out an optimization study focusing on four major parameters: OBEX packet size, TinyTP (IrDA transport layer) buffer size, IrLAP (IrDA link layer) frame and window size. Equations are derived for the optimum IrLAP windowand frame sizes. Numerical results show significant improvement on OBEX performance using the optimized parameters. The major contribution of this work is the modelling of OBEX including the low layer protocols and optimization of the overall throughput by appropriate parameter selection.
