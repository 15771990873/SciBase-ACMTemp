This paper proposes a novel scheme for the design of topology-transparent scheduling (TTS) in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), based on the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT). TTS can provide each node with guaranteed success in each schedule without any detailed topology information and yields a guaranteed upper bound on the transmission delay of each packet at every node in a MANET. In general, TTS requires two global constraints on the number of nodes in the MANET and the maximum nodal degree of the graph representing connectivity of the MANET. Due to the inherent mobility of MANETs, the maximum nodal degree, however, cannot be available or easily estimated. To eliminate the requirement for the maximum nodal degree, this paper proposes TTS via the CRT. By the redundancy property of the Chinese remainder representation, the proposed CRT-based scheme not only preserves the advantages of providing guaranteed success in each schedule with only the global constraint on the number of nodes in the MANET, but also offers flexibility in constructing TTS. To have a better transmission delay bound for a node with lower interference, this paper also introduces two threaded counterparts of the proposed CRT-based scheme. This paper provides performance analyses for the proposed CRT-based scheme and its threaded counterparts. Numerical results demonstrate that TTS via the CRT can outperform existing schemes, especially in scenarios with harsh interference, and is a versatile approach for the design of TTS.
