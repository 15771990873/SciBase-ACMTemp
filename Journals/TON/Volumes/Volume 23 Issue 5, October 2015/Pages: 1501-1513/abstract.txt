Networks-on-chip (NoCs) are emerging as the way to interconnect the processing cores and the memory within a chip multiprocessor. As recent years have seen a significant increase in the number of cores per chip, it is crucial to guarantee the scalability of NoCs in order to avoid communication to become the next performance bottleneck in multicore processors. Among other alternatives, the concept of wireless network-on-chip (WNoC) has been proposed, wherein on-chip antennas would provide native broadcast capabilities leading to enhanced network performance. Since energy consumption and chip area are the two primary constraints, this work is aimed to explore the area and energy implications of scaling a WNoC in terms of: 1) the number of cores within the chip, and 2) the capacity of each link in the network. To this end, an integral design space exploration is performed, covering implementation aspects (area and energy), communication aspects (link capacity), and network-level considerations (number of cores and network architecture). The study is entirely based upon analytical models, which will allow to benchmark the WNoC scalability against a baseline NoC. Eventually, this investigation will provide qualitative and quantitative guidelines for the design of future transceivers for wireless on-chip communication.
