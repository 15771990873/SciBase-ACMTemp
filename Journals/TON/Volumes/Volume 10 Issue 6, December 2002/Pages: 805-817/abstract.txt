By extending the system theory under the (min, +) algebra to the time-varying setting, we solve the problem of constrained traffic regulation and develop a calculus for dynamic service guarantees. For a constrained traffic-regulation problem with maximum tolerable delaydand maximum buffer sizeq,the optimal regulator that generates the output traffic conforming to a subadditive envelopefand minimizes the number of discarded packets is a concatenation of theg-clipper withg(t) = min[f(t+d),f(t) +q] and the maximalf-regulator. Theg-clipper is abufferlessdevice, which optimally drops packets as necessary in order that its output be conformant to an envelopeg.The maximalf-regulator is abuffereddevice that delays packets as necessary in order that its output be conformant to an envelopef. The maximalf-regulator is a linear time-invariant filter with impulse responsef,under the (min, +) algebra.To provide dynamic service guarantees in a network, we develop the concept of a dynamic server as a basic network element. Dynamic servers can be joined by concatenation, "filter bank summation," and feedback to form a composite dynamic server. We also show that dynamic service guarantees for multiple input streams sharing a work-conserving link can be achieved by a dynamic service curve earliest deadline scheduling algorithm, if an appropriate admission control is enforced.
