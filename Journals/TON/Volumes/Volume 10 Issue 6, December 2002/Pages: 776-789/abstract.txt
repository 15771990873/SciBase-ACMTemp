In multihop networks, packet schedulers at downstream nodes have an opportunity to make up for excessive latencies due to congestion at upstream nodes. Similarly, when packets incurlowdelays at upstream nodes, downstream nodes canreducepriority and schedule other packets first. The goal of this paper is to define a framework for design and analysis of coordinated multihop scheduling (CMS) which exploit such internode coordination. We first provide a general CMS definition which enables us to classify a number of schedulers from the literature, including G-EDF, FIFO+, CEDF, and work-conserving CJVC as examples of CMS schedulers. We then develop a distributed theory of traffic envelopes which enables us to derive end-to-end statistical admission control conditions for CMS schedulers. We show that CMS schedulers are able to limit traffic distortion to within a narrow range resulting in improved end-to-end performance and more efficient resource utilization. Consequently, our technique exploits statistical resource sharing among flows, classes, and nodes, and our results provide the first statistical multinode multiclass admission control algorithm for networks of work conserving servers.
