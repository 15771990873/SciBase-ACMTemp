Most of the QoS routing schemes proposed so far require periodic exchange of QoS state information among routers, imposing both communication overhead on the network and processing overhead on core routers. Furthermore, stale QoS state information causes the performance of these QoS routing schemes to degrade drastically. In order to circumvent these problems, we focus onlocalizedQoS routing schemes where the edge routers make routing decisions using only local information and thus reducing the overhead at core routers. We first describevirtual capacity based routing(vcr), a theoretical scheme based on the notion ofvirtual capacityof a route. We then proposeproportional sticky routing,an easily realizable approximation of vcr and analyze its performance. We demonstrate through extensive simulations that adaptive proportional routing is indeed a viable alternative to the global QoS routing approach.
