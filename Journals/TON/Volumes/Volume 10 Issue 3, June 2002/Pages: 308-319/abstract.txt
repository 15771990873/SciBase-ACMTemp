A computer network is said to provide hop integrity iff when any routerpin the network receives a messagemsupposedly from an adjacent routerq, thenpcan check thatmwas indeed sent byq, was not modified after it was sent, and was not a replay of an old message sent fromqtop. In this paper, we describe three protocols that can be added to the routers in a computer network so that the network can provide hop integrity, and thus overcome most denial-of-service attacks. These three protocols are a secret exchange protocol, a weak integrity protocol, and a strong integrity protocol. All three protocols are stateless, require small overhead, and do not constrain the network protocol in the routers in any way.
