A new rearrangeable nonblocking photonic multi-log2NnetworkDM(N) is introduced. It is shown thatDM(N) network possesses many good properties simultaneously. These good properties include all those of existing rearrangeable nonblocking photonic multi-log2Nnetworks and new ones such asO(logN)-time fast parallel self-routing, nonblocking multiple-multicast, and cost-effective crosstalk-free wavelength dilation, which existing rearrangeable nonblocking multi-log2Nnetworks do not have. The advantages ofDM(N) over existing multi-log2Nnetworks, especially Log2(N, 0, 2⌊log2N/2⌋), are achieved by employing a two-level load balancing scheme--a combination of static load balancing and dynamic load balancing.DM(N) and Log2(N, 0, 2⌊log2N/2⌋) are about the same in structure. The additional cost is for the intraplane routing preprocessing circuits. Considering the extended capabilities ofDM(N) and current mature and cheap electronic technology, this extra cost is well justified.
