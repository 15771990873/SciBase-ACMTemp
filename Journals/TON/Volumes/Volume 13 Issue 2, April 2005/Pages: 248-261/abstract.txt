In this paper we focus on the single-facility capacitated survivable network design problem. We optimize simultaneously the network topology and the link dimensioning in order to route all traffic commodities according to survivability requirements. The latter are actually expressed in terms of the spare capacity required to address link failures in the context of different rerouting strategies. We present a mixed-integer linear programming model solved by combining several approaches. To tackle the high dimensionality and to separate the continuous and integer variables, we use Benders' decomposition and a cutting-plane approach. Going beyond the proposed method itself, we examine and compare two well-known restoration techniques: local and end-to-end reroutings. Numerous computational results for realistic network instances provide a comparison of these rerouting mechanisms in terms of installed capacities, network density as well as overall costs and CPU time.
