This paper presents new constructions of multistage wave-mixing networks with arbitraryb × bspace-switching elements, whereb≥ 2. In these networks, for a size ofFfiber links andWwavelengths per link, converter requirements areO(F logbW)orO(FW/b)for rearrangeable nodes, andO(FlogbW logb(FW))orO(FW logb(FW)/b)for different types of strictly nonblocking nodes inspired from the Cantor topology. In all cases, the worst case number of cascaded conversion isO(logbW). Whenb=W ≤F, the required number of converters, and the worst case number of cascaded conversions are respectivelyO(F)andO(1), and are both optimal up to a constant. The new networks generalize and improve upon previous wave-mixing networks based on 2 × 2 space switches.
