We study the multi-constrained quality-ofservice (QoS) routing problem where one seeks to find a path from a source to a destination in the presence ofK≥ 2 additive end-to-end QoS constraints. This problem is NP-hard and is commonly modeled using a graph withnvertices andmedges withKadditive QoS parameters associated with each edge. For the case ofK= 2, the problem has been well studied, with several provably good polynomial time-approximation algorithms reported in the literature, which enforce one constraint while approximating the other. We first focus on an optimization version of the problem where we enforce the first constraint and approximate the otherK- 1 constraints. We present anO(mnlog logn+mn/ε) time (1 + ε) (K- 1) -approximation algorithm and anO(mnlog logn+m(n/ε)K-1) time (1 + ε) -approximation algorithm, for any ε > 0. WhenKis reduced to 2, both algorithms produce an (1 + ε) -approximation with a time complexity better than that of the best-known algorithm designed for this special case. We then study the decision version of the problem and present anO(m(n/ε)K-1) time algorithm which either finds a feasible solution or confirms that there does not exist a source-destination path whose first weight is bounded by the first constraint and whose every other weight is bounded by (1 - ε) times the corresponding constraint. If there exists anH-hop source-destination path whose first weight is bounded by the first constraint and whose every other weight is bounded by (1 - ε) times the corresponding constraint, our algorithm finds a feasible path inO(m(H/ε)K-1time. This algorithm improves previous best-known algorithms withO((m+nlogn)n/ε) time forK= 2 andO(mn(n/ε)K-1) time forK≥ 2.
