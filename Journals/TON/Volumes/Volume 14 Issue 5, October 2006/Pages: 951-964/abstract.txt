Concurrent multipath transfer (CMT) uses the Stream Control Transmission Protocol's (SCTP) multihoming feature to distribute data across multiple end-to-end paths in a multihomed SCTP association. We identify three negative side-effects of reordering introduced by CMT that must be managed before efficient parallel transfer can be achieved: (1) unnecessary fast retransmissions by a sender; (2) overly conservative congestion window (cwnd) growth at a sender; and (3) increased ack traffic due to fewer delayed acks by a receiver. We propose three algorithms which augment and/or modify current SCTP to counter these side-effects. Presented with several choices as to where a sender should direct retransmissions of lost data, we propose five retransmission policies for CMT. We demonstrate spurious retransmissions in CMT with all five policies and propose changes to CMT to allow the different policies. CMT is evaluated against AppStripe, which is an idealized application that stripes data over multiple paths using multiple SCTP associations. The different CMT retransmission policies are then evaluated with varied constrained receive buffer sizes. In this foundation work, we operate under the strong assumption that the bottleneck queues on the end-to-end paths used in CMT are independent.
