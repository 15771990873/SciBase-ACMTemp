We study a priority service where users are free to choose the priority of their traffic, but are charged accordingly by the network. We assume that each user chooses priorities to maximize its own net benefit, and model the resulting interaction among users as a noncooperative game. We show that there exists an unique equilibrium for this game and that in equilibrium the bandwidth allocation is weighted max-min fair.
