In this paper, we explore end-to-end loss differentiation algorithms (LDAs) for use with congestion-sensitive video transport protocols for networks with either backbone or last-hop wireless links. As our basic video transport protocol, we use UDP in conjunction with a congestion control mechanism extended with an LDA. For congestion control, we use the TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC) algorithm. We extend TFRC to use an LDA when a connection uses at least one wireless link in the path between the sender and receiver. We then evaluate various LDAs under different wireless network topologies, competing traffic, and fairness scenarios to determine their effectiveness. In addition to evaluating LDAs derived from previous work, we also propose and evaluate a new LDA, ZigZag, and a hybrid LDA, ZBS, that selects among base LDAs depending upon observed network conditions.We evaluate these LDAs via simulation, and find that no single base algorithm performs well across all topologies and competition. However, the hybrid algorithm performs well across topologies and competition, and in some cases exceeds the performance of the best base LDA for a given scenario. All of the LDAs are reasonably fair when competing with TCP, and their fairness among flows using the same LDA depends on the network topology. In general, ZigZag and the hybrid algorithm are the fairest among all LDAs.
