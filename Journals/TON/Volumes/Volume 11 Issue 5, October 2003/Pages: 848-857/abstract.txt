Recent research has generated many interesting results on scheduling input-queued switches. However, most of this work focuses on a single switch in isolation. In this paper, we study the problem of scheduling anetworkof input-queued switches. We consider the Longest-Queue-First and Longest-Port-First scheduling policies that are stable for a single switch, and show that they can be unstable even for a fixed traffic pattern in a simple network of eight input-queued switches. Moreover, this result holds regardless of how the traffic sharing the same port-pair is scheduled at each switch. On the positive side, we present a policy, Longest-in-Network, that is stable in networks of input-queued switches. This result holds even if the traffic pattern is allowed to change over time.
