We study cross-layer design in random-access-based fixed wireless multihop networks under a physical interference model. Due to the complexity of the problem, we consider a simple slotted ALOHA medium access control (MAC) protocol for link-layer operation. We formulate a joint routing, access probability, and rate allocation optimization problem to determine the optimal max-min throughput of the flows and the optimal configuration of the routing, access probability, and transmission rate parameters in a slotted ALOHA system. We then also adapt this problem to include an XOR-like network coding without opportunistic listening. Both problems are complex nonlinear and nonconvex. We provide extensive numerical results for both problems for medium-size mesh networks using an iterated optimal search technique. Via numerical and simulation results, we show that: 1) joint design provides a significant throughput gain over a default configuration in slotted-ALOHA-based wireless networks; and 2) the throughput gain obtained by the simple network coding is significant, especially at low transmission power. We also propose simple heuristics to configure slotted-ALOHA-based wireless mesh networks. These heuristics are extensively evaluated via simulation and found to be very efficient.
