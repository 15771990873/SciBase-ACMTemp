In this paper, we propose a new multiple-sink positioning problem in wireless sensor networks to best support real-time applications. We formally define this problem as thek-Sink Placement Problem (k-SPP) and prove that it is APX-complete. We show that an existing approximation algorithm for the well-known -center problem is a constant factor approximation ofk-SPP. Furthermore, we introduce a new greedy algorithm fork-SPP and prove its approximation ratio is very near to the best achievable, 2. Via simulations, we showour algorithm outperforms its competitor on average.
