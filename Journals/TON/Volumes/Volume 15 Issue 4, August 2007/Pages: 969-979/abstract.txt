We study the problem of determining the minimum number of limited-range wavelength converters needed to construct strictly, wide-sense, and rearrangeably nonblocking optical cross-connects for both unicast and multicast traffic patterns. We give the exact formula to compute this number for rearrangeably and wide-sense nonblocking cross-connects under both the unicast and multicast cases. We also give optimal cross-connect constructions with respect to the number of limited-range wavelength converters.
