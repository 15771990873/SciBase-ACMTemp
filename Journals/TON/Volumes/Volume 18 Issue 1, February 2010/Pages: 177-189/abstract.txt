Traffic matrix is essential to traffic engineering (TE) methods. Because it is difficult to monitor traffic matrices directly, several methods for estimating them from link loads have been proposed. However, estimated traffic matrix includes estimation errors which degrade the performance of TE significantly. In this paper, we propose a method that reduces estimation errors while reconfiguring the virtual network topology (VNT) by cooperating with the VNT reconfiguration. In our method, the VNT reconfiguration is divided into multiple stages instead of reconfiguring the suitable VNT at once. By dividing the VNT reconfiguration into multiple stages, our traffic matrix estimation method calibrates and reduces the estimation errors in each stage by using information monitored in prior stages. We also investigate the effectiveness of our proposal using simulations. The results show that our method can improve the accuracy of the traffic matrix estimation and achieve an adequate VNT as is the case with the reconfiguration using the actual traffic matrices.
