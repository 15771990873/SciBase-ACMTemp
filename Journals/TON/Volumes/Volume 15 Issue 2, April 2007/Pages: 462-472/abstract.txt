We use a collection of hash tables to represent a multidimensional packet classification table. These hash tables are derived from a trie-representation of the multidimensional classifier. The height of this trie isO(W), whereWis the sum of the maximum possible length, in bits, of each of the fields of a filter. The leaves at leveliof the trie together with markers for some of the leaves at levelsjsuch thatj>iare stored in a hash tableHi. The placement of markers is such that a binary search of theHi's successfully locates the highest-priority filter that matches any given packet. The number of hash tables equals the trie height,O(W). Hence, a packet may be classified by performingO(logW) hash-table lookups. So the expected lookup-complexity of our data structure for multidimensional packet classification isO(logW). Our proposed scheme affords a memory advantage over theO(logW) 1-D scheme of Waldvogel et al. For multidimensional packet classification, our proposed scheme provides both a time and memory advantage over the extended grid-of-tries scheme of Baboescu et al.
