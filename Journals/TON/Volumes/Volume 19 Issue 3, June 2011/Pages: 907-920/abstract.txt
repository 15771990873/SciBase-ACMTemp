Being reported as the most general monitoring structure for out-of-band failure localization approach, the monitoring trail (m-trail) framework has been witnessed with great efficiency and promises to serve in the future Internet backbone with all-optical mesh wavelength division multiplex (WDM) networks. Motivated by its potential and significance, this paper investigates failure localization in all-optical mesh networks using m-trails. By considering shared risk link groups (SRLGs) with up to all adjacent links of any node in the network, a novel algorithm of m-trail allocation for achieving unambiguous failure localization (UFL) of any single SRLG failure is developed. The proposed algorithm aims to minimize the number of required m-trails and can achieve superb performance with respect to the computation efficiency. We claim that among all the previously reported counterparts, this paper has considered one of the most applicable scenarios to the design of network backbone, and the proposed method can be easily extended to the case of node failure localization. Extensive simulation is conducted to verify the proposed algorithm in comparison to its existing counterparts.
