Link adaptation technologies, such as Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC) and Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO), are used in advanced wireless communication systems to achieve high spectrum efficiency. Communication performance can be improved significantly by adaptive transmissions based on the quality of received signals, i.e., the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). However, for multihop wireless communications, most link scheduling schemes have been developed under simplified interference models that do not account for accumulative interference and cannot fully exploit the recent advances in PHY-layer communication theory. This paper focuses on developing link scheduling schemes that can achieve optimal performance under the SINR model. One key idea is to treat an adaptive wireless link as multiple parallel virtual links with different signal quality, building on which we develop throughput-optimal scheduling schemes using a two-stage queueing structure in conjunction with recently developed carrier-sensing techniques. Furthermore, we introduce a novel three-way handshake to ensure, in a distributed manner, that all transmitting links satisfy their SINR requirements. We evaluate the proposed schemes through rigorous analysis and simulations.
