In this paper, we study several properties of binary-feedback congestion control in rate-based applications. We first derive necessary conditions for generic binary-feedback congestion control to converge to fairness monotonically (which guarantees asymptotic stability of the fairness point) and show that AIMD is theonlyTCP-friendly binomial control with monotonic convergence to fairness. We then study steady-state behavior of binomial controls withncompeting flows on a single bottleneck. Our main result here shows that combined probing for new bandwidth by all flows results in significant overshoot of the available bandwidth and rapid (often super-linear as a function ofn) increase in packet loss. We also show that AIMD has the best scalability and lowest packet-loss increase among all TCP-friendly binomial schemes. We conclude the paper by deriving the conditions necessary to achieve constant packet loss regardless of the number of competing flowsnand examine one new scheme with such constant packet loss calledideally scalable congestion controlin both simulation and streaming experiments.
