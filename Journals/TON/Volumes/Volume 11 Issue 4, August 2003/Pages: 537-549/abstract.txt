The available bandwidth (avail-bw) in a network path is of major importance in congestion control, streaming applications, quality-of-service verification, server selection, and overlay networks. We describe an end-to-end methodology, called self-loading periodic streams (SLoPS), for measuring avail-bw. The basic idea in SLoPS is that the one-way delays of a periodic packet stream show an increasing trend when the stream's rate is higher than the avail-bw. We implemented SLoPS in a tool calledpathload. The accuracy of the tool has been evaluated with both simulations and experiments over real-world Internet paths.Pathloadis nonintrusive, meaning that it does not cause significant increases in the network utilization, delays, or losses. We usedpathloadto evaluate the variability ("dynamics") of the avail-bw in internet paths. The avail-bw becomes significantly more variable in heavily utilized paths, as well as in paths with limited capacity (probably due to a lower degree of statistical multiplexing). We finally examine the relation between avail-bw and TCP throughput. A persistent TCP connection can be used to roughly measure the avail-bw in a path, but TCP saturates the path and increases significantly the path delays and jitter.
