We study TCP performance over the wireless links deploying a wireless rate-control technique, whose link characteristics are identified by variable link rate and bursty transmission error. We present a TCP enhancement scheme, called rate-adaptive snoop (RA-Snoop). RA-Snoop caches TCP packets selectively based on the wireless channel condition and the cached packets are retransmitted locally over the wireless link in case corruption loss is detected. In addition, for effective adaptation to variable bandwidth, RA-Snoop calculates the window feedback based on the bandwidth-delay product estimation and the queue level, then conveys this feedback information on the receiver's advertised window field in the acknowledgements returning to TCP sources. We compare the performance of RA-Snoop with that of existing schemes in the aspect of goodput and fairness. Results from simulations reveal that RA-Snoop achieves significant improvements over the existing schemes for various traffic scenarios.
