A unified algorithmic framework for time-optimal transmission scheduling is obtained for satellite-switched time-division multiple access systems withMuplink andNdownlink beams. System capability may vary from the basic configuration of one carrier per beam to complex configurations of variable number of carriers for each beam and variable transmission rate for each beam. The computational complexity for time-optimal transmission scheduling remains strongly polynomial atO(M2N2) and the number of switching configurations is at mostM N+ 1 for all system configurations considered.
