We consider the problem of establishingdependable connectionsin WDM networks with dynamic traffic demands. We call a connection with fault-tolerant requirements as a dependable connection (D-connection). We consider thesingle-link failure modelin our study and recommend the use of a proactive approach, wherein a D-connection is identified with the establishment of the primary lightpath and a backup lightpath at the time of honoring the connection request. We develop algorithms to select routes and wavelengths to establish D-connections with improved blocking performance. The algorithms use thebackup multiplexingtechnique to efficiently utilize the wavelength channels. To further improve channel utilization, we propose a new multiplexing technique calledprimary-backup multiplexing. Here, a connection may not have its backup lightpath readily available throughout its existence. We develop algorithms based on this technique to route D-connections with a specifiedrestoration guarantee. We present an efficient and computationally simple heuristic to estimate the average number of connections per link that do not have backup lightpaths readily available upon a link failure. We conduct extensive simulation experiments on different networks to study the performance of the proposed algorithms.
