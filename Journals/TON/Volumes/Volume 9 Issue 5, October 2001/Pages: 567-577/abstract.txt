We propose a new media-access and connection-establishment protocol for anad-hocquasi-synchronous packet radio network (QSPNET). In the QSPNET, the bandwidth is partitioned into a data channel, used to transmit packets, and a control channel, used to make reservations. Transmitted wave-forms in the QSPNET are made quasi-synchronous by using a local GPS clock. The QSPNET uses a novel linear decorrelator receiver for multiuser detection, which permits the reception of quasi-synchronous code division multiple access (QS-CDMA) waveforms. We initially describe the QSPNET and its connection and flow control protocols, giving the rules of transmission and reception followed by all mobiles. We also provide performance results for the case where connection requests are generated at each node of the QSPNET according to a random process over an infinite time horizon. In particular, we obtain results on the achievable throughput and the average delay as a function of the transmission radius, the quasi-synchronous uncertainty interval, the duration of the connections, and the buffer size per node.
