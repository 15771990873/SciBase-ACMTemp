According to several studies, the power consumption of the Internet accounts for up to 10% of theworldwide energy consumption and is constantly increasing. The global consciousness on this problem has also grown, and several initiatives are being put into place to reduce the power consumption of the ICT sector in general. In this paper, we face the problem of minimizing power consumption for Internet service provider (ISP) networks. In particular, we propose and assess strategies to concentrate network traffic on a minimal subset of network resources. Given a telecommunication infrastructure, our aim is to turn off network nodes and links while still guaranteeing full connectivity and maximum link utilization constraints. We first derive a simple and complete formulation, which results into an NP-hard problem that can be solved only for trivial cases. We then derive more complex formulations that can scale up to middle-sized networks. Finally, we provide efficient heuristics that can be used for large networks. We test the effectiveness of our algorithms on both real and synthetic topologies, considering the daily fluctuations of Internet traffic and different classes of users. Results show that the power savings can be significant, e.g., larger than 35%.
