We study the problem of throughput maximization in multihop wireless networks with end-to-end delay constraints for each session. This problem has received much attention starting with the work of Grossglauser and Tse (2002), and it has been shown that there is a significant tradeoff between the end-to-end delays and the total achievable rate. We develop algorithms to compute such tradeoffs with provable performance guarantees for arbitrary instances, with general interference models. Given a target delay-bound Δ(c) for each sessionc, our algorithm gives a stable flow vector with a total throughput within a factor ofO(log Δm/log Δm) of the maximum, so that the persession (end-to-end) delay isO(((log Δm/log log Δm)Δ(c))2), where Δm= maxc{Δ(c)}; note that these bounds depend only on the delays, and not on the network size, and this is the first such result, to our knowledge.
