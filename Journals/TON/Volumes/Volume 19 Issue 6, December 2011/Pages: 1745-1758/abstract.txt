We extend the analysis of the scaling laws of wireless ad hoc networks to the case of correlated nodes movements, which are commonly found in real mobility processes. We consider a simple version of the Reference Point Group Mobility model, in which nodes belonging to the same group are constrained to lie in a disc area, whose center moves uniformly across the network according to the i.i.d. model. We assume fast mobility conditions and take as a primary goal the maximization of per-node throughput. We discover that correlated node movements have a huge impact on asymptotic throughput and delay and can sometimes lead to better performance than the one achievable under independent nodes movements.
