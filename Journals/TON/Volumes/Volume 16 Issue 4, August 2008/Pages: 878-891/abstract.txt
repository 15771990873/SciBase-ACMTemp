In this paper, we present an analytic model for evaluating the queueing delays and channel access times at nodes in wireless networks using the IEEE 802.11 Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) as the MAC protocol. The model can account for arbitrary arrival patterns, packet size distributions and number of nodes. Our model gives closed form expressions for obtaining the delay and queue length characteristics and models each node as a discrete timeG/G/1fs queue. The service time distribution for the queues is derived by accounting for a number of factors including the channel access delay due to the shared medium, impact of packet collisions, the resulting backoffs as well as the packet size distribution. The model is also extended for ongoing proposals under consideration for 802.11e wherein a number of packets may be transmitted in a burst once the channel is accessed. Our analytical results are verified through extensive simulations. The results of our model can also be used for providing probabilistic quality of service guarantees and determining the number of nodes that can be accommodated while satisfying a given delay constraint.
