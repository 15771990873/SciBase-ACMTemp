We consider a multi-hop wireless network shared by many users. For an interference model that constrains a node to either transmit to or receive from only one other node at a time, and not to do both, we propose an architecture for fair resource allocation that consists of a distributed scheduling algorithm operating in conjunction with an asynchronous congestion control algorithm. We show that the proposed joint congestion control and scheduling algorithm supports at least one-third of the throughput supportable by any other algorithm, including centralized algorithms.
