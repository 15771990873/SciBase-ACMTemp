In order to stem the increasing packet loss rates caused by an exponential increase in network traffic, theietfhas been considering the deployment of active queue management techniques such asRed[14]. While active queue management can potentially reduce packet loss rates in the Internet, we show that current techniques are ineffective in preventing high loss rates. The inherent problem with these queue management algorithms is that they use queue lengths as the indicator of the severity of congestion. In light of this observation, a fundamentally different active queue management algorithm, calledBlue, is proposed, implemented, and evaluated.Blueuses packet loss and link idle events to manage congestion. Using both simulation and controlled experiments,Blueis shown to perform significantly better thanRed, both in terms of packet loss rates and buffer size requirements in the network. As an extension toBlue, a novel technique based on Bloom filters [2] is described for enforcing fairness among a large number of flows. In particular, we propose and evaluate Stochastic FairBlue(SFB), a queue management algorithm which can identify and rate-limit nonresponsive flows using a very small amount of state information.
