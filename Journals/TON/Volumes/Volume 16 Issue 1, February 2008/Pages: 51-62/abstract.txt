The one type of routing in ad hoc and sensor networks that currently appears to be most amenable to algorithmic analysis is geographic routing. This paper contains an introduction to the problem field of geographic routing, presents a specific routing algorithm based on a synthesis of the greedy forwarding and face routing approaches, and provides an algorithmic analysis of the presented algorithm from both a worst-case and an average-case perspective.
