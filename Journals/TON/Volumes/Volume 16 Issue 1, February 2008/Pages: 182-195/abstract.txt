Low latency is a critical requirement in some switching applications, specifically in parallel computer interconnection networks. The minimum latency in switches with centralized scheduling comprises two components, namely, the control-path latency and the data-path latency, which in a practical high-capacity, distributed switch implementation can be far greater than the cell duration. We introduce a speculative transmission scheme to significantly reduce the average control-path latency by allowing cells to proceed without waiting for a grant, under certain conditions. It operates in conjunction with any centralized matching algorithm to achieve a high maximum utilization and incorporates a reliable delivery mechanism to deal with failed speculations. An analytical model is presented to investigate the efficiency of the speculative transmission scheme employed in a non-blockingNÃ—NRinput-queued crossbar switch withRreceivers per output. Using this model, performance measures such as the mean delay and the rate of successful speculative transmissions are derived. The results demonstrate that the control-path latency can be almost entirely eliminated for loads up to 50%. Our simulations confirm the analytical results.
