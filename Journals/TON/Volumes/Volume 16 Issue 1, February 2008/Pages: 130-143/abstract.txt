This paper analyzes the asymptotic behavior of packet-train probing over a multi-hop network pathPcarrying arbitrarily routed bursty cross-traffic flows. We examine the statistical mean of the packet-train output dispersions and its relationship to the input dispersion. We call this relationship the response curve of pathP. We show that the real response curveZis tightly lower-bounded by its multi-hop fluid counterpartF, obtained when every cross-traffic flow onPis hypothetically replaced with a constant-rate fluid flow of the same average intensity and routing pattern. The real curveZasymptotically approaches its fluid counterpartFas probing packet size or packet train length increases. Most existing measurement techniques are based upon the single-hop fluid curveSassociated with the bottleneck link inP. We note that the curveScoincides withFin a certain large-dispersion input range, but falls belowFin the remaining small-dispersion input ranges. As an implication of these findings, we show that bursty cross-traffic in multi-hop paths causes negative bias (asymptotic underestimation) to most existing techniques. This bias can be mitigated by reducing the deviation ofZfromSusing large packet size or long packet-trains. However, the bias is not completely removable for the techniques that use the portion ofSthat falls belowF.
