When multimedia streams arrive at the receiver, their temporal relationships may be distorted due to jitter. Assuming the media stream is packetized, the jitter is then the packet's arrival time deviation from its expected arrival time. There are various ways to reduce jitter, which include synchronization at the application layer, or synchronization at theasynchronous transfer mode(ATM)adaptation layer(AAL). The new source rate recovery scheme calledjitter time-stamp(JTS) provides synchronization at theATM adaptation layer 2(AAL2) which is used to carry variable bit-rate traffic such as compressed voice and video. JTS is implemented, and experiments have shown that it is able to recover the source rate.
