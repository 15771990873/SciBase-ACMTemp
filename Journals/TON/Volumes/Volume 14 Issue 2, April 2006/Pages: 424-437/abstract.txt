We study network protocol system monitoring for fault detection using a formal technique of passive testing that is a process of detecting system faults by passively observing its input/output behaviors without interrupting its normal operations. After describing a formal model of event-driven extended finite state machines, we present two algorithms for passive testing of protocol system control and data portions. Experimental results on OSPF and TCP are reported.
