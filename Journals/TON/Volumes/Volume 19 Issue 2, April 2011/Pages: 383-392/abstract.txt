A main design issue in a wireless data broadcasting system is to choose between push-based and pull-based logic: The former is used as a low-cost solution, while the latter is preferred when performance is of utmost importance. Therefore, the most significant advantage of a push system is the minimal cost. This fact implies that hardware limitations do exist in the case of push systems. As a consequence, every related proposed algorithm should primarily be cost-effective. This attribute, however, has been overlooked in related research. In this paper, popular broadcast scheduling approaches are tested from an implementation cost aspect, and the results render them only conditionally realizable. Moreover, a new, cost-effective, adaptivity oriented schedule constructor is proposed as a realistic, minimal-cost solution.
