The bufferless fluid flow model (bffm) is often used in the literature for loss performance analysis. In this paper, we propose an efficient and effective means of investigating cell loss using the bffm. We define the cell loss rate function (clrf) and use it to characterize the loss performance of traffic sources in the bffm. Stochastic ordering theory is used to study the clrf. The introduction of the stochastic ordering theory not only simplifies the theoretical analysis but also makes it possible to extend the scope of applications and theoretical analysis presented in this paper. A cell loss upper bound for heterogeneousON-OFFsources is proposed. The proposed cell loss upper bound is tighter than those previously proposed in the literature. A connection admission control (CAC) scheme using online measurements is designed based on the cell loss upper bound. Extensive simulation is carried out to study the performance of the CAC scheme. Particular attention is paid to the impact of inaccuracies in user-declared traffic parameters on the performance of the CAC scheme. Simulation results indicate that the proposed CAC scheme can ensure QoS guarantee, is robust to inaccuracies in declared traffic parameters, and is capable of achieving high link utilization.
