We study the multicast capacity of large-scale random extended multihop wireless networks, where a number of wireless nodes are randomly located in a square region with side lengtha= √n, by use of Poisson distribution with density 1. All nodes transmit at a constant powerP, and the power decays with attenuation exponent α >2. The data rate of a transmission is determined by the SINR asBlog(1 + SINR), whereBis the bandwidth. There arensrandomly and independently chosen multicast sessions. Each multicast session haskrandomly chosen terminals. We show that whenk≤ θ1n/(logn)2α+6andns≥ θ2n1/2+β, the capacity that each multicast session can achieve, with high probability, is at leastc8√n/ns√k, where θ1, θ2, andc8are some special constants and β >O is any positive real number. We also show that fork=O(n/log2n), the per-flow multicast capacity under Gaussian channel is at mostO(√n/ns√k) when we have at leastns= Ω(logn) random multicast flows. Our result generalizes the unicast capacity for random networks using percolation theory.
