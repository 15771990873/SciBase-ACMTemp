Existing analytical methods to model multistage switch networks cannot be applied to the performance modeling of switch networks with phase-type and bursty traffic because of the problem of state-space explosion and unrealistic assumptions, e.g., uniform traffic and independent destination (UTID). This paper presents an approximate scheme to model and analyze such networks. First, a traffic aggregation technique is proposed to deal with phase-type and bursty traffic, including splitting and merging. For the aggregation of two bursty traffic, a closed-form solution is obtained for buffer state probabilities. For the aggregation of more bursty traffic, a recursive algorithm is derived in terms of the buffer size and number of inputs of a switch. Second, a switch decomposition technique is developed, by which the crossbar of a switch is decomposed from its preceding and succeeding buffers. In this way, a switch network ofNinputs and outputs is converted toNtandem queues, for which the performance can be easily evaluated. Our extensive numerical and simulation examples have shown that the proposed scheme achieves satisfied accuracy and computational efficiency.
