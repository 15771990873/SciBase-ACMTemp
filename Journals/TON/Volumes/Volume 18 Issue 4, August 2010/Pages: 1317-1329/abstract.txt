We study the scaling laws for the throughputs and delays of two coexisting wireless networks that operate in the same geographic region. The primary network consists of Poisson distributed legacy users of densityn, and the secondary network consists of Poisson distributed cognitive users of densitym, withm>n. The primary users have a higher priority to access the spectrum without particular considerations for the secondary users, while the secondary users have to act conservatively in order to limit the interference to the primary users. With a practical assumption that the secondary users only know the locations of the primary transmitters (not the primary receivers), we first show that both networks can achieve the same throughput scaling law as what Gupta and Kumar (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, vol. 46, no. 2, pp. 388-404, Mar. 2000) established for a standalone wireless network if proper transmission schemes are deployed, where a certain throughput is achievable for each individual secondary user (i.e., zero outage) with high probability. By using a fluid model, we also show that both networks can achieve the same delay-throughput tradeoff as the optimal one established by El Gamal et al. (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, vol. 52, no. 6, pp. 2568-2592, Jun. 2006) for a standalone wireless network.
