The design of online algorithms for maximizing the achievable rate in a wireless communication channel between a source and a destination over a fixed number of slots is considered. The source is assumed to be powered by a natural renewable source, and the most general case of arbitrarily varying energy arrivals is considered, where neither the future energy arrival instants or amount nor their distribution is known. The fading coefficients are also assumed to be arbitrarily varying over time, with only causal information available at the source. For a maximization problem, the utility of an online algorithm is tested by finding its competitive ratio or competitiveness that is defined to be the maximum of the ratio of the gain of the optimal offline algorithm and the gain of the online algorithm over all input sequences. We show that the lower bound on the optimal competitive ratio for maximizing the achievable rate is arbitrarily close to the number of slots. Conversely, we propose a simple strategy that invests available energy uniformly over all remaining slots until the next energy arrival, and show that its competitive ratio is equal to the number of slots, to conclude that it is an optimal online algorithm.
