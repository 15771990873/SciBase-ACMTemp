Bloom-filter-based forwarding has been suggested to solve several fundamental problems in the current Internet, such as routing-table growth, multicast scalability issues, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks by botnets. The proposed protocols are source-routed and include the delivery tree encoded as a Bloom filter in each packet. The network nodes forward packets based on this in-packet information without consulting routing tables and without storing per-flow state. We show that these protocols have critical vulnerabilities and make several false security assumptions. In particular, we present DoS attacks against broad classes of Bloom-filter-based protocols and conclude that the protocols are not ready for deployment on open networks. The results also help us understand the limitations and design options for Bloom-filter forwarding.
