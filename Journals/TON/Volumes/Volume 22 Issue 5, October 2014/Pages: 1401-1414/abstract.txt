In a multi-tenant data center environment, the current paradigm for route control customization involves a labor-intensive ticketing process where tenants submit route control requests to the landlord. This results in tight coupling between tenants and the landlord, extensive human resource deployment, and long ticket resolution time. We propose Routing-as-a-Service (RaaS), a framework for tenant-directed route control in data centers. We show that RaaS-based implementation provides a route control platform where multiple tenants can perform route control independently with little administrative involvement, and the landlord can set the overall network policies. RaaS-based solutions can run on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and leverage existing technologies, so it can be implemented in existing networks without major infrastructural overhaul. We present the design of RaaS, introduce its components, and evaluate a prototype based on RaaS.
