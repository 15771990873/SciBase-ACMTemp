We consider the problem of designing distributed scheduling algorithms for wireless networks. We present two algorithms, both of which achieve throughput arbitrarily close to that of maximal schedules, but whose complexity is low due to the fact that they do not necessarily attempt to find maximal schedules. The first algorithm requires each link to collect local queue-length information in its neighborhood, and its complexity is otherwise independent of the size and topology of the network. The second algorithm, presented for the node-exclusive interference model, does not require nodes to collect queue-length information even in their local neighborhoods, and its complexity depends only on the maximum node degree in the network.
