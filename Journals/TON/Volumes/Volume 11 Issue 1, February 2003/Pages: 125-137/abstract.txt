An adaptive medium-access control (MAC) protocol for heterogeneous networks with finite population is proposed. Referred to as the multiqueue service room (MQSR) protocol, this scheme is capable of handling users with different quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. By exploiting the multipacket reception (MPR) capability, the MQSR protocol adaptively grants access to the MPR channel to a number of users such that the expected number of successfully received packets is maximized in each slot. The optimal access protocol avoids unnecessary empty slots for light traffic and excessive collisions for heavy traffic. It has superior throughput and delay performance as compared to, for example, the slotted ALOHA with the optimal retransmission probability. This protocol can be applied to random-access networks with multimedia traffic.
