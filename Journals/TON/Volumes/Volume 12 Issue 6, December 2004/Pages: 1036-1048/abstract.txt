This paper focuses on performance analysis of a CDMA wireless data network based on hierarchy schedule-sensing (HSS) protocol, in which a common-code permission frame beacon is used to schedule request transmissions to avoid packet collisions. To further reduce scheduling delay, hierarchical group-based coding is adopted in the scheme. The performance of such a network is evaluated considering packet collisions with and without packet capture effect using a two-dimensional Markovian chain model. In particular, this paper will study the impact of multiple packet-collision effect on network performance with the help of the average packet-collision rate derived explicitly in the paper. The obtained results show that, despite its low implementation complexity, the HSS protocol is a fairly robust medium-access control protocol featuring uniformly high throughput and short delay even under very high traffic load, which especially suits data-centric wireless networks with relatively small coverage area and great node density.
