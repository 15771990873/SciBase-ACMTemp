Controlling the rate of bulk data multicast to a large number of receivers is difficult, due to the heterogeneity among the end systems' capabilities and their available network bandwidth. If the data transfer rate is too high, some receivers will lose data, and retransmissions will be required. If the data transfer rate is too slow, an inordinate amount of time will be required to transfer the data. In this paper, we examine an approach toward rate-controlled multicast of bulk data in which the sender uses multiple multicast groups to transmit data at different rates to different subgroups of receivers. We present simple algorithms for determining the transmission rate associated with each multicast channel, based on static resource constraints, e.g., network bandwidth bottlenecks. Transmission rates are chosen so as to minimize the average time needed to transfer data to all receivers. Analysis and simulation are used to show that our policies for rate selection perform well for large and diverse receiver groups and make efficient use of network bandwidth. Moreover, we find that only a small number of multicast groups are needed to reap most of the possible performance benefits.
