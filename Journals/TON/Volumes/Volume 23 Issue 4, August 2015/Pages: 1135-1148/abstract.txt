We focus on the problem of efficient communications over access networks with asymmetric bandwidth and capability. We propose a resource-constrained asymmetric redundancy elimination algorithm (RCARE) to leverage downlink bandwidth and receiver capability to accelerate the uplink data transfer. RCARE can be deployed on a client or a proxy. Different from existing asymmetric algorithms, RCARE uses a flexible matching mechanism to identify redundant data and allocates a small sender cache to absorb the high downlink traffic overhead. Compared to existing redundancy elimination algorithms, RCARE provides a scalable sender cache that is adaptive based on resource and performance. We evaluate RCARE with real traffic traces collected from multiple servers and a campus gateway. The trace-driven simulation results indicate that RCARE achieves higher goodput gains and reduces downlink traffic compared to existing asymmetric communication algorithms. We design an adaptation algorithm for resource-constrained senders sending multiple data streams. Our algorithm takes samples from data streams and predicts how to invest cache size on individual data streams to achieve maximal uplink goodput gain. The adaptation algorithm improves the goodput gain by up to 87% compared to the baseline. In first 10% of data streams (sorted by the optimal goodput gains), RCARE achieves up to 42% goodput gain on average.
