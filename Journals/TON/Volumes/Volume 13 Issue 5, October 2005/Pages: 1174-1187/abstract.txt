We consider the problem of precomputing constrained widest paths and multicast trees in a communication network. Precomputing and storing of the relevant information minimizes the computational overhead required to determine an optimal path when a new connection request arrives. We evaluate algorithms that precompute paths with maximal bandwidth (widest paths), which in addition satisfy given end-to-end delay constraints. We analyze and compare both the worst case and average case performance of the algorithms. We also show how the precomputed paths can be used to provide computationally efficient solutions to the constrained widest multicast tree problem. In this problem, a multicast tree with maximal bandwidth (widest multicast tree) is sought, which in addition satisfies given end-to-end delay constraints for each path on the tree from the source to a multicast destination.
