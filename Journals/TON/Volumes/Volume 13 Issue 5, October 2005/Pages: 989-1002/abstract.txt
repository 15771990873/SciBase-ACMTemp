In wireless mobile networks, quantities such as call blocking probability, call dropping probability, handoff probability, handoff rate, and the actual call holding times for both complete and incomplete calls are very important performance parameters in the network performance evaluation and design. In the past, their analytical computations are given only when the classical exponential assumptions for all involved time variables are imposed. In this paper, we relax the exponential assumptions for the involved time variables and, under independence assumption on the cell residence times, derive analytical formulae for these parameters using a novel unifying analytical approach. It turns out that the computation of many performance parameters is boiled down to computing a certain type of probability, and the obtained analytical results can be easily applied when the Laplace transform of probability density function of call holding time is a rational function. Thus, easily computable results can be obtained when the call holding time is distributed with the mixed-Erlang distribution, a distribution model having universal approximation capability. More importantly, this paper develops a new analytical approach to performance evaluation for wireless networks and mobile computing systems.
