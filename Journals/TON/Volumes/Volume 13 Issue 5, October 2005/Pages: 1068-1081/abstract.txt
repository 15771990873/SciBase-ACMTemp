This paper introduces and analyzes a decentralized network congestion control algorithm which has dynamic adaptations at both user ends and link ends, a so-called general primal-dual algorithm. We obtain sufficient conditions for local stability of this algorithm in a general topology network with heterogeneous round-trip delays. Then, as an implementation of this algorithm in the Internet, we introduce an AQM (Active Queue Management) scheme called Exponential-RED (E-RED), which outperforms RED and is inherently stable when combined with TCP-Reno or its variants for high-speed networks.
