We propose an efficient parallel switching architecture that requires no speedup and guarantees bounded delay. Our architecture consists ofkinput-output-queued switches with first-in-first-out queues, operating at the line speed in parallel under the control of asinglescheduler, withkbeing independent of the numberNof inputs and outputs. Arriving traffic is demultiplexed (spread) over thekidentical switches, switched to the correct output, and multiplexed (combined) before departing from the parallel switch.We show that by using an appropriate demultiplexing strategy at the inputs and by applying thesame matchingat each of thekparallel switches during each cell slot, our scheme guarantees a way for cells of a flow to be read in order from the output queues of the switches, thus, eliminating the need for cell resequencing. Further, by allowing the scheduler to examine the state of only the first of thekparallel switches, our scheme also reduces considerably the amount of state information required by the scheduler. The switching algorithms that we develop are based on existing practical switching algorithms for input-queued switches, and have an additional communication complexity that is optimal up to a constant factor.
