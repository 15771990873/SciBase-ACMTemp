Multicast/broadcast is regarded as an efficient technique for wireless cellular networks to transmit a large volume of common data to multiple mobile users simultaneously. To guarantee the quality of service for each mobile user in such single-hop multicasting, the base-station transmitter usually adapts its data rate to the worst channel condition among all users in a multicast group. On one hand, increasing the number of users in a multicast group leads to a more efficient utilization of spectrum bandwidth, as users in the same group can be served together. On the other hand, too many users in a group may lead to unacceptably low data rate at which the base station can transmit. Hence, a natural question that arises is how to efficiently and fairly transmit to a large number of users requiring the same message. This paper endeavors to answer this question by studying the problem of multicasting over multicarriers in wireless orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) cellular systems. Using a unified utility maximization framework, we investigate this problem in two typical scenarios: namely, when users experience roughly equal path losses and when they experience different path losses, respectively. Through theoretical analysis, we obtain optimal multicast schemes satisfying various throughput-fairness requirements in these two cases. In particular, we show that the conventional multicast scheme is optimal in the equal-path-loss case regardless of the utility function adopted. When users experience different path losses, the group multicast scheme, which divides the users almost equally into many multicast groups and multicasts to different groups of users over nonoverlapping subcarriers, is optimal.
