Among the most critical issues of wireless ad hoc and sensor networks are energy consumption in general and interfer-ence in particular. The reduction of interference is consequently considered one of the foremost goals of topology control. Almost all of the related work however considers this issue implicitly: Low interference is often claimed to be a consequence of sparseness or low degree of the constructed topologies. This paper, in contrast, studies explicit definitions of interference. Various models of in-terference--both from a sender-centric and a receiver-centric per-spective--are proposed, compared, and analyzed with respect to their algorithmic properties and complexities.
