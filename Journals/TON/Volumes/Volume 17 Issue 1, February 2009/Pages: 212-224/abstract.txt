Multi-path transport is an important mechanism for supporting video communications in multihop wireless networks. In this paper, we investigate the joint problem of optimal path se-lection and rate allocation for multiple video sessions in a wire-less mesh network. We present a mathematical formulation to op-timize the application level performance (i.e., video distortion) in the context of path selection and rate allocation. For this complex optimization problem, we propose a branch-and-bound based so-lution procedure, embedded with the Reformulation-Linearization Technique (RLT) that can produce (1 - Ε)-optimal solutions for any small Ε. This result is significant as it not only provides the-oretical understanding of this problem, but also offers a perfor-mance benchmark for any future proposed distributed algorithm and protocol for this problem. Simulation results are also provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the solution procedure.
