Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is a continuous critical threat to the Internet. Derived from the low layers, new application-layer-based DDoS attacks utilizing legitimate HTTP requests to overwhelm victim resources are more undetectable. The case may be more serious when such attacks mimic or occur during the flash crowd event of a popular Website. Focusing on the detection for such new DDoS attacks, a scheme based on document popularity is introduced. An Access Matrix is defined to capture the spatial-temporal patterns of a normal flash crowd. Principal component analysis and independent component analysis are applied to abstract the multidimensional Access Matrix. A novel anomaly detector based on hidden semi-Markov model is proposed to describe the dynamics of Access Matrix and to detect the attacks. The entropy of document popularity fitting to the model is used to detect the potential application-layer DDoS attacks. Numerical results based on real Web traffic data are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
