The influence of the network characteristics on the virus spread is analyzed in a new--theN-intertwined Markov chain--model, whose only approximation lies in the application of mean field theory. The mean field approximation is quantified in detail. TheN-intertwined model has been compared with the exact 2N-state Markov model and with previously proposed "homogeneous" or "local" models. The sharp epidemic threshold τc, which is a consequence of mean field theory, is rigorously shown to be equal to τc= 1/(λmax(A)), where λmax(A) is the largest eigenvalue--the spectral radius--of the adjacency matrixA. A continued fraction expansion of the steady-state infection probability at nodejis presented as well as several upper bounds.
