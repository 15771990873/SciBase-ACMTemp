The union of all shortest path treesGUsptis the maximally observable part of a network when traffic follows shortest paths. Overlay networks such as peer to peer networks or virtual private networks can be regarded as a subgraph ofGUspt. We investigate properties ofGUsptin different underlying topologies with regular i.i.d. link weights. In particular, we show that the overlayGUsptin an Erdös-Rényi random graphGp(N) is a connectedGPc(N) wherePc∼ logN/Nis the critical link density, an observation with potential for ad-hoc networks.Shortest paths and, thus also the overlayGUspt, can be controlled by link weights. By tuning the power exponent α of polynomial link weights in different underlying graphs, the phase transitions in the structure ofGUsptare shown by simulations to follow a same universal curveFT(α) = Pr[GUsptis a tree]. The existence of a controllable phase transition in networks may allow network operators to steer and balance flows in their network. The structure ofGUsptin terms of the extreme value index α is further examined together with its spectrum, the eigenvalues of the corresponding adjacency matrix ofGUspt.
