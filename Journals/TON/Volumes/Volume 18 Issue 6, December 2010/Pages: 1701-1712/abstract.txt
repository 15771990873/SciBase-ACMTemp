In this paper, we consider the classical problem of link scheduling in wireless networks under an accurate interference model, in which correct packet reception at a receiver node depends on the signa-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). While most previous work on wireless networks has addressed the scheduling problem using simplistic graph-based or distance-based interference models, a few recent papers have investigated scheduling with SINR-based interference models. However, these papers have either used approximations to the SINR model or have ignored important aspects of the problem. We study the problem of wireless link scheduling under the exact SINR model and present the first known true approximation algorithms for transmission scheduling under the exact model. We also introduce an algorithm with a proven approximation bound with respect to the length of the optimal schedule under primary interference. As an aside, our study identifies a class of "difficult to schedule" links, which hinder the derivation of tighter approximation bounds. Furthermore, we characterize conditions under which scheduling under SINR-based interference is within a constant factor from optimal under primary interference, which implies that secondary interference only degrades performance by a constant factor in these situations.
