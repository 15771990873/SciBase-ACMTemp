In this paper, we revisit the problem of determining the minimum-length schedule that satisfies certain traffic demands in a wireless network. Traditional approaches for the determination of minimum-length schedules are based on a collision channel model, in which neighboring transmissions cause destructive interference if and only if they are within the "interference region" of the receiving nodes. By contrast, we adopt here a more realistic model for the physical layer by requiring that a threshold be exceeded by the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for a transmission to be successful. We present a novel formulation of the problem that incorporates various power and rate adaptation schemes while seamlessly integrating the generation of "matchings" (i.e., sets of links that can be activated simultaneously) by taking into consideration the SINR constraints at the receivers. For the formulated problem, we propose a column-generation-based solution method and show that it theoretically converges to a globally optimal solution, with a potential advantage of not having to enumerate all the feasible matchings a priori. We also discuss the influence of power control, spatial reuse, and variable transmission rates on network performance. Furthermore, we include aspects of the routing problem and provide computational results for our proposed column-generation-based solution procedure.
