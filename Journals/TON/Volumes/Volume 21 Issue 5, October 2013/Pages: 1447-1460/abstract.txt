To meet the capacity demands from ever-increasing mobile data usage, mobile network operators are moving toward smaller cell structures. These small cells, called femtocells, use sophisticated air interface technologies such as orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA). While femtocells are expected to provide numerous benefits such as energy efficiency and better throughput, the interference resulting from their dense deployments prevents such benefits from being harnessed in practice. Thus, there is an evident need for a resource management solution to mitigate the interference that occurs between collocated femtocells. In this paper, we design and implement one of the first resource management systems, FERMI, for OFDMA-based femtocell networks. As part of its design, FERMI: 1) provides resource isolation in the frequency domain (as opposed to time) to leverage power pooling across cells to improve capacity; 2) uses measurement-driven triggers to intelligently distinguish clients that require just link adaptation from those that require resource isolation; 3) incorporates mechanisms that enable the joint scheduling of both types of clients in the same frame; and 4) employs efficient, scalable algorithms to determine a fair resource allocation across the entire network with high utilization and low overhead. We implement FERMI on a prototype four-cell WiMAX femtocell testbed and show that it yields significant gains over conventional approaches.
