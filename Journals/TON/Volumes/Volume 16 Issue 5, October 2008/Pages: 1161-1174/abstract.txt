In this paper, we address the following two questions concerning the capacity and configuration of fixed wireless networks: (i) given a set of wireless nodes with arbitrary but fixed locations, and a set of data flows, what is the max-min achievable throughput? and (ii) how should the network be configured to achieve the optimum? We consider these questions from a networking standpoint assuming point-to-point links, and employ a rigorous physical layer model to model conflict relationships between them. Since we seek capacity results, we assume that the network is operated using an appropriate schedule of conflict-free link activations. We develop and investigate a novel optimization framework to determine the optimal throughput and configuration, i.e., flow routes, link activation schedules and physical layer parameters. Determining the optimal throughput is a computationally hard problem, in general. However, using a smart enumerative technique we obtain numerical results for several different scenarios of interest. We obtain several important insights into the structure of the optimal routes, schedules and physical layer parameters. Besides determining the achievable throughput, we believe that our optimization-based framework can also be used as a tool, for configuring scheduled wireless networks, such as those based on IEEE 802.16.
