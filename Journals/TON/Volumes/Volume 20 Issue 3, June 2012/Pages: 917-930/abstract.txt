It has been shown in a previous version of this paper that hierarchical cooperation achieves a linear throughput scaling for unicast traffic, which is due to the advantage of long-range concurrent transmissions and the technique of distributed multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO). In this paper, we investigate the scaling law for multicast traffic with hierarchical cooperation, where each of thennodes communicates withkrandomly chosen destination nodes. Specifically, we propose a new class of scheduling policies for multicast traffic. By utilizing the hierarchical cooperative MIMO transmission, our new policies can obtain an aggregate throughput of Ω((n/k)1-ε) for any ε ≥ 0. This achieves a gain of nearly √n/kcompared to the noncooperative scheme in Li et al.'s work (Proc. ACM MobiCom, 2007, pp. 266-277). Among all four cooperative strategies proposed in our paper, one is superior in terms of the three performance metrics: throughput, delay, and energy consumption. Two factors contribute to the optimal performance: multihop MIMO transmission and converge-based scheduling. Compared to the single-hop MIMO transmission strategy, the multihop strategy achieves a throughput gain of (n/k)h-1/h(2h-1)and meanwhile reduces the energy consumption bykα-2/2times approximately, whereh> 1 is the number of the hierarchical layers, and α ≥ 2 is the path-loss exponent. Moreover, to schedule the traffic with the converge multicast instead of the pure multicast strategy, we can dramatically reduce the delay by a factor of about (n/k)h/2. Our optimal cooperative strategy achieves an approximate delay-throughput tradeoffD(n, k)/T(n, k)= Θ(k) whenh→ ∞. This tradeoff ratio is identical to that of noncooperative scheme, while the throughput is greatly improved.
