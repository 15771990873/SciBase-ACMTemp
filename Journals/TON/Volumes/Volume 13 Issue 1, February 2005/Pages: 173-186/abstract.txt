We consider the problem of wavelength assignment in reconfigurable WDM networks with wavelength converters. We show that forN-nodeP-port bidirectional rings, a minimum number of ⌈PN/4⌉ wavelengths are required to support all possible connected virtual topologies in a rearrangeably nonblocking fashion, and provide an algorithm that meets this bound using no more than ⌈PN/2⌉ wavelength converters. This improves over the tight lower bound of ⌈PN/3⌉ wavelengths required for such rings given in [1] if no wavelength conversion is available. We extend this to the generalP-port case where each nodeimay have a different number of ports,Piand show that no more than ⌈ΣiPi/4⌉ + 1 wavelengths are required. We then provide a second algorithm that uses more wavelengths yet requires significantly fewer converters. We also develop a method that allows the wavelength converters to be arbitrarily located at any node in the ring. This gives significant flexibility in the design of the networks. For example, all ⌈PN/2⌉ converters can be collocated at a single hub node, or distributed evenly among theNnodes with min {⌈P/2⌉ + 1,P} converters at each node.
