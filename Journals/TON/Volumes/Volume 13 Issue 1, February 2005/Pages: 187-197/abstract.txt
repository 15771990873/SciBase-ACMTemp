In this paper, we analyze the blocking probability of distributed lightpath establishment in wavelength-routed WDM networks by studying the two basic methods: destination-initiated reservation (DIR) and source-initiated reservation (SIR). We discuss three basic types of connection blocking: 1) blocking due to insufficient network capacity; 2) blocking due to outdated information; and 3) blocking due to over-reservation. It is shown that the proposed models are highly accurate for both the DIR and the SIR methods, in both the regular and irregular network topologies, under the whole range of traffic loads.
