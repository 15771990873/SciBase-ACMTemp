Understanding the packet delivery performance of a wireless sensor network (WSN) is critical for improving system performance and exploring future developments and applications of WSN techniques. In spite of many empirical measurements in the literature, we still lack in-depth understanding on how and to what extent different factors contribute to the overall packet losses for a complete stack of protocols at large scale. Specifically, very little is known about: 1) when, where, and under what kind of circumstances packet losses occur; 2) why packets are lost. As a step toward addressing those issues, we deploy a large-scale WSN and design a measurement system for retrieving important system metrics. We propose MAP, a step-by-step methodology to identify the losses, extract system events, and perform spatial-temporal correlation analysis by employing a carefully examined causal graph. MAP enables us to get a closer look at the root causes of packet losses in a low-power ad hoc network. This study validates some earlier conjectures on WSNs and reveals some new findings. The quantitative results also shed lights for future large-scale WSN deployments.
