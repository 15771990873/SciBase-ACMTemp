Though the widely used Tor anonymity network is designed to enable low-latency anonymous communication, interactive communications on Tor incur latencies over 5 greater than on the direct Internet path, and in many cases, autonomous systems (ASs) can compromise anonymity via correlations of network traffic. In this paper, we develop LASTor, a new Tor client that addresses these shortcomings in Tor with only client-side modifications. First, LASTor improves communication latencies by accounting for the inferred locations of Tor relays while choosing paths. Since the preference for shorter paths reduces the entropy of path selection, we design LASTor so that a user can choose an appropriate tradeoff between latency and anonymity. Second, we develop an efficient and accurate algorithm to identify paths on which an AS can compromise anonymity by traffic correlation. LASTor avoids such paths to improve a user's anonymity, and the low run-time of the algorithm ensures that the impact on end-to-end communication latencies is low. Our results show that, in comparison to the default Tor client, LASTor reduces median latencies by 25% while also reducing the false negative rate of not detecting a potential snooping AS from 57% to 11%.
