A Surjective-Mapping based Model (SMM) is developed to evaluate the performance of a slotted optical shared-buffer cross-connect. The model is simple, accurate, and yet provides comprehensive performance characteristics of the switch. The model also overcomes the limitations of traditional Markovian based models in evaluating moderate to large switches, associated with the explosion of number of states. The model is verified using simulation results for different switch sizes and different numbers of delay lines. The model enables dimensioning the switch architecture to meet the target performance. Performance of optical shared-buffer cross-connect is analyzed in detail, in terms of blocking probability, delay distribution, and delay line utilization.
