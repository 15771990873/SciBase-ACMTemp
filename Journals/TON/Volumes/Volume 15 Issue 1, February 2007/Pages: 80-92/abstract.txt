Flooding is a commonly used technique for network resource and topology information dissemination in the data communication networks. However, due to the well-knownN-squared problem it causes network delay in response or even congestion. We propose a new flooding technique, called Lazy Flooding; it floods only when links reach a certain status. It significantly cuts down the number of floods and thus improves the data communication network response time. On the other hand, it has negligible effect on the network performance due to the selected flooding.
