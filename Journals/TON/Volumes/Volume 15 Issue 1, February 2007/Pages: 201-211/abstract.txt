A fundamental problem in quality-of-service (QoS) routing is to find a path between a source-destination node pair that satisfies two or more end-to-end QoS constraints. We model this problem using a graph withnvertices andmedges withKadditive QoS parameters associated with each edge, for any constantK≥ 2. This problem is known to be NP-hard. Fully polynomial time approximation schemes (FPTAS) for the case ofK= 2 have been reported in the literature. We concentrate on the general case and make the following contributions. 1) We present a very simpleO(Km+nlogn) timeK-approximation algorithm that can be used in hop-by-hop routing protocols. 2) We present an FPTAS for one optimization version of the QoS routing problem with a time complexity ofO(m(n/ε)K-1).3) We present an FPTAS for another optimization version of the QoS routing problem with a time complexity ofO(nlogn+m(H/ε)K-1) when there exists anH-hop path satisfying all QoS constraints. WhenKis reduced to 2, our results compare favorably with existing algorithms. The results of this paper hold for both directed and undirected graphs. For ease of presentation, undirected graph is used.
