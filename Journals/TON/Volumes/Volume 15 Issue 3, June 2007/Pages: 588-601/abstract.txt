We study a fixed-point formalization of the well-known analysis of Bianchi. We provide a significant simplification and generalization of the analysis. In this more general framework, the fixed-point solution and performance measures resulting from it are studied. Uniqueness of the fixed point is established. Simple and general throughput formulas are provided. It is shown that the throughput of any flow will be bounded by the one with the smallest transmission rate. The aggregate throughput is bounded by the reciprocal of the harmonic mean of the transmission rates. In an asymptotic regime with a large number of nodes, explicit formulas for the collision probability, the aggregate attempt rate, and the aggregate throughput are provided. The results from the analysis are compared withns2 simulations and also with an exact Markov model of the backoff process. It is shown how the saturated network analysis can be used to obtain TCP transfer throughputs in some cases.
