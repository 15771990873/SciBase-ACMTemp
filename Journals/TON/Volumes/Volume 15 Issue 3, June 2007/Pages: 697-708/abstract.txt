In this paper, we shall generalize the concepts of fairness, TCP-friendliness and TCP-compatibility such that more source adaptation schemes can be designed to support diverse applications over the Internet. A simple but efficient framework, in the form of a monotonic response function (MRF), is proposed for the analysis and the design of memoryless window-based source adaptation protocols by using these concepts. We first derive a necessary and sufficient condition for step-wise convergence to the weighted fairness. It is then used to construct increase-decrease policies. The requirements of our increase-decrease policy are less conservative than those of the CYRF (Choose Your Response Function) that was proposed in [1]. Our MRF is suitable for transmission control protocol (TCP) and user datagram protocol (UDP), and can be used to design TCP-friendly and multimedia-friendly source adaptation schemes. Meanwhile, our MRF can be applied to provide bandwidth differentiation service without any change to the router of the existing Internet.
