A multi-hop network of wireless sensors can be used to gather spatio-temporal samples of a physical phenomenon and transmit these samples to a processing center. This paper addresses an important issue in the design of such networks: determining the spatio-temporal sampling rate of the network under conditions of minimum energy usage. A new collision-free protocol for gathering sensor data is used to obtain analytical results that characterize the tradeoffs among sensor density, energy usage, throughput, delay, temporal sampling rates and spatial sampling rates in wireless sensor networks. We also show that the lower bound on the delay incurred in gathering data isO(k2n) in a clustered network ofnsensors with at mostkhops between any sensor and its clusterhead (CH). Simulation results on the tradeoff between the achievable spatial sampling rates and the achievable temporal sampling rates when IEEE 802.11 distributed coordination function (DCF) is used as the media access scheme are provided and compared with the analytical results obtained in this paper.
