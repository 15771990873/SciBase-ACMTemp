Most existing topology control algorithms assume homogeneous wireless networks with uniform maximal transmission power, and cannot be directly applied to heterogeneous wireless networks where the maximal transmission power of each node may be different. We present two localized topology control algorithms for heterogeneous networks: Directed Relative Neighborhood Graph (DRNG) and Directed Local Spanning Subgraph (DLSS). In both algorithms, each node independently builds its neighbor set by adjusting the transmission power, and defines the network topology by using only local information. We prove that: 1) both DRNG and DLSS can preserve network connectivity; 2) the out-degree of any node in the resulting topology generated by DRNG or DLSS is bounded by a constant; and 3) DRNG and DLSS can preserve network bi-directionality. Simulation results indicate that DRNG and DLSS significantly outperform existing topology control algorithms for heterogeneous networks in several aspects.
