This paper develops a new network provisioning and resource allocation scheme. We introduce the concept of the effective burstiness curve (EBC), which is defined as a percentile of the maximum burstiness curve. For a fixed service rate, EBC represents the size of a buffer for which the probability of buffer overflow is arbitrarily small. We show that EBC is a convex nonincreasing function of the service rate. We also introduce the empirical effective burstiness curve (EEBC), an estimator of EBC, which can be obtained with a water-filling algorithm. For discrete queue size, EEBC can be evaluated with a recursive algorithm. The technique is applied to MPEG4 encoded video traces.
