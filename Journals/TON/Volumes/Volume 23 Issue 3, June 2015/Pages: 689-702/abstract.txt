Federation of geo-distributed cloud services is a trend in cloud computing that, by spanning multiple data centers at different geographical locations, can provide a cloud platform with much larger capacities. Such a geo-distributed cloud is ideal for supporting large-scale social media applications with dynamic contents and demands. Although promising, its realization presents challenges on how to efficiently store and migrate contents among different cloud sites and how to distribute user requests to the appropriate sites for timely responses at modest costs. These challenges escalate when we consider the persistently increasing contents and volatile user behaviors in a social media application. By exploiting social influences among users, this paper proposes efficient proactive algorithms for dynamic, optimal scaling of a social media application in a geo-distributed cloud. Our key contribution is an online content migration and request distribution algorithm with the following features: 1) future demand prediction by novelly characterizing social influences among the users in a simple but effective epidemic model; 2) one-shot optimal content migration and request distribution based on efficient optimization algorithms to address the predicted demand; and 3) a Î”(t)-step look-ahead mechanism to adjust the one-shot optimization results toward the offline optimum. We verify the effectiveness of our online algorithm by solid theoretical analysis, as well as thorough comparisons to ready algorithms including the ideal offline optimum, using large-scale experiments with dynamic realistic settings on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).
