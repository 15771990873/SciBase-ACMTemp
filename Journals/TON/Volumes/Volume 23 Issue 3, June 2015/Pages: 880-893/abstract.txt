In this paper, we focus on the scheduling problem in multichannel wireless networks, e.g., the downlink of a single cell in fourth-generation (4G) OFDM-based cellular networks. Our goal is to design practical scheduling policies that can achieveprovably good performancein terms of boththroughputanddelay, at alow complexity.While a class ofO(n2.5logn)-complexity hybrid scheduling policies is recently developed to guarantee both rate-function delay optimality (in the many-channel many-userasymptoticregime) and throughput optimality (in the generalnon-asymptoticsetting), their practical complexity is typically high. To address this issue, we develop a simple greedy policy calledDelay-based Server-Side-Greedy(D-SSG) with alower complexity2n2+ 2n, and rigorously prove that D-SSG not only achievesthroughput optimality, but also guaranteesnear-optimal asymptotic delay performance.Specifically, the rate-function of the delay-violation probability attained by D-SSG for any fixed integer delay thresholdb> 0 is no smaller than the maximum achievable rate-function by any scheduling policy for thresholdb-- 1. Thus, we are able to achieve a reduction in complexity (fromO(n2.5logn) of the hybrid policies to 2n2+ 2n) with a minimal drop in the delay performance. More importantly, in practice, D-SSG generally has a substantially lower complexity than the hybrid policies that typically have a large constant factor hidden in theO(Â·) notation. Finally, we conduct simulations to validate our theoretical results in various scenarios. The simulation results show that in all scenarios we consider, D-SSG not only guarantees a near-optimal rate-function, but also empirically has a similar delay performance to the rate-function delay-optimal policies.
