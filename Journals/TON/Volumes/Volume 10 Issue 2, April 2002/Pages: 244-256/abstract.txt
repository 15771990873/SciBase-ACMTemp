Multiconstrained quality-of-service (QoS) routing deals with finding routes that satisfy multiple independent QoS constraints. This problem is NP-hard. In this paper, two heuristics, the limited granularity heuristic and the limited path heuristic, are investigated. Both heuristics extend the Bellman-Ford shortest path algorithm and solve generalk-constrained QoS routing problems. Analytical and simulation studies are conducted to compare the time/space requirements of the heuristics and the effectiveness of the heuristics in finding paths that satisfy the QoS constraints. The major results of this paper are the following. For anN-nodes andE-edges network withk(a small constant) independent QoS constraints, the limited granularity heuristic must maintain a table of sizeO(|N|k- 1) in each node to be effective, which results in a time complexity ofO(|N|K|E|); while the limited path heuristic can achieve very high performance by maintainingO(|N|2lg(|N|)) entries in each node. These results indicate that the limited path heuristic is relatively insensitive to the number of constraints and is superior to the limited granularity heuristic in solvingk-constrained QoS routing problems whenk> 3.
