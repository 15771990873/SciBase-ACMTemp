In this paper, we develop a framework for user association in infrastructure-based wireless networks, specifically focused on flow-level cell load balancing under spatially inhomogeneous traffic distributions. Our work encompasses several different user association policies: rate-optimal, throughput-optimal, delay-optimal, and load-equalizing, which we collectively denote α-optimal user association. We prove that the optimal load vector ρ* that minimizes a generalized system performance function is the fixed point of a certain mapping. Based on this mapping, we propose and analyze an iterative distributed user association policy that adapts to spatial traffic loads and converges to a globally optimal allocation.We then address admission control policies for the case where the system is overloaded. For an appropriate systemlevel cost function, the optimal admission control policy blocks all flows at cells edges. However, providing a minimum level of connectivity to all spatial locations might be desirable. To this end, a location-dependent random blocking and user association policy are proposed.
