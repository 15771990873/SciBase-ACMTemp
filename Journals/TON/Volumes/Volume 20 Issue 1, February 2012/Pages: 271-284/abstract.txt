What topologies should be used to evaluate protocols for interdomain routing? Using the most current Internet topology is not practical since its size is prohibitive for detailed, packet-level interdomain simulations. Besides being of moderate size, the topology should be policy-aware, that is, it needs to represent business relationships between adjacent nodes (that represent autonomous systems). In this paper, we address this issue by providing a framework to generate small, realistic, and policy-aware topologies. We propose HBR, a novel sampling method, which exploits the inherent hierarchy of the policy-aware Internet topology. We formally prove that our approach generates connected and legitimate topologies, which are compatible with the policy-based routing conventions and rules. Using simulations, we show that HBR generates topologies that: 1) maintain the graph properties of the real topology; 2) provide reasonably realistic interdomain simulation results while reducing the computational complexity by several orders of magnitude as compared to the initial topology. Our approach provides a permanent solution to the problem of interdomain routing evaluations: Given a more accurate and complete topology, HBR can generate better small topologies in the future.
