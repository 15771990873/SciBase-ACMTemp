The problem of determining what links can be simultaneously activated in a wireless network such that a signal-to-interference-and-noise (SINR) constraint is satisfied at all receivers is considered. The term "feasible matching" is introduced to describe a set of (transmitter, receiver) pairs for which there exists some set of transmit powers which can simultaneously meet the SINR equirements at the receivers. Given disjoint equally sized sets of transmitters and receivers, it is shown that when the SINR requirement at the receivers is greater than 1, no more than one feasible matching between the transmitters and the receivers exists. Sufficient conditions are provided under which certain broad classes of matchings in a network are guaranteed to be feasible; for example all matchings involvingkor fewer links. The application of these results toad hocwireless networks and to scheduling is discussed.
