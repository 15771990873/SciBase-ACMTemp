We examine the throughput benefits that network coding offers with respect to the average throughput achievable by routing, where the average throughput refers to the average of the rates that the individual receivers experience. We relate these benefits to the integrality gap of a standard linear programming formulation for the directed Steiner tree problem. We describe families of configurations over which network coding at most doubles the average throughput, and analyze a class of directed graph configurations withNreceivers where network coding offers benefits proportional to âˆšN. We also discuss other throughput measures in networks, and show how in certain classes of networks, average throughput bounds can be translated into minimum throughput bounds, by employing vector routing and channel coding. Finally, we show configurations where use of randomized coding may require an alphabet size exponentially larger than the minimum alphabet size required.
