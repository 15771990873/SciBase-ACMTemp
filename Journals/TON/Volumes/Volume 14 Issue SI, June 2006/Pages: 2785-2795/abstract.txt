This correspondence considers the problem of distributed source coding of multiple sources over a network with multiple receivers. Each receiver seeks to reconstruct all of the original sources. The work by Ho et al. 2004 demonstrates that random network coding can solve this problem at the potentially high cost of jointly decoding the source and the network code. Motivated by complexity considerations we consider the performance of separate source and network codes. Previous work by Effros et al. 2003 demonstrates the failure of separation between source and network codes for nonmulticast networks.We demonstrate that failure for multicast networks. We study networks with capacity constraints on edges. It is shown that the problem with two sources and two receivers is always separable. Counterexamples are presented for other cases.
