The goal of this paper is to establish which practical routing schemes for wireless networks are most suitable for power-limited and bandwidth-limited communication regimes. We regard channel state information (CSI) at the receiver and point-to-point capacity-achieving codes for the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel as practical features, interference cancellation (IC) as possible, but less practical, and synchronous cooperation (CSI at the transmitters) as impractical. We consider a communication network with a single source node, a single destination node, andN-1 intermediate nodes placed equidistantly on a line between them. We analyze the minimum total transmit power needed to achieve a desired end-to-end rate for several schemes and demonstrate that multihop communication with spatial reuse performs very well in the power-limited regime, even without IC. However, within a class of schemes not performing IC, single-hop transmission (directly from source to destination) is more suitable for the bandwidth-limited regime, especially when higher spectral efficiencies are required. At such higher spectral efficiencies, the gap between single-hop and multihop can be closed by employing IC, and we present a scheme based upon backward decoding that can remove all interference from the multihop system with an arbitrarily small rate loss. This new scheme is also used to demonstrate that rates ofO(logN) are achievable over linear wireless networks even without synchronous cooperation.
