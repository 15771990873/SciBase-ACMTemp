In this correspondence, we consider the problem of constructing an erasure code for storage over a network when the data sources are distributed. Specifically, we assume that there arenstorage nodes with limited memory andk<nsources generating the data. We want a data collector, who can appear anywhere in the network, to query anykstorage nodes and be able to retrieve the data. We introduce decentralized erasure codes, which are linear codes with a specific randomized structure inspired by network coding on random bipartite graphs. We show that decentralized erasure codes are optimally sparse, and lead to reduced communication, storage and computation cost over random linear coding.
