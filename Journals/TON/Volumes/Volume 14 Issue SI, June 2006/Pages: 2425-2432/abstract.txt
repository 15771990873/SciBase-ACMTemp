The multicast capacity is determined for networks that have deterministic channels with broadcasting at the transmitters and no interference at the receivers. The multicast capacity is shown to have a cut-set interpretation. It is further shown that one cannot always layer channel and network coding in such networks. The proof of the latter result partially generalizes to discrete memoryless broadcast channels and is used to bound the common rate for problems where one achieves a cut bound on throughput.
