In this paper, we characterize the throughput of a broadcast network withnreceivers using rateless codes with block sizeK. We assume that the underlying channel is a Markov modulated erasure channel that is i.i.d. across users, but can be correlated in time. We characterize the system throughput asymptotically inn. Specifically, we explicitly show how the throughput behaves for different values of the coding block sizeKas a function ofn, asn. → ∞. For finite values ofKandn, under the more restrictive assumption of Gilbert-Elliott erasure channels, we are able to provide a lower bound on the maximum achievable throughput. Using simulations, we show the tightness of the bound with respect to system parametersnandKand find that its performance is significantly better than the previously known lower bounds.
