We formulate adaptation of antenna tilt angle as a utility fair optimization task. This optimization problem is nonconvex, but in this paper we show that, under reasonable conditions, it can be reformulated as a convex optimization. Using this insight, we develop a lightweight method for finding the optimal antenna tilt angles, making use of measurements that are already available at base stations, and suited to distributed implementation.
