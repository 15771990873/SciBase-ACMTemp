Internet quality of service (QoS) is still a highly debated topic for more than fifteen years. Even with the large variety of QoS proposals and the impressive research advances, there is little deployment yet of network layer QoS technology. One specific problem domain is QoS signalling, which has recently attracted increasing attention to bring forward new standardization approaches. In this paper, an extensive study of RSVP is presented, covering protocol design, software design, and performance aspects of the basic version of RSVP and of certain standardized and experimental extensions. This work is based on and presents the experience from implementing RSVP for UNIX systems and the ns-2 simulation environment. The implementation includes a variety of protocol extensions and incorporates several internal improvements. It has been subject to extensive functional and performance evaluations, the results of which are reported here.
