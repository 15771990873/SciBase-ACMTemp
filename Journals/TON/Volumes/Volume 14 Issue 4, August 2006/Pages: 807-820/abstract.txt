In this paper, we propose a new novel polling-based medium access control protocol, named UPCF (Unified Point Coordination Function), to provide power conservation and quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees for multimedia applications over wireless local area networks. Specifically, UPCF has the following attractive features. First, it supports multiple priority levels and guarantees that high-priority stations always join the polling list earlier than low-priority stations. Second, it provides fast reservation scheme such that associated stations with real-time traffic can get on the polling list in bounded time. Third, it employs dynamic channel time allocation scheme to support CBR/VBR transportation and provide per-flow probabilistic bandwidth assurance. Fourth, it employs the power management techniques to let mobile stations save as much energy as possible. Fifth, it adopts the mobile-assisted admission control technique such that the point coordinator can admit as many newly flows as possible while not violating QoS guarantees made to already-admitted flows. The performance of UPCF is evaluated through both analysis and simulations. Simulation results do confirm that, as compared with the PCF in IEEE 802.11, UPCF not only provides higher goodput and energy throughput, but also achieves lower power consumption and frame loss due to delay expiry. Last but not least, we expect that UPCF can pass the current Wi-Fi certification and may coexist with the upcoming IEEE 802.11e standard.
