In this paper, we focus on the performance of TCP enhancements for a hybrid terrestrial-satellite network. While a large body of literature exists regarding modeling TCP performance for the wired Internet, and recently over a single-hop wireless link, the literature is very sparse on TCP analysis over a hybrid wired-wireless (multi-hop) path. We seek to make a contribution to this problem (where the wireless segment is a satellite uplink) by deriving analytical estimates of TCP throughput for two widely deployed approaches: TCP splitting and E2E (End-to-End) TCP with link layer support as a function of key parameters such as terrestrial/satellite propagation delay, segment loss rate and buffer size. Our analysis is supported by simulations; throughput comparisons indicate superiority of TCP splitting over E2E scheme in most cases. However, in situations where end-to-end delay is dominated by terrestrial portion and buffering is very limited at intermediate node, E2E achieves higher throughput than TCP splitting.
