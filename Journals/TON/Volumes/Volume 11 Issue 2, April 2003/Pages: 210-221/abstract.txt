Distributed power-control algorithms for systems with hard signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) constraints may diverge when infeasibility arises. In this paper, we present a power-control framework called utility-based power control (UBPC) by reformulating the problem using a softened SIR requirement (utility) and adding a penalty on power consumption (cost). Under this framework, the goal is to maximize the net utility, defined as utility minus cost. Although UBPC is still noncooperative and distributed in nature, some degree of cooperation emerges: a user will automatically decrease its target SIR (and may even turn off transmission) when it senses that traffic congestion is building up. This framework enables us to improve system convergence and to satisfy heterogeneous service requirements (such as delay and bit error rate) for integrated networks with both voice users and data users. Fairness, adaptiveness, and a high degree of flexibility can be achieved by properly tuning parameters in UBPC.
