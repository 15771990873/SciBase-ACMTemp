We study the benefit of reconfigurability for wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) ring networks with dynamic single-hubbed traffic. We showthat the ability to reconfigure wavelength add-drop multiplexers helps to reduce the number of expensive line terminating equipment (LTEs) by a factor ofW, whereWis the number of wavelengths in the network. In addition, we show that for a general class of traffic, optical networks using reconfigurable wavelength add-drop multiplexers guarantee to be almost as bandwidth efficient as full wavelength add-drop networks, that is, opaque networks. For such traffic, we introduce several fast algorithms that achieve or approximate the optimal performance guarantees. The comparison between reconfigurable networks and opaque networks is quantified using a performance metric calledcapacity ratio, which captures the relative throughput performance of a reconfigurable network compared to the opaque network.
