Previous scalable on-demand streaming protocols do not allow clients to recover from packet loss. This paper develops new protocols that: 1) have a tunably short latency for the client to begin playing the media; 2) allow heterogeneous clients to recover lost packets without jitter as long as each client'scumulativeloss rate is within a tunable threshold; and 3) assume a tunable upper bound on the transmission rate to each client that can be as small as a fraction (e.g., 25%) greater than the media play rate. Models are developed to compute the minimum required server bandwidth for a given loss rate and playback latency. The results of the models are used to develop the new protocols and assess their performance. The new protocols, Reliable Periodic Broadcast and Reliable Bandwidth Skimming, are simple to implement and achieve nearly the best possible scalability and efficiency for a given set of client characteristics and desirable/feasible media quality. Furthermore, the results show that the new reliable protocols that transmit to each client at only twice the media play rate have similar performance to previous protocols that require clients to receive at many times the play rate.
