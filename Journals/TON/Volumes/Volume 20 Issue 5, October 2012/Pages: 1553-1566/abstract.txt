Node mobility and end-to-end disconnections in disruption-tolerant networks (DTNs) greatly impair the effectiveness of data forwarding. Although social-based approaches can address the problem, most existing solutions only focus on forwarding data to a single destination. In this paper, we study multicast with single and multiple data items in DTNs from a social network perspective, develop analytical models for multicast relay selection, and furthermore investigate the essential difference between multicast and unicast in DTNs. The proposed approach selects relays according to their capabilities, measured by social-based metrics, for forwarding data to the destinations. The design of social-based metrics exploits social network concepts such as node centrality and social community, and the selected relays ensure achieving the required data delivery ratio within the given time constraint. Extensive trace-driven simulations show that the proposed approach has similar data delivery ratio and delay to that of Epidemic routing, but significantly reduces data forwarding cost, measured by the number of relays used.
