In this paper, a new adaptive forward-error-correction scheme (AFEC) is introduced at the link layer for TCP/IP data traffic in wireless ATM networks. The fading and interference in wireless links cause high and variable error rates, as well as bursty errors. The purpose of the AFEC scheme is to provide a dynamic error-control mechanism by using the Reed-Solomon coding to protect the ATM cell payload, as well as the payload type indicator/cell loss priority fields in the ATM cell header. In order to enhance the error tolerance in cell framing and correct delivery, the AFEC scheme functions within a new concept called LANET framing and addressing protection mechanisms. The AFEC scheme has been validated using a simulation testbed of a low-speed wireless ATM network.
