We study jitter control in networks with guaranteed quality of service (QoS) from thecompetitive analysispoint of view: we propose on-line algorithms that control jitter and compare their performance to the best possible (by an off-line algorithm) for any given arrival sequence. Fordelay jitter, where the goal is to minimize the difference between delay times of different packets, we show that a simple on-line algorithm using a buffer ofBslots guarantees the same delay jitter as the best off-line algorithm using buffer spaceB/2. We prove that the guarantees made by our on-line algorithm hold, even for simple distributed implementations, where the total buffer space is distributed along the path of the connection, provided that the input stream satisfies a certain simple property. Forrate jitter, where the goal is to minimize the difference between inter-arrival times, we develop an on-line algorithm using a buffer of size 2B+hfor anyhâ‰¥ 1, and compare its jitter to the jitter of an optimal off-line algorithm using buffer sizeB. We prove that our algorithm guarantees that the difference is bounded by a term proportional toB/h.
