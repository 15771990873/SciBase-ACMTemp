Because signals carried by two waveguides entering a common switch element would generate crosstalk, a regularN×Nmultistage interconnection network (MIN) cannot be directly used as an optical switch betweenNinputs andNoutputs in an optical network. A simple solution is to use a 2N× 2Ncube-type MIN to provide theN×Nconnections, which needs a much larger hardware cost. A recent research proposed another solution, called the time-domain approach, that divides theNoptical inputs into several groups such that crosstalk-free connections can be provided by anN×Nregular MIN in several time slots, one for each group. Researchers studied this approach on Omega networks and defined the class set θ to be the set ofN-permutations realizable in two time slots on an Omega network. They proved that the size of θ is larger than the size of class Ω, where Ω consists of allN-permutations admissible to a regularN×N(nonoptical) Omega network. This paper first presents an optimalO(NlogN) time algorithm for identifying whether a given permutation belongs to class θ or not. Using this algorithm, this paper then proves an interesting result that the class θ is identical to the class Ω + 1 which represents the set ofN-permutations admissible to a nonopticalN×None-extra stage Omega network.
