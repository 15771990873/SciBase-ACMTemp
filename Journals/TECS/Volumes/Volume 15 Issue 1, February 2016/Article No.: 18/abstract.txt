QR decomposition (QRD), a matrix decomposition algorithm widely used in embedded application domain, can be realized in a large number of valid processing sequences that differ significantly in the number of memory accesses and computations, and hence the overall implementation energy. With modern low-power embedded processors evolving toward register files with wide memory interfaces and vector functional units (FUs), data flow in these algorithms needs to be carefully devised to efficiently utilize the costly wide memory accesses and the vector FUs. In this article, we present an energy-efficient data flow transformation strategy for the Givens rotation--based QRD.
