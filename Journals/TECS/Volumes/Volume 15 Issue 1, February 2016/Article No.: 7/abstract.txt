This article presents a survey of energy-aware scheduling algorithms proposed for real-time systems. The analysis presents the main results starting from the middle 1990s until today, showing how the proposed solutions evolved to address the evolution of the platform's features and needs. The survey first presents a taxonomy to classify the existing approaches for uniprocessor systems, distinguishing them according to the technology exploited for reducing energy consumption, that is,Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling(DVFS),Dynamic Power Management(DPM), or both. Then, the survey discusses the approaches proposed in the literature to deal with the additional problems related to the evolution of computing platforms toward multicore architectures.
