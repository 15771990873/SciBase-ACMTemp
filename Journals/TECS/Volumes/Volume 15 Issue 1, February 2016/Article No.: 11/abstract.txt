Current triple-level cell (TLC)-based solids-tate drives used in multimedia storage devices support multichannel access to increase capacity and throughput. Unfortunately, current state-of-the-art FTL algorithms must employ selective caching for inquiring about the address mapping information, which causes low space utilization, a large flash memory requirement, and performance degradation. In this article, the<u>Ca</u>che-<u>b</u>ased Flash Translation Layer (Cab-FTL) is proposed for TLC-based multimedia storage devices. Cab-FTL enhances the read and write performances by achieving high space utilization while reducing the size of the mapping tables to 1.68&percnt; compared to DFTL. Despite a caching of the mapping tables in DRAM, Cab-FTL achieves a fast system boot using its fast wake-up mechanism.
