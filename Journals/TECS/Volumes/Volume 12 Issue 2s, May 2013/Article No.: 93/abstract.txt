The domain ofinexactcircuit design, in which accuracy of the circuit can be exchanged for substantial cost (energy, delay, and/or area) savings, has been gathering increasing prominence of late owing to a growing desire for reducing energy consumption of the systems, particularly in the domain of embedded and (portable) multimedia applications. Most of the previous approaches to realizing inexact circuits relied on scaling of circuit parameters (such as supply voltage) taking advantage of an application’s error tolerance to achieve the cost and accuracy trade-offs, thus suffering from acute drawbacks of considerable implementation overheads that significantly reduced the gains. In this article, two novel design approaches calledProbabilistic PruningandProbabilistic Logic Minimizationare proposed to realize inexact circuits with zero hardware overhead.Extensive simulations on various architectures of critical datapath elements demonstrate that each of the techniques can independently achieve normalized gains as large as 2x--9.5x in energy-delay-area product for relative error magnitude as low as 10− 4&percnt;--8&percnt; compared to corresponding conventional correct circuits.
