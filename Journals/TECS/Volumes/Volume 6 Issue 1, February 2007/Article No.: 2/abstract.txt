The overhead of context switching limits efficient scheduling of multiple concurrent threads on a uniprocessor when real-time requirements exist. A software-implemented protocol controller may be crippled by this problem. The available idle time may be too short to recover through context switching, so only the primary thread can execute during message activity, slowing the secondary threads and potentially missing deadlines. Asynchronous software thread integration (ASTI) uses coroutine calls and integration, letting threads make independent progress efficiently, and reducing the needed context switches. We demonstrate the methods with a software implementation of an automotive communication protocol (J1850) and several secondary threads.
