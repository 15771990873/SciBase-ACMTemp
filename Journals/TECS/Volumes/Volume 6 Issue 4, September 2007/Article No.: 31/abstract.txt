Estimating the energy consumption of software in multiprocessor systems-on-chip (MPSoCs) is crucial for enabling quick evaluations of both software and hardware optimizations. However, high-level estimations should be applicable at software level, possibly constructing effective power models depending on parameters that can be extracted directly from the application characteristics. We propose a methodology for accurate analysis of power consumption of message-passing primitives in a MPSoC, and, in particular, an energy model which, in spite of its simplicity, allows to model the traffic-dependent nature of energy consumption through the use of a single, abstract parameter, namely, the size of the message exchanged.
