Advances in wireless technology have brought us closer to extensive deployment of distributed real-time embedded systems connected through a wireless channel. The medium-access control (MAC) layer protocol is critical in providing a real-time guarantee. We have devised a real-time wireless MAC protocol, robust implicit earliest deadline first, or RI-EDF. Packets are transmitted according to EDF scheduling rules, offering a protocol that implicitly avoids contention. In the event of a packet loss or a node failure, every node has the opportunity to recover the schedule based on a static recovery priority, offering a protocol that is robust with no central point of failure. We demonstrate in simulations that RI-EDF provides better goodput and lower packet loss than existing protocols like 802.11 PCF and EDCF. In our implementation and distributed control test-bed, we show that RI-EDF provides better throughput than the TinyOS MAC-layer protocol. Overall, RI-EDF provides predictable temporal behavior with minimal impact on node failures, packet losses, and noise in the channel.
