We present an energy-efficient, utility accrual, real-time scheduling algorithm called ReUA. ReUA considers an application model where activities are subject to time/utility function time constraints, mutual exclusion constraints on shared non-CPU resources, and statistical performance requirements on individual activity timeliness behavior. The algorithm targets mobile embedded systems wheresystem-levelenergy consumption is also a major concern. For such a model, we consider the scheduling objectives of (1) satisfying the statistical performance requirements and (2) maximizing the system-level energy efficiency, while respecting resource constraints. Since the problem is NP-hard, ReUA allocates CPU cycles using statistical properties of application cycle demands, and heuristically computes schedules with a polynomial time cost. We analytically establish several timeliness and nontimeliness properties of the algorithm. Further, our simulation experiments illustrate ReUA's effectiveness and superiority.
