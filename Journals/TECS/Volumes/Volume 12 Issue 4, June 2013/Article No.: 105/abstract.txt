We exploit the inherent information redundancy in the control path of Network-on-Chip (NoC) routers to manage transient errors, preventing packet loss and misrouting. Outputs of the routing arbitration units in NoC routers can be used to determine arbitration failures, because the valid arbitration outputs are a subset of all possible values. This feature is exploited to detect and correct logic and register errors in the router arbitration control path. The proposed method is complementary to other error management methods for NoC routers. An analytical reliability model of our method is provided, including parameters such as logic unit size, different error rates for logic gates and registers, and the location of faulty elements. Compared to triple-modular redundancy (TMR), the proposed method improves the arbiter reliability by two orders of magnitude while reducing the total area and power by 43&percnt; and 64&percnt;, respectively. In the presented case studies, two traffic traces from the PARSEC benchmark suite are used to evaluate the average latency and energy consumption. Simulations performed on a 4Ã— 4 NoC show that our method reduces the average latency by up to 50&percnt; and reduces average energy by up to 70&percnt; compared to other methods.
