At the core of an efficient chip multiprocessors (CMP) is support for unicast and multicast routing, low implementation costs, and the ability to isolate concurrent applications with maximum utilization of the CMP. We present an efficient logic-based unicast and multicast routing algorithm that guarantees isolation of local application traffic within any near-convex region on the chip, and the algorithms to recognize supported partitions and configure the cores accordingly. Evaluations show that the routing algorithm has a 57&percent; more compact implementation than a recent multicast solution with the same coverage, and it achieves 5&percent; higher throughput with 13&percent; lower latency.
