An unsupervised learning algorithm is presented for segmentation and evaluation of motion data from the on-body Orient wireless motion capture system for mobile gait analysis. The algorithm ismodel-freeand operates on thelatent spaceof the motion, by firstaggregatingall the sensor data into a single vector, and then modeling them on a low-dimensional manifold to perform segmentation. The proposed approach is contrasted to abasic, model-basedalgorithm, which operates directly on the joint angles computed by the Orient sensor devices. The latent space algorithm is shown to be capable of retrieving qualitative features of the motion even in the face of noisy or incomplete sensor readings.
