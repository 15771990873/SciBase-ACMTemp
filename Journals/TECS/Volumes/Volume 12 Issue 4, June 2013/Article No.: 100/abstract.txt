In emergency medicine, patient care is intense and stressful, often requiring paramedics to consult with remote physicians to convey the patient's condition. We present a framework for context-management in telemedicine developed in collaboration between engineers, physicians, and paramedics. We describe a mobile platform and embedded wireless sensors to capture physiological and audio context into a comprehensive patient record, accessible locally and remotely. We describe a first evaluation of this technology by trained paramedics in simulated scenarios and evaluate key aspects of system performance. Early results suggest that wireless sensing can provide reliable and low latency data both locally and to remote physicians. In addition, audio context capture is a promising approach to capturing a comprehensive patient record, with a low rate of medically important errors.
