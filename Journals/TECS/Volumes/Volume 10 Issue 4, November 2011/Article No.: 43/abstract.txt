Inexpensive, reliable hard disk storage is increasingly required in both businesses and the home. As disk capacities increase and multiple drives are combined in one system the probability of multiple disk failures increases. Through the adoption of RAID 6 the capability to recover from up to two simultaneous disk failures becomes available. In this article, we present three different RAID 6 implementations each tailored to support different target applications and optimized to reduce overall hardware resource utilization. We present an optimal Reed-Solomon-based RAID 6 implementation for arrays of four disks. We also present the smallest in terms of hardware resource utilization as well having the highest throughput RAID 6 hardware solution for disk arrays of up to 15 drives. Finally, we present an implementation supporting up to 255 disks in a single array.
