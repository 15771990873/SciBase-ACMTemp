As mobile computing is getting popular, there is a growing need for techniques that minimize energy consumption on battery-powered mobile devices. Processor voltage scheduling can effectively reduce processor energy consumption by lowering the processor speed. In this paper, we study voltage scheduling for real-time periodic tasks with non-preemptible sections. Three schemes are proposed: The static speed algorithm derives the minimum static feasible speed based on the stack resource policy. Due to blocking, this static speed is usually higher than the speed required for scheduling fully preemptible tasks (called the utilization speed). Two dynamic speed algorithms are then introduced to further reduce energy consumption. The novel dual speed algorithm operates the processor at the utilization speed whenever possible and switches to the higher static speed only when blocking occurs. The dual speed dynamic reclaiming algorithm reserves time budget for each job, reclaims the unused time budget from completed jobs and redistributes it to subsequent jobs so they can run at a lower speed whenever possible. Feasibility conditions for real-time task sets have been derived and proved mathematically. Simulation results show that the proposed voltage scheduling algorithms dramatically reduce processor energy consumption over non-power-aware scheduling algorithms. Furthermore, the two dynamic speed algorithms consistently outperform the static speed scheme in a wide range of system and workload conditions.
