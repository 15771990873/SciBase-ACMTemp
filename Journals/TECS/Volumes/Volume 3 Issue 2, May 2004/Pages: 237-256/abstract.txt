Reconfiguration delay is one of the major barriers in the way of dynamically adapting a system to its application requirements. The run-time reconfiguration delay is quite comparable to the application latency for many classes of applications and might even dominate the application run-time. In this paper, we present an efficient optimal algorithm for minimizing the run-time reconfiguration (context switching) delay of executing an application on a dynamically adaptable system. The system is composed of a number of cameras with embedded reconfigurable resources collaborating in order to track an object. The operations required to execute in order to track the object are revealed to the system at run-time and can change according to a number of parameters, such as the target shape and proximity. Similarly, we can assume that the applications comprising tasks are already scheduled and each of them has to be realized on the reconfigurable fabric in order to be executed.The modeling and the algorithm are both applicable to partially reconfigurable platforms as well as multi-FPGA systems. The algorithm can be directly applied to minimize the application run-time for the typical classes of applications, where the actual execution delay of the basic operations is negligible compared to the reconfiguration delay. We prove the optimality and the efficiency of our algorithm. We report the experimental results, which demonstrate a 2.5--40&percnt; improvement on the total run-time reconfiguration delay as compared to other heuristics.
