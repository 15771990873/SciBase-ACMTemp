Verification is one of the most complex and expensive tasks in the current Systems-on-Chip design process. Many existing approaches employ a bottom-up approach to pipeline validation, where the functionality of an existing pipelined processor is, in essence, reverse-engineered from its RT-level implementation. Our validation technique is complementary to these bottom-up approaches. Our approach leverages the system architect's knowledge about the behavior of the pipelined architecture, through architecture description language (ADL) constructs, and thus allows a powerful top-down approach to pipeline validation. The most important requirement in top-down validation process is to ensure that the specification (reference model) is golden. This paper addresses automatic validation of processor, memory, and coprocessor pipelines described in an ADL. We present a graph-based modeling that captures both structure and behavior of the architecture. Based on this model, we present algorithms to ensure that the static behavior of the pipeline is well formed by analyzing the structural aspects of the specification. We applied our methodology to verify specification of several realistic architectures from different architectural domains to demonstrate the usefulness of our approach.
