Resource-limited mobile embedded systems can benefit greatly from dynamic adaptation of system parameters. We propose a novel approach that employs iterative tuning using lightweight formal verification at runtime with feedback for dynamic adaptation. One objective of this approach is to enable trade-off analysis across multiple layers (e.g., application, middleware, OS) and predict the possible property violations as the system evolves dynamically over time. Specifically, an executable formal specification is developed for each layer of the mobile system under consideration. The formal specification is then analyzed using statistical property checking and statistical quantitative analysis, to determine the impact of various resource management policies for achieving desired timing/QoS properties. Integration of formal analysis with dynamic behavior from system execution results in a feedback loop that enables model refinement and further optimization of policies and parameters. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach to the adaptive provisioning of resource-limited distributed real-time systems using a mobile multimedia case study.
