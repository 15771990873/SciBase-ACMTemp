Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) require a high degree of reliability and robustness. Hence it is important to assert their correctness with respect to extra-functional properties, like power consumption, temperature, etc. In turn the physical quantities may be exploited for assessing system implementations. This article develops a methodology for utilizing measurements of physical quantities for testing the conformance of a running CPS with respect to a formal description of its required behavior allowing to uncover defects. We present foundations and implementations of this approach and demonstrate its usefulness by conformance testing power measurements of a wireless sensor node with a formal model of its power consumption.
