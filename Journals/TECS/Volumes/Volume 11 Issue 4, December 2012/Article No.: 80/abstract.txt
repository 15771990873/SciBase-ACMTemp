Many Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are composed of low-cost devices that are deeply integrated with physical environments. As a result, the performance of a CPS system is inevitably undermined by variousphysical uncertainties, which include stochastic noises, hardware biases, unpredictable environment changes, and dynamics of the physical process of interest. Traditional solutions to these issues (e.g., device calibration and collaborative signal processing) work in an open-loop fashion and hence often fail to adapt to the uncertainties after system deployment. In this article, we propose anadaptivesystem-level calibration approach for a class of CPS systems whose primary objective is to detect events or targets of interest. Through collaborative data fusion, our calibration approach features a feedback control loop that exploits system heterogeneity to mitigate the impact of aforementioned uncertainties on the system performance. In contrast to existing heuristic-based solutions, our control-theoretical calibration algorithm can ensure provable system stability and convergence. We also develop a routing algorithm for fusion-based multihop CPS systems that is robust to communication unreliability and delay. Our approach is evaluated by both experiments on a testbed of Tmotes as well as extensive simulations based on data traces gathered from a real vehicle detection experiment. The results demonstrate that our calibration algorithm enables a CPS system to maintain the optimal sensing performance in the presence of various system and environmental dynamics.
