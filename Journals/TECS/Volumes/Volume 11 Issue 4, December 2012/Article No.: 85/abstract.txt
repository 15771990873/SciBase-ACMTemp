The complexity and physical distribution of modern active safety, chassis, and powertrain automotive applications requires the use of distributed architectures. Complex functions designed as networks of function blocks exchanging signal information are deployed onto the physical HW and implemented in a SW architecture consisting of a set of tasks and messages. The typical configuration features priority-based scheduling of tasks and messages and imposes end-to-end deadlines. In this work, we present and compare formulations and procedures for the optimization of the task allocation, the signal to message mapping, and the assignment of priorities to tasks and messages in order to meet end-to-end deadline constraints and minimize latencies. Our formulations leverage worst-case response time analysis within a mixed integer linear optimization framework and are compared for performance against a simulated annealing implementation. The methods are applied for evaluation to an automotive case study of complexity comparable to industrial design problems.
