Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are large, distributed embedded systems integrated with various sensors and actuators. CPS are rapidly emerging as an important computing paradigm in many modern applications. Developing CPS applications is currently challenging due to the sheer complexity of the related functionality as well as the broad set of constraints and unknowns that must be tackled during operation. This article presents a novel high-level programming model and the supporting optimization and middleware routines for executing applications on physically-distributed networks of reconfigurable embedded systems. The proposed model describes the optimization goals, sensing inputs, actuation outputs, events, and constraints of an application, while leaving to the compiler and execution environment the task of optimally implementing the derived functionality. Experimental results discuss the additional performance optimizations enabled by the proposed model, and the timing and power consumption of the middleware routines, and present a temperature monitoring application implemented on a network of reconfigurable, embedded processors.
