The integration of physical systems through computing and networking has become pervasive, a trend now known as cyber-physical systems (CPS). Functionality in CPS emerges from the interaction of networked computational and physical objects. System design and integration are particularly challenging because fundamentally different physical and computational design concerns intersect. The impact of these interactions is the loss of compositionality which creates tremendous challenges. The key idea in this article is to use passivity for decoupling the control design of networked systems from uncertainties such as time delays and packet loss, thus providing a fundamental simplification strategy that limits the complexity of interactions. The main contribution is the application of the approach to an experimental case study of a networked multi-robot system. We present a networked control architecture that ensures the overall system remains stable in spite of implementation uncertainties such as network delays and data dropouts, focusing on the technical details required for the implementation. We describe a prototype domain-specific modeling language and automated code generation tools for the design of networked control systems on top of passivity that facilitate effective system configuration, deployment, and testing. Finally, we present experimental evaluation results that show decoupling of interlayer interactions.
