This article describes a reliable gateway for in-vehicle networks. Such networks include local interconnect networks, controller area networks, and FlexRay. There is some latency when transferring a message from one node (source) to another node (destination). A high probability of error exists due to different protocol specifications such as baud-rate, and message frame format. Therefore, deploying a reliable gateway is a challenge to the automotive industry. We propose a reliable gateway based on the OSEK/VDX components for in-vehicle networks. We also examine the gateway system developed, and then we evaluate the performance of our proposed system.
