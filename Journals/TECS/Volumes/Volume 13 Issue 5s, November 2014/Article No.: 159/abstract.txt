Consider the problem of assigning implicit-deadline sporadic tasks on a heterogeneous multiprocessor platform comprising a constant number (denoted byt) of distinct types of processors—such a platform is referred to as at-type platform. We present two algorithms, LPGIMand LPGNM, each providing the following guarantee. For a given t-type platform and a task set,ifthere exists a task assignment such that tasks can be scheduled to meet their deadlines by allowing them to migrate only between processors of the same type (intra-migrative),then: (i) LPGIMsucceeds in finding such an assignment where the same restriction on task migration applies (intra-migrative) but given a platform in whichonly one processor of each typeis 1 &plus; α ×t-1/ttimes faster and (ii) LPGNMsucceeds in finding a task assignment where tasks are not allowed to migrate between processors (non-migrative) but given a platform in whichevery processoris 1 &plus; α times faster. The parameter α is a property of the task set; it is the maximum of all the task utilizations that are no greater than one. To the best of our knowledge, for t-type heterogeneous multiprocessors: (i) for the problem of intra-migrative task assignment, no previous algorithm exists with a proven bound and hence our algorithm, LPGIM, is the first of its kind and (ii) for the problem of non-migrative task assignment, our algorithm, LPGNM, has superior performance compared to state-of-the-art.
