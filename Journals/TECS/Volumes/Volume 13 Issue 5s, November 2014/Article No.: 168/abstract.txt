In the embedded system domain there is a continuous demand towards providing higher flexibility for application development. This trend strives for virtual prototyping solutions capable of performing fast system simulation. Among other benefits, such a solution supports concurrent hardware/software system design by enabling to start developing, testing, and validating the embedded software substantially earlier than has been possible in the past. Towards this direction, throughout this article we introduce a new framework, named Plug&Chip;, targeting to support rapid prototyping of 2D and 3D digital systems. In contrast to other relevant approaches, our solution provides higher flexibility by enabling incremental system design, while also handling platforms developed with the usage of 3D integration technology.
