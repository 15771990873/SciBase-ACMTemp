In recent years, advances in virtualization technology have enabled multiple virtual machines to run on a physical machine, such that each virtual machine can perform independently with its own operating system. The IT industry has adopted virtualization technology because of its ability to improve hardware resource utilization, achieve low-power consumption, support concurrent applications, simplify device management, and reduce maintenance costs. However, because of the hardware limitation of storage devices, the I/O capacity could cause performance bottlenecks. To address the problem, we propose a hybrid storage access framework that exploits solid-state drives (SSDs) to improve the I/O performance in a virtualization environment.
