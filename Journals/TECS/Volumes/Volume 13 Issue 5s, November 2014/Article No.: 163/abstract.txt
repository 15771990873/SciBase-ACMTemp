Timely and efficient data dissemination is one of the fundamental requirements to enable innovative applications in vehicular cyber-physical systems (VCPS). In this work, we intensively analyze the characteristics of temporal data dissemination in VCPS. On this basis, we formulate the static and dynamic snapshot consistency requirements on serving real-time requests for temporal data items. Two online algorithms are proposed to enhance the system performance with different requirements. In particular, a reschedule mechanism is developed to make the scheduling adaptable to the dynamic snapshot consistency requirement. A comprehensive performance evaluation demonstrates the superiority of the proposed algorithms.
