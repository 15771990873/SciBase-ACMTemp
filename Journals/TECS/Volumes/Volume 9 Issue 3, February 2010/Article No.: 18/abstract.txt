In this article, we study optimization of a RapidIO network and FPGA-based computation engines to address the taxing requirements of a set of real-time Ground-Moving Target Indicators (GMTI) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) kernels for Space-Based Radar (SBR). By employing a RapidIO hardware testbed and validated simulation, we determine key trade-offs in design of reconfigurable systems for GMTI and SAR in terms of processing, memory, and network throughput. In addition, we study considerations for timely delivery of latency-sensitive control traffic present in many satellite applications. Based on our results, we propose architectural modifications to further improve performance of SBR systems.
