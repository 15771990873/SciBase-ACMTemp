Hierarchical agent framework is proposed to construct a monitoring layer towards self-aware parallel systems-on-chip (SoCs). With monitoring services as a new design dimension, systems are capable of observing and reconfiguring themselves dynamically at all levels of granularity, based on application requirements and platform conditions. Agents with hierarchical priorities work adaptively and cooperatively to maintain and improve system performance in the presence of variations and faults. Function partitioning of agents and hierarchical monitoring operations on parallel SoCs are analyzed. Applying the design approach on the Network-on-Chip (NoC) platform demonstrates the design process and benefits using the novel approach.
