Energy conservation has become a critical problem for real-time embedded storage systems. Although a variety of approaches for reducing energy consumption have been extensively studied, energy conservation for real-time embedded storage systems is still an open problem. In this article, we propose an energy management strategy, I/O Burstiness for Energy Conservation (IBEC), exploiting the burstiness of real-time embedded storage systems applications. Our approach aims at combining the IBEC energy-management strategy with a Linux-based disk block-scheduling mechanism to conserve the energy of storage systems. Extensive experiments are conducted involving a number of synthetic disk traces as well as real-world data-intensive traces. To evaluate the energy efficiency of IBEC, we compare the performance of IBEC against three existing strategies, namely, PA-EDF, DP-EDF, and EDF. Compared with the alternative strategies, IBEC reduces the power consumption of real-time embedded disks system by up to 60&percnt;.
