Soft errors induced by terrestrial radiation are becoming a significant concern in architectures designed in newer technologies. If left undetected, these errors can result in catastrophic consequences or costly maintenance problems in different embedded applications. In this article, we focus on utilizing the compiler's help in duplicating instructions for error detection in VLIW datapaths. The instruction duplication mechanism is further supported by a hardware enhancement for efficient result verification, which avoids the need of additional comparison instructions. In the proposed approach, the compiler determines the instruction schedule by balancing the permissible performance degradation and the energy constraint with the required degree of duplication. Our experimental results show that our algorithms allow the designer to perform trade-off analysis between performance, reliability, and energy consumption.
