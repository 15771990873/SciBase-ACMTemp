Modern network-on-chip (NoC) systems are required to handle complex runtime traffic patterns and unprecedented applications. Data traffics of these applications are difficult to fully comprehend at design time so as to optimize the network design. However, it has been discovered that the majority of dataflows in a network are dominated by less than 10&percnt; of the specific pathways. In this article, we introduce a method that is capable of identifying critical pathways in a network at runtime and can then dynamically reconfigure the network to optimize for network performance subject to the identified dominated flows. An online learning and analysis scheme is employed to quickly discover the emerging dominated traffic flows and provides a statistical traffic prediction using regression analysis. The architecture of a self-tuning network is also discussed which can be reconfigured by setting up the identified point-to-point paths for the dominance dataflows in large traffic volumes. The merits of this new approach are experimentally demonstrated using comprehensive NoC simulations. Compared to the conventional network architectures over a range of realistic applications, the proposed self-tuning network approach can effectively reduce the latency and power consumption by as much as 25&percnt; and 24&percnt;, respectively. We also evaluated the configuration time and additional hardware cost. This new approach demonstrates the capability of an adaptive NoC to handle more complex and dynamic applications.
