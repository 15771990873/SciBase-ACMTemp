We propose a secure platform on a chip multiprocessor, FIDES, in order to enable next generation mobile terminals to execute downloaded native applications for Linux. Its most important feature is the higher security based on multigrained separation mechanisms. Four new technologies support the FIDES platform: bus filter logic, XIP kernels, policy separation, and dynamic access control. With these technologies, the FIDES platform can tolerate both application-level and kernel-level bugs on an actual download subsystem. Thus, the best-suited platform to secure next generation mobile terminals is FIDES.
