Time predictability is one of the most important design considerations for real-time systems. In this article, we study the impact of instruction prefetching on the worst-case performance of instruction caches. We extend the static cache simulation technique to model and compute the worst-case instruction cache performance with prefetching. The evaluation results show that instruction prefetching can benefit both the average-case and worst-case performance; however, the degree of the worst-case performance improvement due to instruction prefetching is less than that of the average-case performance. As a result, the time variation of computing is increased by instruction prefetching. Also, our experimental results indicate that the prefetching distance can significantly impact the worst-case performance of instruction caches with instruction prefetching. Specifically, when the prefetching distance is equal to the L1 miss penalty, the worst-case execution time with instruction prefetching is minimized.
