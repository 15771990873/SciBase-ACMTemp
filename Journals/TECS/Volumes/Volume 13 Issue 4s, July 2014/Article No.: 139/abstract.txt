The substantial silicon density in 3D VLSI, albeit its numerous advantages, introduces serious thermal threats that would lead to faults and system failures. This article introduces a new strategy to effectively diffuse heat from NoC-based 3D CMPs. Runtime Dynamic Programming Network (DPN) is proposed to optimize routing directions and provide silicon temperature moderation. Both on-chip reliability and computational performance have been improved by 63&percnt; and 27&percnt;, respectively, with the DPN approach. This work enables a new avenue to explore the adaptability for future large-scale 3D integration.
