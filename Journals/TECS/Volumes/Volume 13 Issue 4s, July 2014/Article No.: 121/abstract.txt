MultiNets is a system supporting seamless switch-over between wireless interfaces on mobile devices in real-time. MultiNets is configurable to run in three different modes: (i)Energy Saving mode--for choosing the interface that saves the most energy based on the condition of the device, (ii)Offload mode--for offloading data traffic from the cellular to WiFi network, and (iii)Performance mode--for selecting the network for the fastest data connectivity. MultiNets also provides a powerful API that gives the application developers: (i) the choice to select a network interface to communicate with a specific server, and (ii) the ability to simultaneously transfer data over multiple network interfaces. MultiNets is modular, easily integrable, lightweight, and applicable to various mobile operating systems. We implement MultiNets on Android devices as a show case. MultiNets does not require any extra support from the network infrastructure and runs existing applications transparently.To evaluate MultiNets, we first collect data traces from 13 actual Android smartphone users over three months. We then use the collected traces to show that, by automatically switching to WiFi whenever it is available, MultiNets can offload on average 79.82&percnt; of the data traffic. We also illustrate that, by optimally switching between the interfaces, MultiNets can save on average 21.14 KJ of energy per day, which is equivalent to 27.4&percnt; of the daily energy usage. Using our API, we demonstrate that a video streaming application achieves 43--271&percnt; higher streaming rate when concurrently using WiFi and 3G interfaces. We deploy MultiNets in a real-world scenario and our experimental results show that depending on the user requirements, it outperforms the state-of-the-art Android system either by saving up to 33.75&percnt; energy, achieving near-optimal offloading, or achieving near-optimal throughput while substantially reducing TCP interruptions due to switching.
