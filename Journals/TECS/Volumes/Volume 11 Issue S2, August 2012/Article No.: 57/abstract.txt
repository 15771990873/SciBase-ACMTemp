A distributed cyber-physical system (DCPS) may receive and induce energy-based interference to and from its environment. This article presents a model and an associated methodology that can be used to (i) schedule tasks in DCPSs to ensure that the thermal effects of the task execution are within acceptable levels, and (ii) verify that a given schedule meets the constraints. The model uses coarse discretization of space and linearity of interference. The methodology involves characterizing the interference of the task execution and fitting it into the model, then using the fitted model to verify a solution or explore the solution space.
