Reconfigurable computing (RC) is emerging as a promising area for embedded computing, in which complex systems must balance performance, flexibility, cost, and power. The difficulty associated with RC development suggests improved strategic planning and analysis techniques can save significant development time and effort. This article presents a new abstract modeling language and environment, the RC Modeling Language (RCML), to facilitate efficient design space exploration of RC systems at the estimation modeling level, that is, before building a functional implementation. Two integrated analysis tools and case studies, one analytical and one simulative, are presented illustrating relatively accurate automated analysis of systems modeled in RCML.
