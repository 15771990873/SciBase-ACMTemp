In this article, the RapidRadio framework for signal classification and receiver deployment is discussed. The framework is a productivity-enhancing tool that reduces the required knowledge base for implementing a receiver on an FPGA-based SDR platform. The ultimate objective of this framework is to identify unknown signals and to build FPGA-based receivers capable of receiving them. RapidRadio divides the process of radio creation into two phases; the analysis phase and radio synthesis phase. The analysis phase guides the user through the process of classifying an unknown signal and determining its modulation scheme and parameters, resulting in a radio receiver model. In the second phase, this model is transformed into a functional receiver in an FPGA-based platform.
