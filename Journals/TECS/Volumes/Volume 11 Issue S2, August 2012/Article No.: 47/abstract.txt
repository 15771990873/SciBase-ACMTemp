Advancement in technology has led to the deployment of body sensor networks (BSN) to monitor and sense human activity in pervasive environments. Using multiple wireless on-body systems, such as physiological data monitoring and motion capture systems, body sensor network data consists of heterogeneous physiologic and motoric streams that form a multidimensional framework. In this article, we analyze such high-dimensional body sensor network data by proposing an efficient, multidimensional factor analysis technique for quantifying human performance and, at the same time, providing visualization for performances of participants in a low-dimensional space for easier interpretation.
