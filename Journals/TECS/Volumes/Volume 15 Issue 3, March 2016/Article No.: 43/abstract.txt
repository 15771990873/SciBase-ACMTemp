The recent advent of many-accelerator systems-on-chip (SoC), driven by the need for maximizing throughput and power efficiency, has led to an exponential increase in the hardware/software co-design complexity. The reason of this increase is that the designer has to explore a vast number of architectural parameter combinations for each single accelerator, as well as inter-accelerator configuration combinations under specific area, throughput, and power constraints, given that each accelerator has different computational requirements. In such a case, the design space size explodes. Thus, existing design space exploration (DSE) techniques give poor-quality solutions, as the design space cannot be adequately covered in a fair time. This problem is aggravated by the very long simulation time of the many-accelerator virtual platforms (VPs). This article addresses these design issues by (a) presenting a virtual prototyping solution that decreases the exploration time by enabling the evaluation of multiple configurations per VP simulation and (b) proposing a DSE methodology that efficiently explores the design space of many-accelerator systems. With the use of two fully developed use cases, namely an H.264 decoding server for multiple video streams and a parallelized denoising system for MRI scans, we show that the proposed DSE methodology either leads to Pareto points that dominate over those of a typical DSE scenario or finds new solutions that might not be found by the typical DSE. In addition, the proposed virtual prototyping solution leads to DSE runtime reduction reaching 10 × for H.264 and 5 × for Rician denoise.
