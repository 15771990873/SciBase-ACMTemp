We present a method of translating discrete-time Simulink models to Lustre programs. Our method consists of three steps: type inference, clock inference, and hierarchical bottom-up translation. In the process, we explain and formalize the typing and timing mechanisms of Simulink. The method has been implemented in a prototype tool called S2L, which has been used in the context of a European research project to translate two automotive controller models provided by Audi.
