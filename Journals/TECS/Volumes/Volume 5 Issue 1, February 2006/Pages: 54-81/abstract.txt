This paper addresses the interrelation between control and data flow in embedded system models through a new design representation, called Dual Flow Net (DFN). A modeling formalism with a very close-fitting control and data flow is achieved by this representation, as a consequence of enhancing its underlying Petri net structure. The work presented in this paper does not only tackle the modeling side in embedded systems design, but also the validation of embedded system models through formal methods. Various introductory examples illustrate the applicability of the DFN principles, whereas the capability of the model to with complex designs is demonstrated through the design and verification of a real-life Ethernet coprocessor.
