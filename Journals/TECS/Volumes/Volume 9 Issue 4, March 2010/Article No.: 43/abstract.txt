In this article, we present Microsearch, a search system suitable for embedded devices used in ubiquitous computing environments. Akin to a desktop search engine, Microsearch indexes the information inside a small device, and accurately resolves a user's queries. Given the limited hardware, conventional search engine design and algorithms cannot be used. We adopt Information Retrieval (IR) techniques for query resolution, and proposed a new space-efficient top-kquery resolution algorithm. A theoretical model of Microsearch is given to better understand the trade-offs in design parameters. Evaluation is done via actual implementation on off-the-shelf hardware.
