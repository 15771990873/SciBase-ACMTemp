The new-found ubiquity of embedded processors in consumer and industrial applications brings with it an intensified focus on security, as a strong level of trust in the system software is crucial to their widespread deployment. The growing area ofsoftware protectionattempts to address the key steps used by hackers in attacking a software system. In this paper, we introduce a unique approach to embedded software protection that utilizes a hardware/software codesign methodology. Results demonstrate that this framework can be the successful basis for the development of embedded applications that meet a wide range of security and performance requirements.
