We present an approach to frame packing for multicluster distributed embedded systems consisting of time-triggered and event-triggered clusters, interconnected via gateways. In our approach, the application messages are packed into frames such that the application is schedulable, thus the end-to-end message communication constraints are satisfied. We have proposed a schedulability analysis for applications consisting of mixed event-triggered and time-triggered processes and messages, and a worst-case queuing delay analysis for the gateways, responsible for routing inter-cluster traffic. Optimization heuristics for frame packing aiming at producing a schedulable system have been proposed. Extensive experiments and a real-life example show the efficiency of our frame-packing approach.
