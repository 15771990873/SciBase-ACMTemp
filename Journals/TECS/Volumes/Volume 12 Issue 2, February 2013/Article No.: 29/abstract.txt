The concept of smart homes (SH) has been extensively popularized, and there are a lot of technologies that need to be continuously utilized and integrated in such a concept. In this article, some applied problems of camera array (CA) in the SH are discussed and solved. Determining how to build an effective management method for CA in order to ensure that user privacy is not encroached upon is an important issue. In SH, the applications of CA are very diversified. We suggest that a satisfactory management method of CA should be based on the open service gateway initiative (OSGi) that includes resource management and monitoring (RMM) and UPnP security for the problems of resources and privacy, respectively. Finally, an applied example of CA is addressed in an elder-care center (EC). Simulation results show that the management strategy and application of CA based on an OSGi is satisfactory.
