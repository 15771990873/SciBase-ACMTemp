In this article, a single-pointer structure is proposed for the convolutional deinterleavers of mobile TV receivers. To enhance the burst-error correcting capability, the convolutional interleaving and deinterleaving scheme is widely used in mobile TV receivers. However, a convolutional deinterleaver requires many pointer registers. This article introduces a single-pointer structure that reduces the number of pointer registers. Experimental results show that the single-pointer structure reduces the area of the convolutional deinterleaver by 70&percnt; in a mobile TV receiver.
