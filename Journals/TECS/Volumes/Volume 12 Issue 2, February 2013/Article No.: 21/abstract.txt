Multimedia hiding system is to embed message behind the specified media, but it is still kept normal in media representations via human sensitive organizations without causing imperceptibility. In this article, we propose a data hiding system by means of flexible exploiting modification directions to achieve safer message concealments in image-media. In our scheme,ncover-pixels are flexibly chosen on modulo operations to embed a secrets, wheren= ⌈ log3(s) ⌉. The varied pixel values associated with the chosennpixels are only changed among [-1, 1]. Because the numbers of adjustable pixels are much greater than the pixels in the past scheme, our scheme is able to obtain a higher embedded ratio in response to the capacity requirements of information hiding systems. In addition, we also applied the statistics-steganalyzers to demonstrate that our scheme has accomplishment not only higher capacity but also kept the robustness against the blind steganalyzers.
