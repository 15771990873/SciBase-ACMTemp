Chip multiprocessor (CMP) techniques have been implemented in embedded systems due to tremendous computation requirements. Three-dimension (3D) CMP architecture has been studied recently for integrating more functionalities and providing higher performance. The high temperature on chip is a critical issue for the 3D architecture. In this article, we propose an online thermal prediction model for 3D chips. Using this model, we propose novel task scheduling algorithms based on rotation scheduling to reduce the peak temperature on chip. We consider data dependencies, especially inter-iteration dependencies that are not well considered in most of the current thermal-aware task scheduling algorithms. Our simulation results show that our algorithms can efficiently reduce the peak temperature up to 8.1Ë†C.
