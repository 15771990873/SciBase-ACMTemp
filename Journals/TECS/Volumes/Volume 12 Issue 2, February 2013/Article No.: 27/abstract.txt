Recent development of high-speed wireless networks and embedded systems has enabled the recording and delivery of high-performance multimedia to heterogeneous mobile users. To support heterogeneous mobile users with high-quality multimedia services, scalable video coding was introduced. In the scalable video coding (SVC), through multidimensional scalability, all types of these scalability can be exploited at the same time. However, the generated video sequences of scalable video coding are not adequate for mobile multimedia service systems since its flexibility makes non contiguous storing and retrieval of partial stream data. In this article, we propose efficient scalable video data reorganization for video servicing systems, which consist of video server and mobile clients. For video server, we reorganize scalable video streams taking into account both of decoding dependency and location in disk array storage, where disk array is widely used for storage systems of video server. In the mobile devices, we place substreams with the consideration of NAND flash memory page and block boundaries, which is storage for mobile devices. The experimental results show that the proposed reorganization of scalable video can improve the performance of mobile multimedia service systems.
