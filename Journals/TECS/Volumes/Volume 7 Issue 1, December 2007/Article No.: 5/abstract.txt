This paper reports on our experience with the implementation of the Real-time Specification for Java on the Ovm open source Java virtual machine. We describe the architecture and main design decisions involved in implementing real-time Java on Ovm. We present the first use of Real-time Java in avionics in the context of control software for a ScanEagle Unmanned Aerial Vehicle.
