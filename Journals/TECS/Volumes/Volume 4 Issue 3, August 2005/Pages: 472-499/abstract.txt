Embedded systems have been a traditional area of strength in the research agenda of the University of California at Berkeley. In parallel to this effort, a pattern of graduate and undergraduate classes has emerged that is the result of a distillation process of the research results. In this paper, we present the considerations that are driving our curriculum development and we review our undergraduate and graduate program. In particular, we describe in detail a graduate class (EECS249: Design of Embedded Systems: Modeling, Validation and Synthesis) that has been taught for six years. A common feature of our education agenda is the search for fundamentals of embedded systemsciencerather than embedded system design techniques, an approach that today is rather unique.
