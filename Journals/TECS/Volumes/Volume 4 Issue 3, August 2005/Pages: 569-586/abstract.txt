The paper presents a curriculum for a 4-year undergraduate program in Embedded System Engineering (ESE). The curriculum was developed using a two-step approach. First, a body of education knowledge for Embedded System Engineering was defined. The body consists of sixteen knowledge areas. Each area is composed of several knowledge units, some designated as core and others as electives. The minimum lecture time for the core of each knowledge area is identified. The Body of Knowledge for Computer Engineering, developed by the IEEE-CS/ACM task force for Computing Curricula, was used as a reference. The education knowledge for ESE then served as the base for the development of the program curriculum. The curriculum has a strong mathematics and basic science base, an in-depth exposure to engineering science and design of systems implemented with digital hardware and software, and coverage of two prominent application areas of embedded systems. The curriculum core takes approximately 3 years of the program; the remaining part is elective.
