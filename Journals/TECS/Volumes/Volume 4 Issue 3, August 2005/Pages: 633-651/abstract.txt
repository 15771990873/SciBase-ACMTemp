This paper provides an analysis of embedded systems education using a didactic approach. Didactics is a field of educational studies mostly referring to research aimed at investigating what's unique with a particular subject and how this subject ought to be taught. From the analysis we conclude that embedded systems has a thematic identity and a functional legitimacy. This implies that the subject would benefit from being taught with an exemplifying selection and using an interactive communication, meaning that the education should move from teaching “something of everything” toward “everything of something.” The interactive communication aims at adapting the education toward the individual student, which is feasible if using educational methods inspired by project-organized and problem-based learning. This educational setting is also advantageous as it prepares the students for a future career as embedded system engineers. The conclusions drawn from the analysis correlate with our own experiences from education in mechatronics as well as with a recently published study of 21 companies in Sweden dealing with industrial software engineering.
