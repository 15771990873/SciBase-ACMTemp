In this article, two digit-serial architectures for normal basis multipliers over (GF(2m)) are presented. These two structures have the same gate count and gate delay. We also consider two special cases of optimal normal bases for the two digit-serial architectures. A straightforward implementation leaves gate redundancy in both of them. An algorithm that can considerably reduce the redundancy is also developed. The proposed architectures are compared with the existing ones in terms of gate and time complexities.
