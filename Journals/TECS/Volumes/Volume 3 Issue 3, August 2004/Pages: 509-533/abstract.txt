It is widely recognized that data security will play a central role in future IT systems. Providing public-key cryptographic primitives, which are the core tools for security, is often difficult on embedded processor due to computational, memory, and power constraints. This contribution appears to be the first thorough comparison of two public-key families, namely elliptic curve (ECC) and hyperelliptic curve cryptosystems on a wide range of embedded processor types (ARM, ColdFire, PowerPC). We investigated the influence of the processor type, resources, and architecture regarding throughput. Further, we improved previously known HECC algorithms resulting in a more efficient arithmetic.
