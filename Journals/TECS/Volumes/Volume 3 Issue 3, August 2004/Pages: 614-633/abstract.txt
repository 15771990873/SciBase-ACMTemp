Network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) are one of the latest developments in security. The matching of packet strings against collected signatures dominates signature-based NIDS performance. Network processors are also one of the fastest growing segments of the semiconductor market, because they are designed to provide scalable and flexible solutions that can accommodate change quickly and economically. This work presents a fast string-matching algorithm (called FNP) over the network processor platform that conducts matching sets of patterns in parallel. This design also supports numerous practical features such as case-sensitive string matching, signature prioritization, and multiple-content signatures. This efficient multiple-pattern matching algorithm utilizes the hardware facilities provided by typical network processors instead of employing the external lookup co-processors. To verify the efficiency and practicability of the proposed algorithm, it was implemented on the Vitesse IQ2000 network processor platform. The searching patterns used in the present experiments are derived from the well-known Snort ruleset cited by most open-source and commercial NIDSs. This work shows that combining our string-matching methodology, hashing engine supported by most network processors, and characteristics of current Snort signatures frequently improves performance and reduces number of memory accesses compared to conventional string-matching algorithms. Another contribution of this work is to highlight that, besides total number of searching patterns, shortest pattern length is also a major influence on NIDS multipattern matching algorithm performance.
