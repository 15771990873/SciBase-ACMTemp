Application-specific multicore architectures are usually designed by using a configurable platform in which a set of parameters can be tuned to find the best trade-off in terms of the selected figures of merit (such as energy, delay, and area). This multi-objective optimization phase is calledDesign-Space Exploration(DSE). Among the design-time (hardware) configurable parameters we can find the memory subsystem configuration (such as cache size and associativity) and other architectural parameters such as the instruction-level parallelism of the system processors. Among the runtime (software) configurable parameters we can find the degree of task-level parallelism associated with each application running on the platform.The contribution of this article is twofold; first, we introduce an evolutionary (NSGA-II-based) methodology for identifying a hardware configuration which is robust with respect to applications and corresponding datasets. Second, we introduce a novel runtime heuristic that exploits design-time identified operating points to provide guaranteed throughput to each application. Experimental results show that the design-time/runtime combined approach improves the runtime performance of the system with respect to existing reference techniques, while meeting the overall power budget.
