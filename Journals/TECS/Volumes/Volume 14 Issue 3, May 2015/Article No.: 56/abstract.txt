This article examines a hardware multithreaded microprocessor and discusses the impact such an architecture has on existing software energy modeling techniques. A framework is constructed for analyzing the energy behavior of the XMOS XS1-L multithreaded processor and a variation on existing software energy models is proposed, based on analysis of collected energy data. It is shown that by combining execution statistics with sufficient data on the processorâ€™s thread activity and instruction execution costs, a multithreaded software energy model used with Instruction Set Simulation can yield an average error margin of less than 7&percnt;.
