Our aim is to study the information flow problem in hybrid systems, namely systems consisting of a discrete program with an analog environment. Information flows compromise the security of a system because they cause leakage of protected information. In order to tackle information flow in real-life systems, we introduce new classes of hybrid systems that extend the known ones while preserving their properties. Then, we define a logic to specify information flow. By means of some examples, we show that, by this logic, we are able to express information flows in hybrid systems and to certify that some suspect behaviors of these systems do not give rise to any information flow. We give a model checking procedure for our logic, and we prove that it gives a correct answer whenever it terminates. Moreover, for a particular class of hybrid systems, we give a version of the procedure that always terminates.
