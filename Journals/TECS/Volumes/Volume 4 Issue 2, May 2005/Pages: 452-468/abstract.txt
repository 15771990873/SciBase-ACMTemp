We present a customization framework for embedded processors which employs the utilization of application-specific information, thus specializing the processor's microarchitecture to the application needs. The increased processor utilization leads to a low-cost system implementation with no sacrifice in performance requirements and to reduced custom hardware in a typical SOC. We illustrate these ideas through the branch resolution problem, known to impose severe performance degradation on control-dominated embedded applications. A customization approach for early branch resolution and subsequent folding is presented. The application-specific information is captured by the microarchitecture through a low-cost reprogrammable hardware, thus attaining the twin benefits of processor standardization and application-specific customization. Experimental results show that for a representative set of control-dominated applications a reduction in the range of 3--22&percnt; in processor cycles can be achieved, thus extending the scope of low-cost embedded processors in complex codesigns for control intensive systems.
