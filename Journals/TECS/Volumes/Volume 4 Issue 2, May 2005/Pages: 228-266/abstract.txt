We propose a combination of heuristic methods to prove properties of control signals for regular systems defined by means of affine recurrence equations (AREs). We benefit from the intrinsic regularity of the underlying polyhedral model to handle parameterized systems in a symbolic way. Our techniques apply to safety properties. The general proof process consists in an iteration that alternates two heuristics. We are able to identify the cases when this iteration will stop in a finite number of steps. These techniques have been implemented in a high level synthesis environment based on the polyhedral model.
