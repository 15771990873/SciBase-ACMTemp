This special issue is based on innovative ideas presented and discussed during the first ACM/IEEE Conference on Formal Methods and Models for Co-Design (MEMOCODE) held at Mont Saint Michel in France during the summer of 2003. Selected papers from the conference were invited for this special issue together with an open call for papers soliciting novel contributions on the topics of this conference. Rigorous reviews of 12 submissions led to the selection of four papers for this special issue. In this editorial statement, we outline the premise and the context of this special issue, and give a short introduction to the theme under consideration and briefly introduce the papers selected. We also thank the authors who submitted their contributions to this special issue, and all the reviewers without whose dedication and hard work toward ensuring the quality of the selections, editing this special issue would have been impossible.
