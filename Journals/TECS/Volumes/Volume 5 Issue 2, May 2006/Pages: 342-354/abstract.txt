Scheduling decision for real-time embedded software applications has a great impact on system performance and, therefore, is an important issue in RTOS design. Moreover, it is highly desirable to have the system designer able to evaluate and select the right scheduling policy at high abstraction levels, in order to allow faster exploration of the design space. In this paper, we address this problem by introducing an abstract RTOS model, as well as a new approach to refine an unscheduled high-level model to a high-level model with RTOS scheduling. This approach is based on SystemC language and enables the system designer to quickly evaluate different dynamic scheduling policies and make the optimal choice in early design stages. Furthermore, we present a case of study where our model is used to simulate and analyze a telecom system.
