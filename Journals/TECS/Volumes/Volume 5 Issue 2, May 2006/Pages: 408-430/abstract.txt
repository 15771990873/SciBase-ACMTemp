New sophisticated EDA tools and methodologies will be needed to make products viable in the future marketplace by simplifying the various design stages. These tools will permit system design at a high abstraction level and enable automatic refinement through several abstraction levels to obtain a final prototype. They will have to be based on representations that are clean, complete, and easy to manipulate. In order to develop these new EDA tools, key features such as standardization, metadata programming, reflectivity, and introspection are needed. This work proposes a .Net Framework-based methodology, which possesses all these required key features. This methodology simplifies specification, synthesis, and validation of systems and enables the efficient creation/customization of EDA tools at low cost and development time. We show the effectiveness of this methodology by presenting its application for the design of a new EDA tool called ESys .Net (Embedded System design with .Net). We emphasize the specification and simulation aspects of this tool.
