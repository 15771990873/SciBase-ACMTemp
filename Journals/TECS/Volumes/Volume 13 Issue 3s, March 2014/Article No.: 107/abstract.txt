Heterogeneity and parallelism in MPSoCs for 4G (and beyond) communications signal processing are inevitable in order to meet stringent power constraints and performance requirements. The question arises on how to cope with the problem of system programmability and runtime management incurred by the statically or even dynamically varying number and type of processing elements. This work addresses this challenge by proposing the concept of a heterogeneous many-core platform called Tomahawk. Apart from the definition of the system architecture, in this approach a unified framework including a model of computation, a programming interface and a dedicated runtime management unit called CoreManager is proposed. The increase of system complexity in terms of application parallelism and number of resources may lead to a dramatic increase of the management costs, hence causing performance degradation. For this reason, the efficient implementation of the CoreManager becomes a major issue in system design. This work compares the performance and capabilities of various CoreManager HW/SW solutions, based on ASIC, RISC and ASIP paradigms. The results demonstrate that the proposed ASIP-based solution approaches the performance of the ASIC realization, while preserving the full flexibility of the software (RISC-based) implementation.
