Multicore processors have the potential to deliver scalable performance by distributing computation across multiple cores. However, the communication cost of parallel application thread execution may significantly limit the performance achievable due to latency and contention on shared resources in the on-chip network of multicores experienced by packets from critical threads. We present PAIS, Parallelism-Aware Interconnect Scheduling, that bolsters performance and energy efficiency of parallel applications. PAIS dynamically detects thread execution progress based on communication latency and scheduling, and it accelerates communication for slowly executing threads by prioritizing packets from those threads with flow control and priority-based arbitration.
