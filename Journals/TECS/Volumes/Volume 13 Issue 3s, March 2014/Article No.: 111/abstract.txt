Energy optimization is a critical design concern for embedded systems. Combining DVFS&plus;DPMis considered as one preferable technique to reduce energy consumption. There have been optimal DVFS&plus;DPMalgorithms for periodic independent tasks running on uniprocessor in the literature. Optimal combination of DVFSand DPMfor periodic dependent tasks on multicore systems is however not yet reported. The challenge of this problem is that the idle intervals of cores are not easy to model. In this article, a novel technique is proposed to directly model the idle intervals of individual cores such that both DVFSand DPMcan be optimized at the same time. Based on this technique, the energy optimization problem is formulated by means of mixed integrated linear programming. We also present techniques to prune the exploration space of the formulation. Experimental results using real-world benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to existing approaches.
