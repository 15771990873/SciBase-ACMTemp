The traffic pattern has significant impact on the performance of network-on-chip. Many recent studies have shown that multimedia applications can be supported in on-chip interconnects. Driven by the motivation of evaluating on-chip interconnects in multimedia embedded systems, a new analytical model is proposed to investigate the performance of the fat-tree based on-chip interconnection network under bursty multimedia traffic and nonuniform message destinations. Extensive simulation experiments are conducted to validate the accuracy of the model, which is then adopted as a cost-efficient tool to investigate the effects of bursty multimedia traffic with nonuniform destinations on the network performance.
