Adaptation is increasingly used in the development of safety-critical embedded systems, in particular to reduce hardware needs and to increase availability. However, composing a system from many reconfigurable components can lead to a huge number of possible system configurations, inducing a complexity that cannot be handled during system design. To overcome this problem, we propose a new component-based modeling and verification method for adaptive embedded systems. The component-based modeling approach facilitates abstracting a composition of components to a hierarchical component. In the hierarchical component, the number of possible configurations of the composition is reduced to a small number of hierarchical configurations. Only these hierarchical configurations have to be considered when the hierarchical component is used in further compositions such that design complexity is reduced at each hierarchical level. In order to ensure well-definedness of components, we provide a model of computation enabling the formal verification of critical requirements of the adaptation behavior.
