The article deals with Distributed Multiagent Reconfigurable Embedded Control Systems following the International Industrial Standard IEC61499 in which a Function Block (Abbreviated by FB) is an event-triggered software component owning data and a control system is a network of distributed blocks. We define a multiagent embedded architecture in which aReconfiguration Agentis affected to each device of the execution environment to apply local reconfigurations, and aCoordination Agentis proposed for coordination between devices in order to guarantee safe and coherent distributed reconfigurations. A Communication Protocol is proposed to handle such coordination by using well-definedCoordination Matrices. A prototype is developed to simulate the whole architecture when faults occur or system’s optimizations are applied. We specify Reconfiguration Agents to be modeled by nested state machines, and the Coordination Agent according to the formalism Net Condition/Event Systems (Abbreviated by NCES) which is an extension of Petri nets. To allow correct and coherent distributed reconfigurations, we check all possible interactions between controllers by verifying that whenever a reconfiguration is applied in a device, the Coordination Agent and other concerned devices react as described in user requirements. We propose finally XML-based implementations of both Coordination and Reconfiguration Agents according the the technology IEC61499. The article’s contributions are applied to two Benchmark Production Systems available in our research laboratory.
