A transition-controlled deadlock detection and recovery prevention policy is presented for a subclass of Petri nets used to model flexible manufacturing systems. The subclass is called systems of simple sequential processes with resources (S3PR). The proposed policy is different from the standard deadlock prevention policies. Instead of adding control places, this policy adds a controlled transition to solve a group of deadlocked markings that have the same graph-based property. Finally, the results of our study indicate that the proposed policy appears to be more permissive than those existing ones that add control places.
