Wearable gesture recognition enables context aware applications and unobtrusive HCI. It is realized by applying machine learning techniques to data from on-body sensor nodes. We present an gesture recognition system minimizing power while maintaining a run-time application defined performance target through dynamic sensor selection.Compared to the non managed approach optimized for recognition accuracy (95&percnt; accuracy), our technique can extend network lifetime by 4 times with accuracy >90&percnt; and by 9 times with accuracy >70&percnt;. We characterize the approach and outline its applicability to other scenarios.
