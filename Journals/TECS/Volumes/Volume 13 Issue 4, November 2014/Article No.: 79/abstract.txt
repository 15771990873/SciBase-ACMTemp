The recent emergence of various Non-Volatile Memories (NVMs), with many attractive characteristics such as low leakage power and high-density, provides us with a new way of addressing the memory power consumption problem. In this article, we target embedded CMPs, and propose a novel Hybrid Scratch Pad Memory (HSPM) architecture which consists of SRAM and NVM to take advantage of the ultra-low leakage power, high density of NVM, and fast access of SRAM. A novel data allocation algorithm as well as an algorithm to determine the NVM/SRAM ratio for the novel HSPM architecture are proposed. The experimental results show that the data allocation algorithm can reduce the memory access time by 33.51&percnt; and the dynamic energy consumption by 16.81&percnt; on average for the HSPM architecture when compared with a greedy algorithm. The NVM/SRAM size determination algorithm can further reduce the memory access time by 14.7&percnt; and energy consumption by 20.1&percnt; on average.
