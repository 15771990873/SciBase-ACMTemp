Hardware-based parallel computing is proposed for acceleration of finite-element (FE) analysis of linear elastic deformation models. An implementation of the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient algorithm onNField Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) devices solves the large linear system of equations arising from the FE discretization. The system employs a large number of customized fixed-point computing units with a high-throughput memory architecture. An implementation of this scalable architecture on four Altera EP3SE110 FPGA devices yields a peak performance of 604 Giga Operations per second. This enables haptic simulation of a 3-dimensional deformable object of 21000 elements at an update rate of 400Hz.
