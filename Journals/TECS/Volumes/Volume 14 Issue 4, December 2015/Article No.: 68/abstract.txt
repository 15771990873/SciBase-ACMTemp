In this article, we present a mathematical characterisation of admissible schedules of cyclo-static dataflow (csdf) graphs. We demonstrate how algebra ic manipulation of this characterization is related to unfoldingcsdfactors and how this manipulation allowscsdfgraphs to be transformed intomrsdfgraphs that areequivalent, in the sense that they admit the same set of schedules. The presented transformation allows the rich set of existing analysis techniques formrsdfgraphs to be applied tocsdfgraphs and generalizes the well-known transformations fromcsdfandmrsdfintohsdf. Moreover, it gives rise to an incremental approach to the analysis ofcsdfgraphs, where approximate analyses are combined with exact transformations. We show the applicability of this incremental approach by demonstrating its effectiveness on the problem of optimizing buffer sizes under a throughput constraint.
