The article introduces a parametric extension of Action-Restricted Computation Tree Logic called pmARCTL. A symbolic fixed-point algorithm providing a solution to the exhaustive parameter synthesis problem is proposed. The parametric approach allows for an in-depth system analysis and synthesis of the correct parameter values. The time complexity of the problem and the algorithm is provided. An existential fragment of pmARCTL (pmEARCTL) is identified, in which all of the solutions can be generated from a minimal and unique base. A method for computing this base using symbolic methods is provided. The prototype tool SPATULA implementing the algorithm is applied to the analysis of three benchmarks: faulty Train-Gate-Controller, Petersonâ€™s mutual exclusion protocol, and a generic pipeline processing network. The experimental results show efficiency and scalability of our approach compared to the naive solution to the problem.
