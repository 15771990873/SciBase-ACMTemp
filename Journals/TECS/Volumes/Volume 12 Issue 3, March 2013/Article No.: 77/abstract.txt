Recent advances in circuit and semiconductor technologies have pushed Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) technologies into a new era. These technologies exhibit appealing properties such as low power consumption, non-volatility, shock-resistivity, and high density. However, there are challenges to which we need answers in the road of applying non-volatile memories as main memory in embedded computer systems. First, when compared with DRAM, NVMs have a limited number of write/erase cycles. Second, write activities on NVM are more expensive than DRAM memory in terms of energy consumption and access latency. Both challenges will benefit from the reduction of the write activities on the NVMs.In this paper, we target embedded Chip Multiprocessors (CMPs) with Scratch Pad Memory (SPM) and non-volatile main memory. We introduce scheduling, data migration, and recomputation techniques to reduce the number of write activities on NVMs. Experimental results show that the proposed methods can reduce the number of writes by 58.46&percnt; on average, which means that the NVM can last 2.8 times as long as before. For Phase Change Memory (PCM), the lifetime is extended from 2.5 years to about 7 years on average and 15 years at the most. Also, the finish time of the tested programs is reduced by an average of 38.07&percnt;, and the energy consumption is reduced by an average of 51.23&percnt;.
