Recently, interest in incorporating Storage Class Memory (SCM), which blurs the distinction between memory and storage, into mainstream computing has been increasing rapidly. In this paper, we address the emerging questions regarding the use of SCM. Based on an embedded platform that employs FeRAM, a type of SCM, we present our findings. In summary, by introducing SCM, power efficiency improves while performance is degraded. We also show that such performance degradations may be removed with operating system level schemes that fully exploit the characteristics of SCM. Finally, we present permanent computing that supports lightweight system on/off capabilities by using SCM.
