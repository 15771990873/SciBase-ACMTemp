We propose a performance analysis framework for adaptive real-time synchronous data flow streaming applications on runtime reconfigurable FPGAs. As the main contribution, we present a constraint based approach to capture both streaming application execution semantics and the varying design concerns during reconfigurations. With our event models constructed as cumulative functions on data streams, we exploit a novel compile-time analysis framework based on iterative timing phases. Finally, we implement our framework on a public domain constraint solver, and illustrate its capabilities in the analysis of design trade-offs due to reconfigurations with experiments.
