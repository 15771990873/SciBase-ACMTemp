Caches are known to consume a large part of total microprocessor power. Traditionally, voltage scaling has been used to reduce both dynamic and leakage power in caches. However, aggressive voltage reduction causes process-variation--induced failures in cache SRAM arrays, which compromise cache reliability. In this article, we propose FFT-Cache, a flexible fault-tolerant cache that uses a flexible defect map to configure its architecture to achieve significant reduction in energy consumption through aggressive voltage scaling while maintaining high error reliability. FFT-Cache uses a portion of faulty cache blocks as redundancy—using block-level or line-level replication within or between sets—to tolerate other faulty caches lines and blocks. Our configuration algorithm categorizes the cache lines based on degree of conflict between their blocks to reduce the granularity of redundancy replacement. FFT-Cache thereby sacrifices a minimal number of cache lines to avoid impacting performance while tolerating the maximum amount of defects. Our experimental results on a processor executing SPEC2K benchmarks demonstrate that the operational voltage of both L1/L2 caches can be reduced down to 375 mV, which achieves up to 80&percnt; reduction in the dynamic power and up to 48&percnt; reduction in the leakage power. This comes with only a small performance loss (<&percnt;5) and 13&percnt; area overhead.
