We have implemented a two-dimensional systolic array QR decomposition on a Xilinx Virtex5 FPGA using the Givens rotation algorithm. QR decomposition is a key step in many DSP applications including sonar beamforming, channel equalization, and 3G wireless communication. Compared to previous work that implements Givens rotations using a one-dimensional systolic array, our implementation uses a truly two-dimensional systolic array architecture. As a result, latency scales well for larger matrices. In addition, prior work avoids divide and square root operations in the Givens rotation algorithm by using special operations such as CORDIC or special number systems such as the logarithmic number system (LNS). In contrast, our design uses straightforward floating-point divide and square root implementations, which makes it easier to be used within a larger system. In our design, the input matrix size can be configured at compile time to many different sizes, making it easily scalable to future large FPGAs or over multiple FPGAs. The QR module is fully pipelined with a throughput of over 130MHz for the IEEE single-precision floating-point format. The peak performance for a 12 Ã— 12 input matrix is approximately 35 GFLOPs.
