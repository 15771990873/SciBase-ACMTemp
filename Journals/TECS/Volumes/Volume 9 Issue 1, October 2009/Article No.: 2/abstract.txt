This article explores methods to reconfigure infinite impulse response (IIR) filters in processes that utilize computer resource management. A high-performance mode uses a full-length IIR filter, while low resources or a desire to conserve power triggers a low-performance mode where a smaller length filter is used. Two alternatives for algorithms are explored: switching between filter banks of varying lengths, and anytime filters where the later stages can be skipped if computational resources are scarce. Two main challenges are addressed in this article. The first is how to configure an IIR filter as an anytime algorithm, and the second is how to initialize the states of the filters in order to mitigate transients induced by reconfiguration. The performance and feasibility of several common transient management schemes are investigated for use in this application. It is found that an anytime IIR filter outperforms the filter banks in almost every case studied due to its inherently smaller transients and the fact that the reconfiguration happens at the speed of resource management and not at a lower speed typically associated with reconfiguration due to physical system properties.
