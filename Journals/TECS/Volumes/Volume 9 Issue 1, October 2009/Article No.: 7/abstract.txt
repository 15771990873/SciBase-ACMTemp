A packet-switched network architecture named Qnet and programming interface is presented that simplifies the integration of reconfigurable computing modules within a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Qnet provides an abstraction layer to the designer of FPGA accelerator modules that hides the complexities of the system, while supporting a high degree of parallelism and performance. The architecture facilitates system design with pluggable, reusable modules. A network protocol is described that supports a three-party communication scheme between an initiator, a sender and a receiver. This protocol allows a master device to manage the state of other devices and the data flow within the system. An example using a high-level language is given. The Qnet architecture opens the computational power of FPGAs to computer scientists and software developers.
