To ensure thermal safety and to avoid performance degradation from temperature regulation in 3D NoC, we propose a new temperature-traffic control framework. The framework contains the vertical throttling-based runtime thermal management (VT-RTM) scheme and the transport-layer assisted routing (TLAR) scheme. VT-RTM scheme increases the cooling speed and maintains high availability. TLAR scheme sustains the throughput of the nonstationary irregular mesh network. In our experiments, VT-RTM scheme reduces cooling time by 84&percnt; and achieves 98&percnt; network availability; the overall performance impact is around 8&percnt; of traditional schemes. TLAR scheme reduces average latency by 35âˆ¼&percnt; and improves sustainable throughput by 76&percnt;
