DRAM is usually used as main memory for program execution. The thermal behavior of a memory block in a 3D SIP is affected not only by the power behavior but also the heat dissipating ability of that block. The power behavior of a block is related to the applications run on the system, while the heat dissipating ability is determined by the number of tier and the position the block locates. Therefore, a thermal-aware memory allocator should consider the following two points. First, the allocator should consider not only the power behavior of a logic block but also the physical location during memory mapping and second, the changing temperature of a physical block during execution of programs. In this article, we will propose a memory mapping algorithm taking into consideration these two points. Our technique can be classified as static thermal management to be applied to embedded software designs. Experiments show that for single-core systems, our method can reduce the temperature of memory system by 17.1째C, as compared to a straightforward mapping in the best case, and 13.3째C on average. For systems with four cores, the temperature reductions are 9.9째C and 11.6째C on average when L1 cache of each core is set to 4KB and 8KB, respectively.
