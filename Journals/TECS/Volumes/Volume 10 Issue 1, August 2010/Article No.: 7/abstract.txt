This article presents an approach to providing real-time support for Java's Remote Method Invocation (RMI) and its integration with the RTSJ memory model in order to leave out garbage collection. A new construct for remote objects, calledNo-heap Remote object(NhRo), is introduced. The use of a NhRo guarantees that memory required to perform a remote invocation (at the server side) does not use heap memory. Thus, the aim is to avoid garbage collection in the remote invocation process, improving predictability and memory isolation of distributed Java-based real-time applications. The article presents the bare model and the main programming patterns that are associated with the NhRo model. Sun RMI implementation has been modified to integrate the NhRo model in both static and dynamic environments.
