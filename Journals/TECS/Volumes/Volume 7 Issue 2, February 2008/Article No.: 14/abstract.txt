This paper explores the design and implementation of BORPH, an operating system designed for FPGA-based reconfigurable computers. Hardware designs execute as normal UNIX processes under BORPH, having access to standard OS services, such as file system support. Hardware and software components of user designs may, therefore, run as communicating processes within BORPH's runtime environment. The familiar language independent UNIX kernel interface facilitates easy design reuse and rapid application development. To develop hardware designs, a Simulink-based design flow that integrates with BORPH is employed. Performances of BORPH on two on-chip systems implemented on a BEE2 platform are compared.
