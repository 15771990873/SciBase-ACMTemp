Currently, system-on-chip (SoC) designs are becoming increasingly complex, with more and more components being integrated into a single SoC design. Communication between these components is increasingly dominating critical system paths and frequently becomes the source of performance bottlenecks. It, therefore, becomes imperative for designers to explore the communication space early in the design flow. Traditionally, system designers have used Pin-Accurate Bus Cycle Accurate (PA-BCA) models for early communication space exploration. These models capture all of the bus signals and strictly maintain cycle accuracy, which is useful for reliable performance exploration but results in slow simulation speeds for complex, designs, even when they are modeled using high-level languages. Recently, there have been several efforts to use the Transaction-Level Modeling (TLM) paradigm for improving simulation performance in BCA models. However, these transaction-based BCA (T-BCA) models capture a lot of details that can be eliminated when exploring communication architectures. In this paper, we extend the TLM approach and propose a new transaction-based modeling abstraction level (CCATB) to explore the communication design space. Our abstraction level bridges the gap between the TLM and BCA levels, and yields an average performance speedup of 120&percent; over PA-BCA and 67&percent; over T-BCA models, on average. The CCATB models are not only faster to simulate, but also extremely accurate and take less time to model compared to both T-BCA and PA-BCA models. We describe the mechanisms that produce the speedup in CCATB models and also analyze how the achieved simulation speedup scales with design complexity. To demonstrate the effectiveness of using CCATB for exploration, we present communication space exploration case studies from the broadband communication and multimedia application domains.
