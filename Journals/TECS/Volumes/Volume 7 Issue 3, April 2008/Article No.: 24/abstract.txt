DRAM (dynamic random-access memory) energy consumption in low-power embedded systems can be very high, exceeding that of the data cache or even that of the processor. This paper presents and evaluates a scheme for reducing the energy consumption of SDRAM (synchronous DRAM) memory access by a combination of techniques that take advantage of SDRAM energy efficiencies in bank and row access. This is achieved by using small, cachelike structures in the memory controller to prefetch an additional cache block(s) on SDRAM reads and to combine block writes to the same SDRAM row. The results quantify the SDRAM energy consumption of MiBench applications and demonstrate significant savings in SDRAM energy consumption, 23&percnt;, on average, and reduction in the energy-delay product, 44&percnt;, on average. The approach also improves performance: the CPI is reduced by 26&percnt;, on average.
