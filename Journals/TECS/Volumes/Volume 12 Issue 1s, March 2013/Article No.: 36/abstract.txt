This article proposes a lifetime aware buffer assignment method for streaming applications like multimedia specified in a synchronous dataflow (SDF) graph on a DRAM/PRAM hybrid memory in which the endurance of PRAM is limited. We determine whether buffers are assigned to DRAM or PRAM to minimize the writing frequency of PRAM. To solve the problems, we formulate them using Answer Set Programming. Experimental results show that the proposed approach increases the PRAM lifetime by 63&percnt; compared with no optimization, and shows the tradeoff between PRAM and DRAM size to guarantee a lifetime constraint.
