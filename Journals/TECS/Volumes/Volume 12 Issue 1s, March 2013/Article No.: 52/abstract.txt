Dynamically reconfigurable FPGA (DRFPGA) implements a given circuit system by partitioning it into stages and then executing each stage sequentially. Traditionally, the number of communication buffers is minimized. In this article, we study the partitioning problem targeting at power minimization for the DRFPGAs that have lookup table (LUT) based logic blocks. We analyze the power consumption caused by the communication buffers in the temporal partitioning. Based on the analysis, we use a flow network to represent a given circuit so that the power consumption of buffers is correctly evaluated and the temporal constraints are satisfied in circuit partitioning. The well known flow-based FBB algorithm is then applied to the network to find the area-balanced partitioning of minimum power consumption. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the conventional partitioning algorithms in terms of power consumption. The problem is then extended to include constraints on the number of communication buffers. We provide a net modeling for this extended problem and present an extension of the FBB algorithm to obtain a power-optimal solution. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in reducing power consumption as compared to the previous partitioning algorithms without exceeding the buffer number limit.
