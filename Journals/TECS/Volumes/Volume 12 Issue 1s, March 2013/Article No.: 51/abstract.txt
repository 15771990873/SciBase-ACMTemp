Reliability in embedded systems is crucial for many application domains. Especially, for safety critical application, as they can be found in the automotive and avionic domain, a high reliability has to be ensured. The technology in chip production undergoes a steady shrinking process from nowadays 25 nanometers. It is proven that coming technologies, which are much smaller, can have a higher defect rate after production, but also at runtime. The physical effects at runtime come from a higher susceptibility for radiation. Since the silicon die of a field programmable gate array (FPGA) includes a high amount of physical wiring, the radiation effect plays here a major role. Therefore, this article describes an approach of a reliable Network-on-Chip (NoC) which can be used for an FPGA-based system. The article describes the concept and the physical realization of this NoC and evaluates its reliability.
