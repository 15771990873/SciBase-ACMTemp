SystemC is widely used for modeling and simulation in hardware/software co-design. However, existing verification techniques are mostly ad-hoc and non-systematic. In this article, we present a systematic, comprehensive, and formally founded co-verification framework for digital HW/SW systems that are modeled in SystemC. The framework is based on a formal semantics of SystemC and uses a combination of model checking and testing, whereby testing includes both the automated generation of timed inputs and automated conformance evaluation. We demonstrate its performance and its error detecting capability with two case studies, namely a packet switch and an anti-slip regulation and anti-lock braking system.
