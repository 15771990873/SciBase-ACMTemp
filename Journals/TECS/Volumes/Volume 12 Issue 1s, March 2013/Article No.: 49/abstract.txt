Cyber-Physical Systemsare integrations of computation and physical processes and as such, will be increasingly relevant to industry and people. The complexity of designing CPS resides in their heterogeneity. Heterogeneity manifest itself in modeling their functionality as well as in the implementation platforms that include a multiplicity of components such as microprocessors, signal processors, peripherals, memories, sensors and actuators often integrated on a single chip or on a small package such as a multi-chip module. We need a methodology, tools and environments where heterogeneity can be dealt with at all levels of abstraction and where different tools can be integrated. We present here Platform-Based Design as the CPS methodology of choice andmetroII, a design environment that supports it. We present the metamodeling approach followed inmetroII, how to couple the functionality and implementation platforms of CPS, and the simulation technology that supports the analysis of CPS and of their implementation. We also present examples of use and the integration ofmetroII with another popular design environment developed at Verimag, BIP.
