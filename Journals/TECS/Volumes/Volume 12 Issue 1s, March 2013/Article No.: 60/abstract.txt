In recent years, low-cost flash-memory devices have contributed greatly to the rapid growth of the flash memory market. Given that the most of the cost of such devices is the cost of the flash-memory chips, many vendors are managing the cost of such devices by using flash-memory chips of low quality, and they will continue to do so in the near future. Recognizing strong market demand, this work presents a set-based mapping strategy with an effective implementation and low hardware resource requirements for making downgraded flash-memory chips useable in products. A configurable management design for managing chips of various qualities with improved lifetime is presented. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is evaluated by performing a series of experiments and analyzed with reference to popular implementations in industry.
