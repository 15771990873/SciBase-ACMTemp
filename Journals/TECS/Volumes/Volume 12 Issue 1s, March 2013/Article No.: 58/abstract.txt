We present a new heterogeneous multiprocessor (GALS-HMP) for the execution of Globally Asynchronous Locally Synchronous (GALS) programming languages. It specifically targets SystemJ GALS language, which extends Java with asynchronous and synchronous concurrency. A SystemJ program is partitioned by a compiler onto data-driven and control-driven parts, which are then allocated for the execution on traditional and reactive processors, which constitute GALS-HMP. The reactive processor is customized to meet the requirements of the control parts of the SystemJ programs. The prototypes developed on an FPGA show significant improvements in code size and execution speed compared to the case of using just traditional processors.
