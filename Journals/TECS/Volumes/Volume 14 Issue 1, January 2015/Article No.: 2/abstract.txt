In the Ghiribaldi et al. [2013] paper, a complete self-testing and self configuring NoC infrastructure for cost-effective MPSoCs was presented in order to make NoC architecture tolerant to faults. To overcome the complexity involved during the complete reconfiguration of routing instances in the face of most of the usual failure patterns, Ghiribaldi et al. [2013] proposed a fast self-reconfiguration algorithm. The algorithm is based on segment-based routing implemented using Logic-Based Distributed Routing (LBDR) and claimed to have handled the most common NoC faults.The purpose of this comment is to demonstrate the inconsistency of the fast self-configuration method presented in Ghiribaldi et al. [2013]. To handle inconsistency, we present the correct set of LBDR bits and also argue that complete reconfiguration of the routing instance is mandatory to handle some fault combinations. New coverage results of the fast self-reconfiguration algorithm of Ghiribaldi et al. [2013] are also presented.
