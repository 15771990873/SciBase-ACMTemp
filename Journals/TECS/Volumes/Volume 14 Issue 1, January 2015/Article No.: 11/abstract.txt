The main limitation of the verification approaches based on state enumeration is the state explosion problem. The partial order reduction techniques aim at attenuating this problem by reducing the number of transitions to be fired from each state while preserving properties of interest. Among the reduction techniques proposed in the literature, this article considers the stubborn set method of Petri nets and investigates its extension to time Petri nets. It establishes some useful sufficient conditions for stubborn sets, which preserve deadlocks and k-boundedness of places.
