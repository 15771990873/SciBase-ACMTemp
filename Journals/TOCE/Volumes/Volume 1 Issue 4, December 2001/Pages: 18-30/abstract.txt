The OAMulator is a Web-based resource to support the teaching of instruction set architecture, assembly languages, memory, addressing, high-level programming, and compilation. The tool is based on a simple, virtual CPU architecture, called the One Address Machine. A compiler allows us to take programs written in a special programming language, called OAMPL, and transform them into OAM assembly. An OAM assembler/emulator interprets and executes OAM assembly code produced by the compiler or written directly by students. The OAMulator is targeted at non-CS students who take introductory courses in information technology or information systems. Such students are normally exposed to concepts of computer hardware and software, but it is difficult for them to make the connection between the two. The OAMulator takes the mystery out of CPU architecture by letting students gain confidence with the concepts of compilers and binary execution. The Web-based deployment allows students to work on problems in convenient locations, at their own pace, and with rewarding interaction.
