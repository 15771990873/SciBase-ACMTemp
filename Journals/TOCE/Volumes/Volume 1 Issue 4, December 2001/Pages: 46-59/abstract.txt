CPU Sim 3.1 is an educational software package written in Java for
use in CS3 courses. CPU Sim provides students an active learning
environment in which they can design, modify, and compare various
computer architectures at the register-transfer level and higher.
They can run assembly language or machine language programs for
those architectures through simulation. CPU Sim is a complete
development environment, including dialog boxes for designing the
CPU architecture, a text editor for editing assembly language
programs, an assembler, several display windows for viewing the
registers and RAMs during the execution of programs, and many
debugging features such as the ability to step forward or backward
during execution, inspecting and optionally changing the values in
the registers and RAMs after each step. These features and
suggested uses of CPU Sim in CS3 classes are discussed.
