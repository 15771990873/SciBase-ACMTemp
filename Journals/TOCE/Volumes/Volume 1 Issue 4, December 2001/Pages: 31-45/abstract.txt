The Knob & Switch Computer is a computer architecture simulator
designed to teach beginning students the basics of computer
organization. It differs from existing simulators in two
significant ways: (1) it incorporates cognitive hooks in the form
of knobs and switches that encourage exploration and discovery on
the part of the student; and (2) it can be presented one component
at a time, starting with a simple interactive data path and
building incrementally to a full-featured stored program machine.
Both of these features make it possible to engage beginning
students and effectively convey an understanding of how computers
work. The Knob & Switch Computer simulator can also motivate
the study of other computing topics such as data representation,
assembly language programming, and RISC vs. CISC architectures. In
addition to describing the Knob & Switch Computer, we discuss
experiences using the simulator in breadth-based introductory
courses both at Dickinson College and Creighton University.
