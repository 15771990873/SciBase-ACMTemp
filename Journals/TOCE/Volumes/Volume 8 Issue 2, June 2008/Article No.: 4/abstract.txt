We invite submissions to ACM/JERIC from teaching practitioners who are our readers. Grounding these submissions in the lived practice of teaching; using data that is already collected to assess student learning; and reporting the data collection, analysis, and context of use accurately and honestly are key aspects for taking a scholarly approach to teaching and learning. We hope to see more such scholarly inquiries by computing educators in the pages of future issues.
