In the education literature, team-based projects have proven to be an effective pedagogical methodology. We have been usingRoboCupchallenges as the basis for class projects in undergraduate and masters level courses. This article discusses several independent efforts in this direction and presents our work in the development of shared resources and evaluation instruments. We outline three courses and describe related class projects in order to make the context of our investigation clear and make it possible for others to replicate and extend our work as well as contribute to the shared resource.
