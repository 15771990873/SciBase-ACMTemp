Most electrical engineering and computer science undergraduate programs include at least one course on microcontrollers and assembly language programming. Some departments offer legacy courses in C programming, but few include C programming from an embedded systems perspective, where it is still regularly used. Distributed computing and parallel processing are subjects generally reserved for graduate programs or specialized degrees. And although it is common to provide undergraduate courses on computer networks, the typical curriculum focuses on TCP/IP and Ethernet LANs, rarely venturing into the lesser known but commonly used networks such as the controller area network. By developing a computer cluster using simple microcontroller cards which communicate over a CAN, students are exposed to the intricacies of network communication, basic parallel and distributed processing concepts, and real-time embedded systems development. This paper presents the design of a <i<CAN Microcluster</i<, constructed using low-cost hardware components commonly available in ECE and CECS microcontroller laboratories. The software implementation is evaluated for both assembly language and C, and development issues are discussed.
