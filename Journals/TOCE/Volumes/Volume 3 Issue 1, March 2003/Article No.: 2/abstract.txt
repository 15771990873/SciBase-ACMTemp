Finding new and exciting senior design projects for undergraduate computer engineers can be challenging for both students and faculty advisors. The challenge is even more pronounced when attempting to construct interdisciplinary design projects to better meet ABET 2000 criteria and to better prepare graduating students for careers as engineers. We present an interdisciplinary, honors senior design project incorporating robotics control, algorithmic state machine design, reverse-engineering, assembly programming, and language, and basic compiler design. We believe this two-quarter project was extremely successful, and can be used as a model for similar design projects at other undergraduate institutions.
