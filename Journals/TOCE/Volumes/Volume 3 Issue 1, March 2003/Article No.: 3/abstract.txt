The peer review, known by almost everyone in the academic world, is proposed as a method for computer science classes to improve interaction among student groups. By this method, groups of students publish their assignments over the Internet using the WebCoM tool developed to support this activity. A group of fellow students reviews their work and publishes their findings (in the Internet) also using the WebCoM tool. Finally, the two groups debate their points of view in front of the class (in traditional courses) or in a chat room (in distance education courses). Debate and competition between the groups provide a chance for the students to learn more about each other's work. They also gain an opportunity to learn how to give and receive criticisms in a constructive way. This should increase the students' ability to interact and work in groups: an important skill for computer science professionals. We show how the method is applied and how it is supported by WebCoM. In addition, results from past course experiences are presented to help evaluate the method and the tool.
