Reconfigurable computing is an established field in computer science. Teaching this field to computer science students demands special attention due to limited student experience in electronics and digital system design. This article presents a compact course on reconfigurable processors, which was offered at the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt, and is intended for instructors aiming to introduce a new course in reconfigurable computing. Therefore, a detailed description of the course structure and content is provided. In contrast to courses on digital system design, which use FPGAs as a case platform, our course places this platform at the center of its focus and highlights its features as a basis for reconfigurable computing. Both declarative knowledge and functioning knowledge are considered in defining learning outcomes based on a novel What-Why-How Model. Lab activities were designated to deepen the functioning knowledge. The written exam is aligned to learning outcomes and shows that most students acquired the intended outcomes.
