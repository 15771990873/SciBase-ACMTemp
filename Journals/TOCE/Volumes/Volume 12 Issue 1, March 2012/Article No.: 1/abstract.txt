The teaching-research nexus concept has been extensively examined in the higher education literature, and the importance of industry linkages in information and communications technology (ICT) education has also been widely discussed. However, to date there has been little recognition of the full extent of relationships between aspects of teaching, learning, research, and industry, and of the synergy possible from exploiting these relationships. Koppi and Naghdy [2009] introduced the concept of the teaching-research-industry-learning (TRIL) nexus in ICT education and this article attempts to advance understanding of the concept by exploring the literature that underpins it. The article contributes to a clearer understanding of the nature of the relationships involved as they apply to ICT education, and makes comprehensive recommendations to support strengthening the TRIL nexus in ICT education.
