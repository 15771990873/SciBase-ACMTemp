With the support of a grant from the Sloan Foundation, nine computer scientists from liberal arts colleges came together in October, 1984 to form the Liberal Arts Computer Science Consortium (LACS) and to create a model curriculum appropriate for liberal arts colleges. Over the years the membership has grown and changed, but the focus has remained on helping to establish and maintain high-quality computer science programs in liberal arts colleges. In this report we discuss briefly the history of the group, the series of three curricula produced by LACS, and other contributions of the members to computer science education.
