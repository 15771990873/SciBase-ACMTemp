VizClassis a university classroom environment designed to offer students in computer graphics and engineering courses up-to-date visualization technologies. Three digital whiteboards and a three-dimensional stereoscopic display provide complementary display surfaces. Input devices include touchscreens on the digital whiteboards, remote keyboards, data gloves, and hand-position sensors.We use observations, interviews, and surveys to examine the pedagogical impacts of VizClass for teaching and learning computer graphics and virtual reality. Preliminary findings include positive student and teacher attitudes and greater learner engagement in after-class collaborations.
