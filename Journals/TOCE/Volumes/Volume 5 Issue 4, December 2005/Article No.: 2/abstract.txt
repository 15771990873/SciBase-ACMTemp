Closed laboratories are becoming an increasingly popular approach to teaching introductory computer science courses, as they facilitate structured problem-solving and cooperation. However, most closed laboratories have been designed and implemented without embedded instructional research components for constant evaluation of the laboratories' effectiveness. As a result, it is not convenient to maintain and improve the laboratories over time so that they adapt to changing CS topics, curricula, and student needs. This article reports on an integrated framework for designing, implementing, and maintaining laboratories with embedded instructional research design. Although the activities reported here are part of our department-wide effort to cover CS0, CS1, and CS2, we focus here on the design and implementation of the labs for CS1.
