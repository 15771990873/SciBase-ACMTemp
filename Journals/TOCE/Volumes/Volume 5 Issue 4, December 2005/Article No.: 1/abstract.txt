In introductory computer science courses, the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is commonly used to teach basic object-oriented design. However, there appears to be a lack of suitable software to support this task. Many of the available programs that support UML focus on developing code and not on enhancing learning. Programs designed for educational use sometimes have poor interfaces or are missing common and important features such as multiple selection and undo/redo. Hence the need for software that is tailored to an instructional environment and that has all the useful and needed functionality for that specific task. This is the purpose of minimUML. It provides a minimum amount of UML, just what is commonly used in beginning programming classes, and a simple, usable interface. In particular, minimUML is designed to support abstract design while supplying features for exploratory learning and error avoidance. It supports functionality that includes multiple selection, undo/redo, flexible printing, cut and paste, and drag and drop. In addition, it allows for the annotation of diagrams, through text or free-form drawings, so students can receive feedback on their work. minimUML was developed with the goals of supporting ease of use, of supporting novice students, and of requiring no prior training for its use. This article presents the rationale behind the minimUML design, a description of the tool, and the results of usability evaluations and student feedback on the use of the tool.
