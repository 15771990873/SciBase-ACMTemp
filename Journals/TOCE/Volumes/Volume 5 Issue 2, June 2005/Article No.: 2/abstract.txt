Visual logic puzzles provide a fertile environment for teaching multiple topics in discrete mathematics. Many puzzles can be solved by the repeated application of a small, finite set of strategies. Explicitly reasoning from a strategy to a new puzzle state illustrates theorems, proofs, and logic principles. These provide valuable, concrete examples, in addition to the algebraic proofs that make up most of the examples in textbooks. Creating specialized, pedagogical applets allows more automation of repetitive tasks as well as a framework for discussing and implementing algorithms for solving the puzzles. One such applet is presented here and several possible exercises using it are described.
