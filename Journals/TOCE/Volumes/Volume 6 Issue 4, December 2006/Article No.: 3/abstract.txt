We have developed a computer security workshop designed to instruct post-secondary instructors who want to start a course or laboratory exercise sequence in computer security. This workshop has also been used to provide computer security education to IT professionals and students. It is effective in communicating basic computer security principles as well as an understanding of some of the significant tools and techniques in this area. Evaluations of the workshop have been very positive; we will offer the workshop locally, regionally, and nationally in the next year. The materials from this workshop are available at http://clics.cs.uwec.edu/workshopmaterials.htm.
