Disasters happen all the time; yet despite this, many organizations are caught unprepared or make unrealistic assumptions. These factors create environments that will fail during a disaster. Most information technology (IT) curricula do not cover disaster recovery (DR) plans and strategies in depth.

Courses on network security need to examine DR as a real threat and cover it as a core module. By dispelling the 10 common myths, organizations can better plan, develop, and test true DR plans.
