This special issue includes the first set of articles addressing broadening participation in computing education. The articles span the stages of the pipeline, from introducing middle school children to computer science to retaining underrepresented groups at the university level. The preface presented here outlines the need for increasing the participation of underrepresented minorities, women, and people with disabilities in the development of technology. In addition, the preface summarizes the six articles included in this first (of two) issues on broadening participation.
