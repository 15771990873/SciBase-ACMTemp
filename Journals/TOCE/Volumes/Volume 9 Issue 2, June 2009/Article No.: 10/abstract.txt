Online learning material that students use by themselves is one of the typical usages of algorithm animation (AA). Thus, the integration of algorithm animations into hypertext is seen as an important topic today to promote the usage of algorithm animation in teaching. This article presents an algorithm animation viewer implemented purely using HTML and JavaScript. The viewer is capable of viewing animations inXaal(eXtensible Algorithm Animation Language), a language designed to allow easy transformation of AAs between various formats. This solution is extremely suited for use in hypertext learning material due to the advanced interaction possibilities between learning material (HTML) and the animation.
