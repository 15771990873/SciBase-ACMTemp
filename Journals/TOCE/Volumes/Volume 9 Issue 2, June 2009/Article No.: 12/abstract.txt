We propose an extension of the Teaching Machine project, called Quiz Generator, that allows instructors to produce assessment quizzes in the field of algorithm and data structures quite easily. This extension makes use of visualization techniques and is based on new features of the Teaching Machine that allow third-party visualizers to be added as plugins and on new scripting capabilities. Using these new capabilities, five quiz types have already been produced, which can be applied to any algorithm and/or data structure for which the necessary visualizer plugins exist.
