This special issue includes the second set of articles addressing broadening participation in computing education. The articles span the stages of the pipeline, from introducing middle school children to computer science to retaining under-represented groups at the university level. The preface presented here outlines the need for increasing the participation of under-represented minorities, women, and people with disabilities in the development of technology. In addition, the preface summarizes the seven articles included in this second issue (of two) on broadening participation.
