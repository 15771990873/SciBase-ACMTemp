The clean, simple, and elegant architecture of the classic PDP-8 makes it an ideal candidate for studying concepts in computer organization. The PDP-8 emulator program allows a user to write, edit, assemble, debug, trace, and execute PDP-8 machine code and PDP-8 assembler language programs. With it, the user can obtain a feel for the PDP-8. The PDP-8 emulator program includes a simple built-in text editor which is used to write and edit PDP-8 assembler language programs, an assembler to translate these programs into PDP-8 machine code, and a virtual PDP-8 engine upon which to execute the code. PDP-8 code can be executed from adebugscreen display that allows the user to observe the contents of registers and memory as the code executes or code can be executed using an I/O interface that requires user-written PDP-8 I/O routines. This article provides an introduction to both the PDP-8 architecture and PDP-8 assembler language and discusses how to use the PDP-8 emulator program. The PDP-8 emulator program runs under MS-DOS in a command window.
