The contributions of this work are twofold. First, we describe the design and implementation of a simulation environment for an open-source embedded kernel and an intuitive user interface to complement it. Second, the simulator can be used for embedded program development and research as well as instructional purposes in embedded system classes as a replacement or a complement to hands-on experiments with embedded devices.The technical sections of this article stress the suitability of POSIX Threads (Pthreads) in approximating kernel operations in the simulation environment. We specify the prerequisites for using Pthreads as a means to approximate embedded task execution and suggests an I/O-based representation of device information. The experience gained with a sample implementation stresses the importance of a proper match between a Pthreads implementation and an embedded kernel. We demonstrate the adequacy of both the simulation environment and a graphical user interface to aid program development and debugging. Furthermore, the separation of the simulation component from the user interface provides opportunities to utilize each component separately or even combine them with other components. The simulation environment is publically available, and instructions for installation and use are included in the Appendix. The combination of technical solutions is a contribution toward embedded system simulation, an area that has not been studied much.
