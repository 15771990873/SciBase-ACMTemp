We have been using robots in our artificial intelligence course since fall 2000. We have been using the robots for open-laboratory projects. The projects are designed to emphasize high-level knowledge-based AI algorithms. After three offerings of the course, we paused to analyze the collected data and to see if we could answer the following questions: (i) Are robot projects effective at helping students learn AI concepts? (ii) What advantages, if any, can be attributed to using robots for AI projects? (iii) What are the downsides of using robots for traditional projects in AI? In this article we discuss the results of our evaluation and list the lessons learned.
