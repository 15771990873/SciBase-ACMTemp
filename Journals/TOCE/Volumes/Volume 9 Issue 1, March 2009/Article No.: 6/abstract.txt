Information technology teams are often partially distributed teams (PDTs). A PDT consists of two or more subteams that are separated geographically. This articles describes research focused on the use of PDTs to engage students in “real world” IT team learning about the subject matter while also teaching them the skills they will need to work in global software development teams. Findings from a large-scale international study indicate that the introduction of training modules enhanced perceived learning of appropriate PDT teaming behaviors; students with training reported improved shared team identification, trust, awareness, coordination, competence, and conflict with respect to distant subteam members, and higher overall team performance.
