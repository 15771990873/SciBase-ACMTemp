The ACM Transactions on Computing Education (TOCE) represents a name change and a broadening of scope for the ACM Journal on Educational Resources on Computing (JERIC). The topics covered by this new journal will range across diverse aspects of computing education: traditional computer science, computer engineering, software engineering, information technology, and informatics; emerging aspects of computing; and applications of computing to other disciplines, such as computational biology. The common characteristics shared by these articles are a scholarly approach to teaching and learning, a broad appeal to educational practitioners, and a clear connection to student learning.
