In the last few years the (semi-) automatic sequencing of course    material has become an important research issue, particularly the           standardization of metadata for educational resources. Sequencing can help to generate hypermedia documents which, at their best match the learner's   needs. To perform (semi-) automatic course sequencing, a knowledge library as well as modular resources can be used. Both must be described by         metadata.First, metadata standards (IEEE Learning Objects Metadata,             Instructional Mangement Systems Global Learning Consortium, Dublin Core) are analyzed with regard to course  sequencing.    As an application example, Multibook, an adaptive hypermedia system used to teach multimedia technology, is described. Multibook uses metadata to create course sequences semi-automatically. In this article we explain how a knowledge library can be used to create exercises automatically. We give an example of how courses can be sequenced in general by analyzing the creation of exercises. An evaluation of our system shows the advantages and drawbacks of the automatic sequencing approach.are analyzed with regard to course sequencing.
