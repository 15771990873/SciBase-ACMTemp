Computer networks and distribute systems are characterized by highly dynamic, concurrent, and complex processes. Thus, training in this area requires great effort from both teachers and learners. Teachers are disatisfied with available methods for presentation, explanation, and exercises, and they are looking for better methods to support learners.We have developed and architecture called Highly interactive simulation of algorithms and Protocols (HiSAP), consisting of a framework to build simulations and generate applets from formally specified algorithms or protocols. By modifying this specification and observing the resulting behavior, teaching and learning in a constructive manner is enabled. The framework is open to plug-in tools to show various aspects of HiSAP's  behavior.We present the results of some experiments with HiSAP at three different lectures for graduate students of distributed systems and computer networks.
