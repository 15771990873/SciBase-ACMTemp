There have been growing criticisms in recent years among the computer and video games community on the apparent lack of graduates capable of meeting the industry’s employment needs. Following the sharp rise in the number of computer and video games courses across higher education (HE) institutions in the UK and across the globe, this article examines the composition of existing British games design, development, and art programs in relation to prescribed study areas voiced by industry bodies. From a sample of 242 courses, and a further 11 industry-derived and accredited programs, the results explore content currently residing within a variety of games programs and qualification types and evaluate the extent to which such content adheres to the industry’s demand for the focus on specific skills and study areas. The findings point toward certain shortfalls in some key areas deemed to be important by industry professionals and the consideration of the degree to which course providers should cater to the specific demands of industry.
