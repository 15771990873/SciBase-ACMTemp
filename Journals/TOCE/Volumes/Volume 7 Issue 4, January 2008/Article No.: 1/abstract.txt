This special issue features a set of papers recently published in the 3rd International Workshop on Computing Education Research (ICER'07). The papers were selected because they closely meet the publication criteria for ACM/JERIC: stemming from computing education practice, grounded in relevant literature, containing analysis of primary empirical data collected to support specific claims, and providing implications for practice. In addition, the diverse set of research methods used demonstrates how empirical methods can be chosen to serve the specific questions of interest, whether for purposes of research or for improvement of teaching practice. This set of papers can therefore serve as examplars and resources for the educator wishing to develop a wider range of tools for probing issues of teaching and learning within the classroom.
