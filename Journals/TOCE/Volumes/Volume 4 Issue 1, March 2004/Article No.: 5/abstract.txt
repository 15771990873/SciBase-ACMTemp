The decline in the number of women in computing disciplines has been attributed to different causes, and research on the decline continues to grow. While there are numerous reasons suggested for the imbalance in these disciplines, the perceptions that women hold about their computing capabilities continue to be of interest. The current study investigates how a vicarious learning experience can be used to influence computer selfefficacy. To implement the vicarious experience, a computer-assisted peer-modeling instruction aide was developed. The study reveals that vicarious learning has a significant impact on female and male computer selfefficacy, and that the impact may be more significant for females.
