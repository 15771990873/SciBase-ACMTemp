This article presents a project-based case study that was developed for students with diverse backgrounds and varied inclinations for engaging technical topics. The project, called History Places, requires that student teams develop a vision for a kind of digital library, propose a conceptual model, and use the model to derive a logical model and information retrieval specification. From these two design representations, students implement a data-driven Web site that enables users to browse content and search by exact and best-match queries. The project brief contains a set of general requirements that promote creative solutions, while also bounding the complexity of the solution space. The article includes teaching notes and a conceptual model, expressed as an enhanced entity-relationship model in UML. The model, consisting of approximately ten entities, contains binary, unary, ternary, and specialization/generalization relationships. The article concludes with some reflections based on the experiences of using this project in six classes over four years.
