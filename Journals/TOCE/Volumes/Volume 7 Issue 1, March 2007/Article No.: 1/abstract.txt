As the new Editors-in-Chief, we outline our vision for building JERIC to become the premier journal in computing education. Doing so will requireauthorswho submit high-quality articles--their &ldquor;best stuff&rdquor;,reviewerswho provide the feedback and guidance to ensure that each article embodies a scholarly approach to teaching and learning while being of practical use to the computing educator, andreaderswho read the articles, critically evaluate and discuss the findings with others, and adapt, adopt, and evaluate these findings in their own classrooms.
