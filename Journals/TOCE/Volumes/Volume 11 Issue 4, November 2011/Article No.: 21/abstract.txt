The goal of this editorial is to both encourage authors to continue to submit articles describing computational tools for computing education to TOCE, and to make explicit our expectations as the editors of TOCE for what makes a good “tools” article. We elaborate three key criteria, and provide examples from previous TOCE papers that satisfy these criteria: 1) establish that the tool is related essentially to computing education, 2) make explicit claims about the impact of the tool on learning, and 3) evidence these claims through actual use.
