This editorial introduces a set of articles in the JERIC special issue on resources for the computer security and information assurance curriculum. It begins with a discussion of why such a special edition is needed and continues by outlining the articles in this volume, as follows: an innovative model for security education based on teaching hospitals; teaching context in computer security through metaphors; tools supporting exploration of cryptography; suggestions for a hands-on Linux course geared towards a student population that includes noncomputer scientists; and finally, projects suitable for a course in computer forensics.
