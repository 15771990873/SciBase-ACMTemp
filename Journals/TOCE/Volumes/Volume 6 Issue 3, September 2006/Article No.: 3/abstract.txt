This article investigates teaching the application of technical ideas by non-technical means, especially by using puzzles to engage students. After discussing the need to teach students to evaluate contexts in which decisions about computer security must be made, we suggest questions and scenarios drawn from political science, history, as well as other humanities, to force students to apply or derive principles of computer security in unusual and unexpected situations. Our experience shows that students find the process enjoyable, stimulating, and effective.
