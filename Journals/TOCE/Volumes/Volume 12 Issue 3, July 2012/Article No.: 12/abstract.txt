This exploratory qualitative study examines computing professional’s memories of their own formal and non-formal educational experiences, their reflections on how these have prepared them for their professional roles, and their recommendations for an “ideal” undergraduate degree program. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews of experienced computing professionals. Ongoing on-the-job learning is a natural part of professionals’ work lives. Participants indicate that important elements in an undergraduate degree program include foundational computing topics, development of critical thinking and communications skills, and a strong emphasis on experiences similar to those encountered in a professional position, such as complex, realistic group projects. Specific programming languages and technologies should be used only as practice in solving problems and learning on one’s own.
