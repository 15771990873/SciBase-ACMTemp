A theory of distributed simulation applicable to both discrete-event and continuous simulation is presented. It derives many existing simulation algorithms from the theory and describes an implementation of a new algorithm derived from the theory. A high-level discrete-event simulation language has been implemented, using the new algorithm, on parallel computers; performance results of the implementation are also presented.
