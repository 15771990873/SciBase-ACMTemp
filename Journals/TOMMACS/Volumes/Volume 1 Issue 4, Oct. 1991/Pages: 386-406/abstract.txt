We provide upper and lower bounds and an approximation for speedup of an optimistic self-initiated distributed simulation using a very simple model. We assume an arbitrary number of processors and a uniform connection topology. By showing that the lower bound increases essentially linearly withP, the number of processors, we find that the optimistic approach scales well asPincreases. The model tracks the progress of Global Virtual Time (GVT) and eliminates the need to know the virtual time positions of all processors, thus making the analysis quite straightforward.
