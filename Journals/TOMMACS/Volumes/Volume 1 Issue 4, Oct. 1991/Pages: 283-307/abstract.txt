Recently there has been a great deal of interest in performance evalution of parallel simulation. Most work is devoted to the time complexity and assumes that the amount of memory available for parallel simulation is unlimited.  This paper studies the space complexity of parallel simulation. Our goal is to design an efficient memory management protocol which guarantees that the memory consumption of parallel simulation is of the same order as sequential simulation. (Such an algorithm is referred to as aoptimal.) First, we derive the relationships among the space complexities of sequential simulation, Chandy-Misra simulation [2], and Time Warp simulation [7]. We show that Chandy-Misra may consume more storage than sequential simulation, or vice versa. Then we show  that Time Warp never consumes less memory than sequential simulation. Then we describecancelback, an optimal Time Warp memory management protocol proposed by Jefferson. Although cancelback is considered to be complete solution for the storage management problem in Time Warp, some efficiency issues in implementing this algorithm must be considered. We propose an optimal algorithm calledartifical rollback. We show that this algorithm is easy to implement and analyze. An implementation of artificial rollback is given, which is integrated with processor scheduling to adjust the memory consumption rate based on the amount of free storage available in the system.
