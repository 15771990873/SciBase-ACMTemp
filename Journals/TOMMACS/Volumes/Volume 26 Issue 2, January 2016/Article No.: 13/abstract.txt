In this article, we present MaD0, an ultrafast nonlinear pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) for noncryptographic applications. MaD0 uses byte-oriented operations for state initialization and fast integer-oriented operations for state transition and pseudorandom number generation. Its state transition follows a pseudorandom mapping. MaD0 generates high-quality pseudorandom numbers and reaches a generation speed of half cycle per byte on an Intel Core i3 processor. It has a state space of 2,240 bits and an expected period length around 21120. It also shows other good properties, such as fast recovery from biased states and ease of use.
