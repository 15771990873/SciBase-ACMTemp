The generalized feed back shift register (GFSR) algorithm suggested by Lewis and Payne is a widely used pseudorandom number generator, but has the following serious drawbacks: (1) an initialization scheme to assure higher order equidistribution is involved and is time consuming; (2) each bit of the generated words constitutes anm-sequence based on a primitive trinomials, which shows poor randomness with respect to weight distribution; (3) a large working area is necessary; (4) the period of sequence is far shorter than the theoretical upper bound. This paper presents the twisted GFSR (TGFSR) algorithm, a slightly but essentially modified version of the GFSR, which solves all the above problems without loss of merit. Some practical TGFSR generators were implemented and passed strict empirical tests. These new generators are most suitable for simulation of a large distributive system, which requires a number of mutually independent pseudorandom number generators with compact size.
