We present a model for representing stationary multivariate time-series input processes with marginal distributions from the Johnson translation system and an autocorrelation structure specified through some finite lag. We then describe how to generate data accurately to drive computer simulations. The central idea is to transform a Gaussian vector autoregressive process into the desired multivariate time-series input process that we presume as having a VARTA (Vector-Autoregressive-To-Anything) distribution. We manipulate the autocorrelation structure of the Gaussian vector autoregressive process so that we achieve the desired autocorrelation structure for the simulation input process. We call this thecorrelation-matching problemand solve it by an algorithm that incorporates a numerical-search procedure and a numerical-integration technique. An illustrative example is included.
