This article presents the Heterogeneous Flow System Specification (HFSS), a formalism aimed to represent hierarchical and modular hybrid flow systems with dynamic structure. The concept of hybrid flow systems provides a generalization of the conventional concept of hybrid system and it can represent a whole plethora of systems, namely: discrete event systems, multicomponent and multirate numerical methods, multirate and multicomponent sampling systems, event locators and time-varying systems. The ability to join all these types of models makes HFSS an excellent framework for merging components built in different paradigms. We present several examples of model definition in the HFSS formalism and we also exploit the ability of the HFSS formalism to represent mutirate numerical integrators.
