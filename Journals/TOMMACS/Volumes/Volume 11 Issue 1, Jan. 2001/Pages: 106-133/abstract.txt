We describe the architecture, design, components, and functionality of the Distributed Mission Training Integrated Threat Environment (DMTITE) software. The DMTITE architecture and design support the development and run-time operation of computer-generated actors (CGAs) in distributed simulations. The architecture and design employ object-oriented techniques, component software, object frameworks, containerization, and rapid prototyping technologies. The DMTITE architecture and design consist of highly modular components where interdependencies are well defined and minimized. DMTITE is an open architecture and open design, and most component and framework code is open source. The DMTITE architecture and design have been implemented (including all system components and frameworks)  and currently support a number of types of computer-generated actors. The DMTITE architecture, design, and implementation are capable of supporting multiple reasoning, vehicle dynamics, skill level, and migration requirements for any type of CGA.
