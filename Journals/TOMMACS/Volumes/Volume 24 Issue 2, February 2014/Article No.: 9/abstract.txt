In this article, we consider a Gaussian random fieldf(t) living on a compact setT⊂Rdand the computation of the tail probabilitiesP(∫Tef(t)dt>eb) asb→ ∞. We design asymptotically efficient importance sampling estimators for a general class of Hölder continuous Gaussian random fields. In addition to the variance control, we also analyze the bias (relative to the interesting tail probabilities) caused by the discretization.
