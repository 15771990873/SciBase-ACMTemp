This article introduces SESSL (&lowbarS;imulation &lowbarE;xperiment &lowbarS;pecification via a &lowbarS;cala &lowbarL;ayer), an embedded domain-specific language for simulation experiments. It serves as an additional software layer between users and simulation systems and is implemented in Scala. SESSL supports multiple simulation systems and offers various features (e.g., for experiment design, performance analysis, result reporting, and simulation-based optimization). It supports “cutting-edge” experiments by allowing to add custom code, enables a reuse of functionality across simulation systems, and improves the reproducibility of simulation experiments.
