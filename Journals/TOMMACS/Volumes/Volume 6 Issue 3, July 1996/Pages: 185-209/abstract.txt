Many similar algorithms for performing simulations of hard-sphere have been presented. Among these algorithms are those designed by Rapaport (RAP), Lubachevsky (LUB), Krantz (HAD), and Marin (HYBRID). These algorithms exhibit a similar design in that they each use anO(logn) event queue which becomes the overwhelming bottleneck when simulating large systems. In this paper the design of HAD is presented and contrasted to RAP, LUB and HYBRID. Next, both an empirical and analytic analysis of HAD's performance are presented which show that HAD scales well. Finally, using the design differences of these algorithms, the performance of HAD is compared to RAP, LUB and HYBRID.
