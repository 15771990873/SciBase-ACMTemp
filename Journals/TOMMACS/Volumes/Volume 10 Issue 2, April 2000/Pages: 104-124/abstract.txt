This article presents a method for the computation of the equivalent bandwidth of an aggregate of heterogeneous self-similar sources, as well as the time scales of interest for queueing systems fed by a fractal Brownian motion (fBm) process. Moreover, the fractal leaky bucket, a novel policing mechanism capable of accurately monitoring self-similar sources, is introduced.
