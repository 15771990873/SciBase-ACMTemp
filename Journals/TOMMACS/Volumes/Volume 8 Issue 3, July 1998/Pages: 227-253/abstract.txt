We present a Markov chain Monte Carlo method for class throughputs in closed multiclass product-form networks. The method is as follows. For a given network, we construct a “regularized” network with a highly simplified structure that has the same steady-state distribution. We then simulate the regularized network. The method has performed reasonably well across a broad range of problems. We give a heuristic explanation of this and prove that the regularized network “mixes in polynomial time” in some special cases.
