Pseudorandom numbers are important ingredients of stochastic simulations. Their quality is fundamental for the strength of the simulation outcome. The inversive congruential method for generating uniform pseudorandom numbers is a particularly attractive alternative to linear congruential generators, which show many undesirable regularities. In the present paper a new inversive congruential generator with power of two modulus is introduced. Periodicity and statistical independence properties of the generated sequences are analyzed. The results show that these inversive congruential generators perform very satisfactorily.
