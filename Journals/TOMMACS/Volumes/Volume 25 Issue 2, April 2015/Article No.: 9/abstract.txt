The computation of transient probabilities for continuous-time Markov chains often employs uniformization, also known as the Jensen method. The fast adaptive uniformization method introduced by Mateescu et al. approximates the probability by neglecting insignificant states and has proven to be effective for quantitative analysis of stochastic models arising in chemical and biological applications. However, this method has only been formulated for the analysis of properties at a given point of timet. In this article, we extend fast adaptive uniformization to handle expected reward properties that reason about the model behavior until timet, for example, the expected number of chemical reactions that have occurred untilt. To show the feasibility of the approach, we integrate the method into the probabilistic model checker PRISM and apply it to a range of biological models. The performance of the method is enhanced by the use of interval splitting. We compare our implementation to standard uniformization implemented in PRISM and to fast adaptive uniformization without support for cumulative rewards implemented in MARCIE, demonstrating superior performance.
