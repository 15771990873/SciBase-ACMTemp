In this article, we present a new approach to assessing uniform random number generators, theweighted spectral test, ordiaphony. In contrast to the usualspectral testthe weighted spectral test is not limited to random number generators with a lattice structure. Its computational complexity isOs&dot;N2for any point set of cardinalityNin the s-dimensional unit cube. As the main results of this article, we prove an analog of the classical inequality of Erdös-Turán-Koksma, present the necessary tools to transcribe known discrepancy bounds into bounds for diaphony, and provide bounds for the diaphony  of multiplicative congruetial pseudorandom numbers. The last  section contains numerical results.\
