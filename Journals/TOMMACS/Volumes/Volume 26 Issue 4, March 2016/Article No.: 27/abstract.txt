“Automatic Moment-Closure Approximation of Spatially Distributed Collective Adaptive Systems” by Feng, Hilston, and Galpin presents detailed simulation analysis results for three models of spatially distributed collective adaptive systems. In this replicated computational results report, the corresponding implementation together with a documentation that was provided to the reviewer by the authors are considered. The software was installed, and new simulation results were generated and compared to the original results. The installation of the software did not result in any problems, and the comparison of the results yielded that the published results are replicable.
