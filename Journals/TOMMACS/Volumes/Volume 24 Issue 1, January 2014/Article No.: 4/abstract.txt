We describe the design and prototype implementation of Indemics(&lowbar;Interactive; Epi&lowbar;demic; &lowbar;Simulation;)â€”a modeling environment utilizing high-performance computing technologies for supporting complex epidemic simulations. Indemicscan support policy analysts and epidemiologists interested in planning and control of pandemics. Indemicsgoes beyond traditional epidemic simulations by providing a simple and powerful way to represent and analyze policy-based as well as individual-basedadaptive interventions. Users can also stop the simulation at any point, assess the state of the simulated system, and add additional interventions. Indemicsis available to end-users via a web-based interface.Detailed performance analysis shows that Indemicsgreatly enhances the capability and productivity of simulating complex intervention strategies with a marginal decrease in performance. We also demonstrate how Indemicswas applied in some real case studies where complex interventions were implemented.
