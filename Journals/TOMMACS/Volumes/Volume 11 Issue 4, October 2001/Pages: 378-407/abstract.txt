We present a cloning mechanism that enables the evaluation of multiple simulated futures. Performance of the mechanism is analyzed and evaluated experimentally on a shared memory multiprocessor. A running parallel discrete event simulation is dynamically cloned atdecision pointsto explore different execution paths concurrently. In this way, what-if and alternative scenario analysis can be performed in applications such as gaming or tactical and strategic battle management. A construct calledvirtual logical processesavoids repeating common computations among clones and improves efficiency. The advantages of cloning are preserved regardless of the number of clones (or execution paths). Our performance results with a commercial air traffic control simulation demonstrate that cloning can significantly reduce the time required to compute multiple alternate futures.
