This paper presents generalized feedback shift register (GFSR) generators with primitive polynomialsxp+xp-1+xq+xq-1+ 1. The recurrence of these generators can be efficiently computed. We adopt Fushimi's initialization scheme, which guarantees thek-distribution property. Statistical and timing results are presented.
