The Time Warp “optimistic” approach is one of the most important parallel simulation protocols. Time Warp synchronizes processes viarollback. The original rollback mechanism calledlazy cancellationhas aroused great interest. This paper studies these rollback mechanisms. The general tradeoffs between aggressive and lazy cancellation are discussed, and by a conservitive-optimal simulation is defined for comparitive purposes. Within the framework of aggressive cancellation, we offer some observations and analyze the rollback behavior of tandom systems. The lazy cancellation mechanism iss examined using a metric called thesensitivity of output message. Both aggressive and lazy cancellation are shown to work well for a process with a small simulated load intensity. Finally, an analytical model is given to analyzemessage preemtion, an important factor that affects the performance of rollback mechanisms. Results indicate that message preemtion has a significant effect on performance when (1) the processor is highly utilized, (2) the execution times of messages have high varience, and (3) rollbacks occur frequently.
