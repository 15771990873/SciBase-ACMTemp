We analyze properties associated with a simple yet effective way to exploit parallel processors in discrete event simulations: averaging the results of multiple, independent replications that are run, in parallel, on multiple processors. We focus on estimating expectations from terminating simulations, or steady state parameters from regenerative simulations. We assume that there is a CPU time constraint,t, on each ofPprocessors. Unless the replication lengths are bounded, one must be willing to simulate beyond any fixed, finite timeton at least some processors in order to always obtain a strongly consistent estimator (as the number of processors increases). We therefore consider simulation experiments in whichtis viewed as either     being a strict constraint, or a guideline, in which case simulation beyond timetis permitted. The statistical properties, including strong laws, central limit theorems, bias expansions, and completion time distributions of a variety of estimators obtainable from such an experiment are derived. We propose an unbiased estimator for a simple mean value. This estimator requires preselecting a fraction of the processors. Simulation beyond timetmay be required on a preselected processor, but only if no replications have yet been completed on that processor. being a strict constraint, or a guideline, in which case simulation beyond timetis permitted.
