The High Level Architecture (HLA) is an architecture for reuse and interoperation of simulations. It provides several Data Distribution Management (DDM) services to reduce the transmission and reception of irrelevant data. These services rely on the computation of the intersection between "update" and "subscription" regions. Currently, there are several main DDM filtering algorithms. Since each approach still has some shortcomings, we have focused our research on the design and the evaluation of intersection algorithms for the DDM. In this article, we introduce a new algorithm in which extents are sorted before computing the intersections. Our experiments show that usually the sort-based algorithm has the best performance among all approaches. The improvement of its performance ranges between 30% and 99% over the brute force and hybrid approaches.
