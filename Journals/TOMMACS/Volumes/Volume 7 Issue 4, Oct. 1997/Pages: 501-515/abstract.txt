We present a new concept for a system network to represent systems that are able to undergo structural change. Change in structure is defined in general terms, and includes the addition and deletion of systems and the modification of the relations among components. The structure of a system network is stored in the network executive. Any change in structure-related information is mapped into modifications in the network structure.Based on these concepts, we derive three new system specifications that provide a shorthand notation to specify classes of dynamic structure systems. These new formalisms are: dynamic structure discrete time system, dynamic structure differential equation specified systems, and dynamic structure discrete event system specification. We demonstrate  that these formalisms are closed under coupling, making hierarchical model construction possible. formalisms are described using set theoretic notation and general systems theory concepts.
