This article deals with the compound methods with modulusmfor generating uniform pseudorandom numbers, which have been introduced recently. Equidistribution and statistical independence properties of the generated sequences over part of the period are studied based on the discrepancy ofd-tuples of successive pseudorandom numbers. It is shown that there exist parameters in compound methods such that the discrepancy over part of the period of the corresponding point sets in thed-dimensional unit cube is of an order magnitude ofO(N-1/2(logN)d+3) for allN=1, â€¦,m. This result is applied to the compound nonlinear, inversive and explicit inversive congruential methods.
