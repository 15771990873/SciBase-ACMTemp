In this article we propose a new concept called automated container transportation system between inland port and terminals (ACTIPOT) which involves the use of automated trucks to transfer containers between an inland port and container terminals. The inland port is located a few miles away from the terminals and is used for storing and processing import/export containers before distribution to customers or transfer to the terminals. We design and analyze the ACTIPOT system with particular attention paid to the overall supervisory controller that synchronizes all the operations inside the ACTIPOT system. We employ the technique of truck platooning in order to simplify the control of the overall system and to minimize the possibility of deadlocks, congestion, and failures. A microscopic simulation model is developed and used to demonstrate the overall performance of the ACTIPOT system. The contribution of this article is the design, analysis, and evaluation of the new concept ACTIPOT.
