Consider a simulation estimatorα(c) based on expendingcunits of computer time to estimate a quantityα. In comparing competing estimators forα, a natural figure of merit is to choose the estimator that minimizes the computation time needed to reduce the error probabilityP(|α(c) −α| >ε) to below some prescribed valueδ. In this paper, we develop large deviations results that provide approximations to the computational budget necessary to reduce the error probability to belowδwhenδis small. This approximation depends critically on both the distribution of the estimator itself and that of the random amount of computer time required to generate the estimator, and leads to different conclusions regarding the choice of preferred estimator than those obtained when one requires the error toleranceεto be small. The “smallε” regime leads to variance-based selection criteria, and has a long history in the simulation literature going back to Hammersley and Handscomb.
