We review Propp and Wilson's [1996] CFTP algorithm and Wilson's [2000] ROCFTP algorithm. We then use these to construct perfect samplers for several queueing and network models: Poisson arrivals and exponential service times, several types of customers, and a trunk reservation protocol for accepting new customers; a similar protocol on a network switching model; a queue with a general arrival process; and a queue with both general arrivals and service times. Our samplers give effective ways to generate random samples from the steady-state distributions of these queues.
