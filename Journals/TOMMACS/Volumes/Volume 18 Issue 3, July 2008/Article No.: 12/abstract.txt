Switched Processing Systems (SPS) serve as canonical models in a wide area of applications such as high performance computing, wireless networking, call centers, and flexible manufacturing. In this article, we model the SPS by considering both slotted and continuous time and analyze it under fairly mild stochastic assumptions. Two classes of scheduling policies are introduced and shown to maximize the throughput and maintain strong stability of the system. In addition, their performance with respect to the average job sojourn time is examined by simulating small SPS subject to different types of input traffic. By utilizing the simulation result of the proposed policies, a hybrid control policy is constructed to reduce the average job sojourn time when the system has unknown and changing input loads.
