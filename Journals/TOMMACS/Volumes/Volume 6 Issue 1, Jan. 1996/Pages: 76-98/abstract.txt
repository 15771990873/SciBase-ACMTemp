A new perspective of the validation problemfor simulation models is formulated in this article. The approach is knowledge-based and focuses on behavioral validation. It has the important feature of providing a basis for the development of a software environment that can automate the validation activity. Discrete, continuous and combined simulation models can be treated in a uniform manner.The key element of the approach is a validation knowledge base (VKB). This is developed as three disjoint sets of relationships among the input and output variables of the simulation model. These relationships serve to capture all aspects of expected behavior of the simulation model. A simple characterization of model behavior is presented which provides the basis for specifying the relationships from which the VKB is constructedThe utilization of all the information in the VKB in an efficient way is an important subgoal of our system architecture. This requirement gives rise to an experiment design problem. This problem is carefully formulated and examined within the framework of the behavior characterizations that exist in the VKB. In particular, a basis for its solution is established in a constraint set framework by carrying out a transformation on the relationships within the VKB. The constraint set context for the problem has the advantage of providing an environment which not only facilitates analysis but also enables the application of a variety of solution techniques.
