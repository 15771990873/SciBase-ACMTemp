Recently, several nonlinear congruential methods for generating uniform pseudorandom numbers have been proposed and analysed. In the present note, further statistical independence properties of a general class of nonlinear congruential pseudorandom number generators are established. The results that are obtained are essentially best possible in an asymptotic sense and show that the generated pseudorandom numbers model truly random numbers very closely in terms of asymptotic discrepancy.
