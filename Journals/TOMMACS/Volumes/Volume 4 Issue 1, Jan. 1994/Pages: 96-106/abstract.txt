The one-dimensional distribution of pseudorandom numbers generated by the ratio of uniforms method using linear congruential generators (LCGs) as the source of uniform random number is investigated in this note. Due to the two-dimensional lattice structure of LCGs there is always a comparable large gap without a point in the one-dimensional distribution of any ratio of uniforms method. Lower bounds for these probabilities only depending on the modulus and the Beyer quotient of the LCG are proved for the case that Cauchy normal or exponential random numbers are generated. These bounds justify the recommendation not to use the ratio of uniform method combined with LCGs.
