We propose a system of multiple recursive generators of moduluspand orderkwhere all nonzero coefficients of the recurrence are equal. The advantage of this property is that a single multiplication is needed to compute the recurrence, so the generator would run faster than the general case. Forp= 231− 1, the most popular modulus used, we provide tables of specific parameter values yielding maximum period for recurrence of orderk= 102 and 120. Forp= 231− 55719 andk= 1511, we have found generators with a period length approximately 1014100.5.
