Eliminating the boundary effects is an important issue for a large-scale personal communication service (PCS) network simulation. A PCS network is often modeled by a network of hexagonal cells. The boundary may significantly bias the ouput statistics if the number of hexagonal cells is small in a PCS network simulation. On the other hand, if the simulation is to be completed within a reasonable time on the available computing resources, the number of cells in the simulation cannot be too large. To avoid the inaccuracy caused by the boundary effect for a PCS network simulation with limited computing resources, we propose wrapping the hexagonal mesh into a homogeneous graph (i.e., all nodes in the graph are topologically identical). We show that by using the wrapped hexagonal mesh, the inaccuracy of the output measures can be limited even though the number of cells in the simulation is small. We can thus obtain the same statistical accuracy while using significantly less computation power than required for a simulation without cell wrapping.
