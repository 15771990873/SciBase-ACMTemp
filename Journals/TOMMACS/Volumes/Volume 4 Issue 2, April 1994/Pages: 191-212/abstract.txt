Pseudorandom vectors are of importance for parallelized simulation methods. In this article we carry out a detailed analysis of the inversive method for the generation of uniform pseudorandom vectors. This method can be viewed as an analog of the inversive congruential method for pseudorandom number generation. We study, in particular, the periodicity properties and the behavior under the serial test for sequences of pseudorandom vectors generated by the inversive method.
