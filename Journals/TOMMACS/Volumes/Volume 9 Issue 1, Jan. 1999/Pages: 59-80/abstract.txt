We report on both theoretical developments and comutational experience  with thepatchwork rejectiontechnique in Zechner and Stadlober [1993] and Zechner [1997]. The basic approach is due to Minh [1988], who suggested a special sampling method for the gamma distribution. The method's general objective is to rearrange the area below the density of histogramf(x) in the body of the distribution by certain point reflections such that variates may be generated efficiently within a large center interval. This is carried out via uniform hat functions, combined with minorizing rectangles for immediate acceptance of one transformed uniform deviate. The remaining tails off(x) are covered by exponential    functions. Experiments show that  patchwork rejection algorithms are in general faster than their competitors at the cost of higher set-up times.
