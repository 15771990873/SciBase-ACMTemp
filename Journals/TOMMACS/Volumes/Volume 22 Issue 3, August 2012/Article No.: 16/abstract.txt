For many discrete simulation optimization applications, it is often difficult to decide which Ranking and Selection (R&S;) procedure to use. To efficiently compare R&S; procedures, we present a three-layer performance evaluation process. We show that the two most popular performance formulations, namely the Bayesian formulation and the indifference zone formulation, have a common representation analogous to convex risk measures used in mathematical finance. We then specify how a decision maker can impose a performance requirement on R&S; procedures that is more adequate for her risk attitude than the indifference zone or the Bayesian performance requirements. Such a performance requirement partitions the space of R&S; procedures into acceptable and nonacceptable procedures. The minimal computational budget required for a procedure to become acceptable introduces an easy-to-interpret preference order on the set of R&S; policies. We demonstrate with a numerical example how the introduced framework can be used to guide the choice of selection procedure in practice.
