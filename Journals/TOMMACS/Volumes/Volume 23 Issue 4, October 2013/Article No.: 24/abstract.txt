The classicalactivity cycle diagram(ACD), which is a bipartite directed graph, is easy to learn and use for describing the dynamic behavior of adiscrete-event system. However, the complexity of the classical ACD model increases rapidly as the system size increases. This article presents an enriched ACD called theparameterizedACD (P-ACD). In P-ACD, each node is allowed to haveparameter variables, andparameter valuesare passed to the parameter variables through adirected arc. This article demonstrates how asingleP-ACD model can be used to represent an entireclassof very large-scale systems instead of requiringdifferentACD models for everyinstance. We also illustrate that the well-known activity scanning algorithm can be used to execute a P-ACD model. A prototype P-ACD simulator implemented in C&num; programming language is provided, and an illustrative example of a conveyor-driven serial production line with the prototype simulator is presented to illustrate construction and execution of a P-ACD model. In addition, it is demonstrated that the proposed P-ACD allows an effective and concise modeling of a job shop, which was not possible with the classical ACD.
