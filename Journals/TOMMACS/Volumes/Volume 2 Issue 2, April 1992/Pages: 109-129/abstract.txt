A formal definition of the process interaction world view is reviewed. A shortcoming of this world view is identified with respect to modularity and encapsulation. A modification of the world view that supports modularity and encapsulation is presented, and its advantages are discussed. It is shown how some recent process-oriented simulation languages support this modified world view. The impact of this modification on parallel simulation is discussed, and the modified world view is briefly compared to the use of object-oriented simulation modeling.
