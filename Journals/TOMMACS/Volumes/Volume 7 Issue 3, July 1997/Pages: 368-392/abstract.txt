Simulations that run at multiple levels of resolution often encounter consistency problems because of insufficient correlation between the attributes at multiple levels of the same entity. Inconsistency may occur despite the existence of valid models at each resolution level. Cross-Resolution Modeling (CRM) attempts to build effective multiresolution simulations. The traditional approach to CRM—aggregation-disaggregation—causes chain disaggregation and puts an unacceptable burden on resources. We present four fundamental observations that would help guide future approaches to CRM. These observations form the basis of an approach we propose that involves the design of Multiple Resolution Entities (MREs). MREs are the foundation of a design that incorporates maintaining  internal consistency. We also propose maintenance of core attributes as an approach to maintaining internal consistency within an MRE..
