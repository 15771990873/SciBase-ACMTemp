This article deals with the inversive method for generating uniform pseudorandom vectors. Statistical independence properties of the generated pseudorandom vector sequences over parts of the period are considered based on the discrete discrepancy of corresponding point sets. An upper bound for the average value of these discrete discrepancies is established.
