Simulation is an important tool for comparing the performance of several alternative systems. There is therefore significant interest in procedures that efficiently select the best system, where best is defined by the maximum or minimum expected simulation output. In this paper, we examine both two-stage and sequential procedures that represent three structurally different modeling methodologies for allocating simulation replications to identify the best system, and we evaluate them empirically with respect to several measures of effectiveness. Empirical evidence suggests that sequential procedures perform better than their two-stage counterparts, including a heuristic sequential variation on Rinott's procedure. Further, there appears to be significant benefit to using procedures  based on a Bayesian, average-case analysis as opposed to the statistically-conservative indifference-zone formulation.
