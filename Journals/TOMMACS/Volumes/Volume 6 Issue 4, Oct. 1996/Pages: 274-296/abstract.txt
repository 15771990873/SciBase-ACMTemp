One popular family of low dicrepancy sets is the (t, m, s)-nets. Recently a randomization of these nets that preserves their net property has been introduced. In this article a formula for the mean squareL2-discrepancy of (0, m, s)-nets in basebis derived. This formula has a computational complexity of only O(s log(N) + s2) for largeNor s, whereN = bmis the number of points. Moreover, the root mean squareL2-discrepancy of (0, m, s)-nets is show to be O(N-1[log(N)](s-1)/2) asNtends to infinity, the same asymptotic order as the known lower bound for  theL2-discrepancy of an arbitrary set.
