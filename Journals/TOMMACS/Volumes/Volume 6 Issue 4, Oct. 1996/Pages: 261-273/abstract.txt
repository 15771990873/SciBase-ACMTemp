Empirical testing of computer generated pseudo-random sequences is widely practiced. Extensions to thecoupon collector'sandgaptests are presented that examine the distribution and independence of radix-bdigit patterns in sequences with modulo of the formbw. An algorithm is given and the test is applied to a number of popular generators. Theoretical expected values are derived for a number of defects that may be present in a pseudorandom sequence and additional empirical evidence is given to support these values. The test has a simple model and a known distribution function. It is easily and efficiently implemented and easily adaptable to testing only the bits of interest, griven a certain application.
