Nonconventional parallel simulations methods are presented, wherein speed-ups are not limited by the number of simulated components. The methods capitalize on Chandy and Sherman's space-time relaxation paradigm, and incorporate fast algorithms for solving recurrences. Special attention is paid to implementing these algorithms on currently available massively parallel SIMD computers. As examples, “superfast” simulations for open and closed queuing networks and for the slotted ALOHA communication protocol are discussed. Several of the simulations are implemented and show impressive computational speeds. This paper summarizes previous results of the authors and presents some new experiments and simulations.
