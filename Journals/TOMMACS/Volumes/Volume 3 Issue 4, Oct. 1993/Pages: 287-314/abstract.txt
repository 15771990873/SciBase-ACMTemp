Synchronous relaxation, a new, general-purpose, efficient method for parallel simulation, is proposed. The method is applied to obtain a new parallel algorithm for simulating large circuit-switched communication networks. To show that synchronous-relaxation method is efficient, we present the results of circuit-switched network simulation experiments, and analytic approximations derived from a mathematical model of the simulation method.
