When simulating queues in heavy traffic, estimators of quantities such as average delay in queuedconverge slowly to their true values. This problem is exacerbated when interarrival and service distributions are irregular. For theGI/G/1 queue, delay moments can be expressed in terms of moments of idle periodI. Instead of estimatingddirectly by a standard regenerative estimator that we call DD, a method we call DI estimatesdfrom estimated moments ofI. DI was investigated some time ago and shown to be much more efficient than DD in heavy traffic. We measureefficiencyas the factor by which variance is reduced. For theGI/G/1 queue, we show how to generate a sequence of realized values of theequilibriumidle period,Ie, that are not independent and identically distributed, but have the correct statistical properties in the long run. We show how to use this sequence to construct a new estimator ofd, called DE, and of higher moments of delay as well. When arrivals are irregular, we show that DE is more efficient than DI, in some cases by a large factor,independent of the traffic intensity. Comparing DE with DD, these factorsmultiply. ForGI/G/c, we construct a control-variates estimator of average delay in queuedcthat is efficient in heavy traffic. It uses DE to estimate the average delay for the corresponding fast single server. We compare the efficiency of this method with another method in the literature. ForM/G/c, we use insensitivity to construct another control-variates estimator ofdc. We compare the efficiency of this estimator with the two c-server estimators above.
