We describe an approach and our experiences in applying federated simulation techniques to create large-scale parallel simulations of computer networks. Using the federated approach, the topology and the protocol stack of the simulated network is partitioned into a number of submodels, and a simulation process is instantiated for each one. Runtime infrastructure software provides services for interprocess communication and synchronization (time management). We first describe issues that arise inhomogeneousfederations where a sequential simulator is federated with itself to realize a parallel implementation. We then describe additional issues that must be addressed inheterogeneousfederations composed of different network simulation packages, and describe adynamic simulation backplanemechanism that facilitates interoperability amongdifferentnetwork simulators. Specifically, thedynamic simulation backplaneprovides a means of addressing key issues that arise in federating different network simulators: differing packet representations, incomplete implementations of network protocol models, and differing levels of detail among the simulation processes. We discuss two different methods for using the backplane for interactions between heterogeneous simulators: thecross-protocol stackmethod and thesplit-protocol stackmethod. Finally, results from an experimental study are presented for both the homogeneous and heterogeneous cases that provide evidence of the scalability of our federated approach on two moderately sized computing clusters. Two different homogeneous implementations are described:Parallel/Distributed ns(pdns) and theGeorgia Tech Network Simulator(GTNetS). Results of a heterogeneous implementation federatingnswithGloMoSimare described. This research demonstrates that federated simulations are a viable approach to realizing efficient parallel network simulation tools.
