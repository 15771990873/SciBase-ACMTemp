The twisted GFSR generators proposed in a previous article have a defect ink-distribution forklarger than the order of recurrence. In this follow up article, we introduce and analyze a new TGFSR variant having betterk-distribution property. We provide an efficient algorithm to obtain the order of equidistribution, together with a tight upper bound on the order. We discuss a method to search for generators attaining this bound, and we list some of these such generators. The upper bound turns out to be (sometimes far) less than the maximum order of equidistribution for a generator of that period length, but far more than that for a GFSR with a working are of the same size.
