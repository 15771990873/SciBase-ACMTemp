AnO(n3)algorithm is described to count triangulations of a simple polygon withnvertices. This algorithm is used to construct anO(n4)algorithm to generate triangulations of a simple polygon at random with a uniform probability distribution. The problem of counting triangulations of a simple polygon is then related to existing problems in graph theory.
