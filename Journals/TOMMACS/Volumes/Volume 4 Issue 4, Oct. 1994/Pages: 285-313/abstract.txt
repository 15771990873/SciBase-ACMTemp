This article deals with simulation of approximate models of dynamic systems. We propose an approach that is appropriate when the uncertainty intrinsic in some models cannot be reduced by traditional identification techniques, due to the impossibility of gathering experimental data about the system itself. The article presents a methodology for qualitative modeling and simulation of approximately known systems. The proposed solution is based on the Fuzzy Sets theory, extending the power of traditional numerical-logical methods. We have implemented a fuzzy simulator that integrates a fuzzy, qualitative approach and traditional, quantitative methods.
