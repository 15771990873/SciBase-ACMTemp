A graphical interactive technique for modeling bivariate simulation inputs is based on a family of continuous univariate and bivariate probability distributions with bounded support that are described by BeÂ´zier curves and surfaces, respectively. This family of distributions has a natural, extensible parameterization so that all parameters have a meaningful interpretation; and the complete family is capable of accurately representing an unlimited variety of shapes for marginal distributions together with many common types of bivariate stochastic dependence. This approach to simulation input modeling is implemented in a Windows-based software system called PRIME-PRobabilistic Input Modeling Environment. Several examples illustrate the application of PRIME to subjective and  data-driven estimation of bivariate distributions representing simulation inputs.
