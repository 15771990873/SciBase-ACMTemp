Lindley's recursion is an explicit recursive equation that describes the recursive relationship between consecutive waiting times in a single-stage single-server queue. In this paper, we develop explicit recursive representations for multiserver tandem queues with blocking. We demonstrate the application of these recursive representations with simulations of large-scale tandem queueing networks. We compare the computational efficiency of these representations with two other popular discrete-event simulation approaches, namely, event scheduling and process interaction. Experimental results show that these representations are seven (or more) times faster than their counterparts based on the event-scheduling and process-interaction approaches.
