Maintaining a consistent view of the simulated world among different simulation nodes is a fundamental problem in large-scale distributed virtual environments (DVEs). In this paper, we characterize this problem by quantifying the time-space inconsistency in a DVE. To this end, a metric is defined to measure the time-space inconsistency in a DVE. One major advantage of the metric is that it may be estimated based on some characteristic parameters of a DVE, such as clock asynchrony, message transmission delay, the accuracy of the dead reckoning algorithm, the kinetics of the moving entity, and human factors. Thus the metric can be used to evaluate the time-space consistency property of a DVE without the actual execution of the DVE application, which is especially useful in the design stage of a DVE. Our work also clearly shows how the characteristic parameters of a DVE are interrelated in deciding the time-space inconsistency, so that we may fine-tune the DVE to make it as consistent as possible. To verify the effectiveness of the metric, a Ping-Pong game is developed. Experimental results show that the metric is effective in evaluating the time-space consistency property of the game.
