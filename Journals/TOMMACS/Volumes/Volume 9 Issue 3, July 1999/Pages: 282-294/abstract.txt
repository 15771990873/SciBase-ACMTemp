We consider the impact of discarding and tempering on modern huge period high speed linear generators, and illustrate how a simple strategy yields unexpected &mdashh; and unwanted â€” success in a fair coin gambling which is simulated by a recently proposed generator. It becomes  clear that discarding is no general rule to get rid of unwanted correlations.
