In optimistic parallel simulations, state-saving techniques have traditionally been used to realize rollback. In this article, we proposereverse computationas an alternative approach, and compare its execution performance against that of state-saving. Using compiler techniques, we describe an approach to automatically generate reversible computations, and to optimize them to reap the performance benefits of reverse computation transparently. For certain fine-grain models, such as queuing network models, we show that reverse computation can yield significant improvement in execution speed coupled with significant reduction in memory utilization, as compared to traditional state-saving. On sample models using reverse computation, we observe as much as a six-fold  improvement in execution  speed over traditional state-saving.
