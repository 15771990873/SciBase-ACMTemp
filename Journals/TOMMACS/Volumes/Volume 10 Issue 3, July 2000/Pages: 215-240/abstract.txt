In this paper we develop and implement a simulation modeling methodology that combines discrete event simulation with qualitive simulation. Our main reason for doing so is to extend the application of discrete event simulation to systems found in business for which precise quantitative information is lacking. The approach discussed in this paper is the implementation of temporal interval specifications in the discrete event model and the construction of a temporal interval clock for the qualitative simulation model.
