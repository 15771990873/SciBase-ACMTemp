A high-level simulation language based on temporal logic is described. The language combines a large set of temporal tenses and a rich class of high-level modeling primitives. Also an implementation of the language interpreter is presented. Finally, a real-world case study is described that shows how a programmer can develop structured, reliable, and well-maintainable simulation programs using the language.
