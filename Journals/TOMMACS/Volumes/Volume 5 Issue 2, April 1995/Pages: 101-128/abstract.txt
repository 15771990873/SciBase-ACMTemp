The design and analysis of multiprocessor simulation models represents a complex and computationally demanding application that is a candidate for parallel simulation. This paper examines the application of conservative parallel discrete event simulation on a set of existing “real-world” models created over the years with no thought given to the parallel execution. These models are based on a subset of Petri Nets known asMarked graphs. The results of the study of the transparent and automatic parallel execution of the simulation of these models will be presented. Focus will be on the amount of inherent parallelism in such models, means of exploiting it, obstacles prohibiting parallelization, and sensitivity to different system and model parameters.
