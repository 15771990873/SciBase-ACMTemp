Metamodeling is one of the core foundations of computer-automated multiparadigm modeling. However, there is currently little agreement about what form the required metamodeling approach should take and precisely what role metamodels should play. This article addresses the problem by first describing some fundamental problems in the industry's leading metamodeling technology, the UML framework, and then explaining how this framework could be rearchitected to overcome these problems. Three main issues are identified in the current framework: thedual classificationproblem arising from the need to capture both the logical and physical classification of model elements, theclass/object dualityproblem arising from the need to capture both the classlike and objectlike facets of some model elements, and thereplication of conceptsproblem arising from the need to define certain concepts multiple times. Three main proposals for rearchitecting the UML framework to overcome these problems are then presented: the separation of logical and physical classification dimensions, the unification of the class and object facets of model elements, and the enhancement of the instantiation mechanism to allow definitions to transcend multiple levels. The article concludes with a discussion of other practical issues involved in rearchitecting the UML modeling framework in the proposed way.
