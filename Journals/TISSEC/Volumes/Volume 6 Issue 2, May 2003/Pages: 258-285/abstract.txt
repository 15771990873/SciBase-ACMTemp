We describe a novel method for authenticating multicast packets that is robust against packet loss. Our focus is to minimize the size of the communication overhead required to authenticate the packets. Our approach is to encode the hash values and the signatures with Rabin's Information Dispersal Algorithm (IDA) to construct an authentication scheme that amortizes a single signature operation over multiple packets. This strategy is especially efficient in terms of space overhead, because just the essential elements needed for authentication (i.e., one hash per packet and one signature per group of packets) are used in conjunction with an erasure code that is space optimal. Using asymptotic techniques, we derive the authentication probability of our scheme using two different bursty loss models. A lower bound of the authentication probability is also derived for one of the loss models. To evaluate the performance of our scheme, we compare our technique with four other previously proposed schemes using empirical results.
