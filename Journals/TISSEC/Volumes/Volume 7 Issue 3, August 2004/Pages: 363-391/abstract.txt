In large organizations the administration of access privileges (such as the assignment of access rights to a user in a particular role) is handled cooperatively through distributed administrators in various different capacities. A quorum may be necessary, or a veto may be possible for such a decision. In this paper, we present two major contributions: We develop arole-based access control(RBAC) approach for specifying distributed administration requirements, and procedures between administrators, or administration teams, extending earlier work on distributed (modular) authorization. While a comprehensive specification in such a language is conceivable it would be quite tedious to evaluate, or analyze, their operational aspects and properties in practice. For this reason we create a new class of extended Petri Nets called Administration Nets (Adm-Nets) such that any RBAC specification of (cooperative) administration requirements (given in terms of predicate logic formulas) can be embedded into an Adm-Net. This net behaves within the constraints specified by the logical formulas, and at the same time, itexplicitlyexhibits all needed operational details such as allowing for an efficient and comprehensive formal analysis of administrative behavior. We introduce the new concepts and illustrate their use in several examples. While Adm-Nets are much more refined and (behaviorally) explicit than workflow systems our work provides for a constructive step towards novel workflow management tools as well. We demonstrate the usefulness of Adm-Nets by modeling typical examples of administration processes concerned with sets of distributed authorization rules.
