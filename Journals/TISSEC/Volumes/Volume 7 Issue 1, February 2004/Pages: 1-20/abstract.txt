This paper presents a new simple schemes for verifiable encryption of digital signatures. We make use of a trusted third party (TTP) but in anoptimisticsense, that is, the TTP takes part in the protocol only if one user cheats or simply crashes. Our schemes can be used as primitives to build efficient fair exchange and certified e-mail protocols.
