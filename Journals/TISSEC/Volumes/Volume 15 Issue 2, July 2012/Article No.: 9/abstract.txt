Audit logs are an integral part of modern computer systems due to their forensic value. Protecting audit logs on a physically unprotected machine in hostile environments is a challenging task, especially in the presence of active adversaries. It is critical for such a system to haveforward securityandappend-onlyproperties such that when an adversary compromises a logging machine, she cannot forge or selectively delete the log entries accumulated before the compromise. Existing public-key-based secure logging schemes are computationally costly. Existing symmetric secure logging schemes are not publicly verifiable and open to certain attacks.In this article, we develop a new forward-secure and aggregate signature scheme calledBlind-Aggregate-Forward (BAF), which is suitable for secure logging in resource-constrained systems. BAF is the only cryptographic secure logging scheme that can produce publicly verifiable, forward-secure and aggregate signatures withlow computation, key/signature storage, and signature communication overheads for the loggers, without requiring any online trusted third party support. A simple variant of BAF also allows a fine-grained verification of log entries without compromising the security or computational efficiency of BAF. We prove that our schemes are secure in Random Oracle Model (ROM). We also show that they are significantly more efficient than all the previous publicly verifiable cryptographic secure logging schemes.
