Authentication using a path of trusted intermediaries, each able to authenicate the next in the path, is a well-known technique for authenicating entities in a large-scale system. Recent work has extended this technique to include multiple paths in an effort to bolster authentication, but the success of this approach may be unclear in the face of intersecting paths, ambiguities in the meaning of certificates, and interdependencies in the use of different keys. Thus, several authors have proposed metrics to evaluate the confidence afforded by a set of paths. In this paper we develop a set of guiding principles for the design of such metrics. We motivate our principles by showing how previous approaches failed with respect to these principles and what the consequences to authentication might be. We then propose a new metric that appears to meet our principles, and so to be a satisfactory metric of authenticaiton.
