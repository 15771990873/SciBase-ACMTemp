Modern day enterprises exhibit a growing trend toward adoption of enterprise computing services for efficient resource utilization, scalability, and flexibility. These environments are characterized by heterogeneous, distributed computing systems exchanging enormous volumes of time-critical data with varying levels of access control in a dynamic business environment. The enterprises are thus faced with significant challenges as they endeavor to achieve their primary goals, and simultaneously ensure enterprise-wide secure interoperation among the various collaborating entities. Key among these challenges are providing effective mechanism for enforcement of enterprise policy across distributed domains, ensuring secure content-based access to enterprise resources at all user levels, and allowing the specification of temporal and nontemporal context conditions to support fine-grained dynamic access control. In this paper, we investigate these challenges, and present X-GTRBAC, an XML-based GTRBAC policy specification language and its implementation for enforcing enterprise-wide access control. Our specification language is based on the GTRBAC model that incorporates the content- and context-aware dynamic access control requirements of an enterprise. An X-GTRBAC system has been implemented as a Java application. We discuss the salient features of the specification language, and present the software architecture of our system. A comprehensive example is included to discuss and motivate the applicability of the X-GTRBAC framework to a generic enterprise environment. An application level interface for implementing the policy in the X-GTRBAC system is also provided to consolidate the ideas presented in the paper.
