In recent years, workflow management systems (WFMSs) have gained popularity in both research and commercial sectors. WFMSs are used to coordinate and streamline business processes. Very large WFMSs are often used in organizations with users in the range of several thousands and process instances in the range of tens and thousands. To simplify the complexity of security administration, it is common practice in many businesses to allocate a role for each activity in the process and then assign one or more users to each roleâ€”granting an authorization to roles rather than to users. Typically, security policies are expressed as constraints (or rules) on users and roles;separation of dutiesis a well-known constraint. Unfortunately, current role-based access control  models are not adequate to model such constraints. To address this issue we (1) present a language to express both static and dynamic authorization constraints as clauses in a logic program; (2) provide formal notions of constraint consistency; and (3) propose algorithms to check the consistency of constraints and assign users and roles to tasks that constitute the workflow in such a way that no constraints are violated.
