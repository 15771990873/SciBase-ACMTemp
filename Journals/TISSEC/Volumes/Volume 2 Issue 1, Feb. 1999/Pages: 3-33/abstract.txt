We describe in more detail than before the reference model for role-based access control introduced by Nyanchama and Osborn, and the role-graph model with its accompanying algorithms, which is one way of implementing role-role relationships. An alternative role insertion algorithm is added, and it is shown how the role creation policies of Fernandez et al. correspond to role addition algorithms in our model. We then use our reference model to provide a taxonomy for kinds of conflict. We then go on to consider in some detail privilege-privilege and and role-role conflicts in conjunction with the role graph model. We show how role-role conflicts lead to a partitioning of the role graph into nonconflicting collections that can together be safely authorized to a given user. Finally, in  an appendix, we present the role graph algorithms with additional logic to disallow roles that contain conflicting privileges.
