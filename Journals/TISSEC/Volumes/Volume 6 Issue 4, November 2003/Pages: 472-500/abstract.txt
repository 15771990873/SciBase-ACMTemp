In this paper we study privacy issues regarding the use of the SSL/TLS protocol and X.509 certificates. Our main attention is placed on subscription-based remote services (e.g., subscription to newspapers and databases) where the service manager charges a flat fee for a period of time independent of the actual number of times the service is requested.We start by pointing out that restricting the access to such services by using X.509 certificates and the SSL/TLS protocol, while preserving the interests of the service managers, neglects the right to privacy of the users.We then propose the concept of acrypto certificateand the Secure andPrivateSocket Layer protocol (SPSL protocol, in short) and show how they can be used to preserve user privacy and, at the same time, protecting the interests of the service managers. The SPSL protocol only requires the user to have astandardX.509 certificate (with an RSA key) and does not require the user to get any special ad hoc certificate.Finally, we show the viability of the proposed solution by describing a system based on SPSL for secure and private access to subscription-based web services. Our implementation includes an SPSL proxy for a TLS-enabled web client and a module for the Apache web server along with administrative tools for the server side. The system has been developed starting from the implementation of an API for the SPSL protocol that we describe in the paper.
