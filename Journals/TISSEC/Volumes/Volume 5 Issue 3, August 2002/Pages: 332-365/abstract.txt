Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is supported directly or in a closely related form, by a number of products. This article presents a formalization of RBAC using graph transformations that is a graphical specification technique based on a generalization of classical string grammars to nonlinear structures. The proposed formalization provides an intuitive description for the manipulation of graph structures as they occur in information systems access control and a precise specification of static and dynamic consistency conditions on graphs and graph transformations. The formalism captures the RBAC models published in the literature, and also allows a uniform treatment of user roles and administrative roles, and a detailed analysis of the decentralization of administrative roles.
