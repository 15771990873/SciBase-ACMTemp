Unlike other access control systems based on biometric features, keystroke analysis has not led to techniques providing an acceptable level of accuracy. The reason is probably the intrinsic variability of typing dynamics, versus other---very stable---biometric characteristics, such as face or fingerprint patterns. In this paper we present an original measure for keystroke dynamics that limits the instability of this biometric feature. We have tested our approach on 154 individuals, achieving a False Alarm Rate of about 4&percnt; and an Impostor Pass Rate of less than 0.01&percnt;. This performance is reached using the same sampling text for all the individuals, allowing typing errors, without any specific tailoring of the authentication system with respect to the available set of typing samples and users, and collecting the samples over a 28.8-Kbaud remote modem connection.
