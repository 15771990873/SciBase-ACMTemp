Aggregator-oblivious encryption is a useful notion put forward by Shi et al. in 2011 that allows an untrusted aggregator to periodically compute an aggregate value over encrypted data contributed by a set of users. Such encryption schemes find numerous applications, particularly in the context of privacy-preserving smart metering.This article presents a general framework for constructing privacy-preserving aggregator-oblivious encryption schemes using a variant of Cramer-Shoupâ€™s paradigm of smooth projective hashing. This abstraction leads to new schemes based on a variety of complexity assumptions. It also improves upon existing constructions, providing schemes with shorter ciphertexts and better encryption times.
