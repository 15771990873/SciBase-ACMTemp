Access control policies for XML typically use regular path expressions such as XPath for specifying the objects for access-control policies. However such access-control policies are burdens to the query engines for XML documents. To relieve this burden, we introduce static analysis for XML access-control. Given an access-control policy, query expression, and an optional schema, static analysis determines if this query expression is guaranteed not to access elements or attributes that are hidden by the access-control policy but permitted by the schema. Static analysis can be performed without evaluating any query expression against actual XML documents. Run-time checking is required only when static analysis is unable to determine whether to grant or deny access requests. A side effect of static analysis is query optimization: access-denied expressions in queries can be evaluated to empty lists at compile time. We further extend static analysis for handling value-based access-control policies and introduce view schemas.
