We introduce a decentralized delegation model called anonymous role-based cascaded delegation. In this model, a delegator can issue authorizations on behalf of her role without revealing her identity. This type of delegation protects the sensitive membership information of a delegator and hides the internal structure of an organization. To provide an efficient storage and transmission mechanism for credentials used in anonymous role-based cascaded delegation, we present a new digital signature scheme that supports both signer anonymity and signature aggregation. Our scheme has compact role signatures that make it especially suitable for ubiquitous computing environments, where users may have mobile computing devices with narrow communication bandwidth and small storage units.
