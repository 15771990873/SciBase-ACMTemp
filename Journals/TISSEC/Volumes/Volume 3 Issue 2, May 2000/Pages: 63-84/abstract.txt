We examine the problem of efficient anonymous multicast and reception in general communication networks. We present algorithms that achieve anonymous communication, are protected against traffic analysis, and requireO(1) amortized communication complexity on each link and low computational comlexity. The algorithms support sender anonymity, receiver(s) anonymity, or sender-receiver anonymity.
