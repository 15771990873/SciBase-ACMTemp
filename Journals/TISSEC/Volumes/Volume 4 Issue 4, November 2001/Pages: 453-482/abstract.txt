Public key management has received considerable attention from both the research and commercial communities as a useful primitive for secure electronic commerce and secure communication. While the mechanics of certifying and revoking public keys and escrowing and recovering private keys have been widely explored, less attention has been paid to access control frameworks for regulating access to stored keys by different parties. In this article we propose such a framework for a key management service that supports public key registration, lookup, and revocation, and private key escrow, protected use (e.g., to decrypt selected messages), and recovery. We propose an access control model using a policy based on principal, ownership, and authority relationships on keys. The model allows owners to grant to others (and revoke) privileges to execute various actions on their keys. The simple authorization language is very expressive, enabling the specification of authorizations for composite subjects that can be fully specified (ground) or partially specified, thus making the authorizations applicable to all subjects satisfying some conditions. We illustrate how the access control policy and the authorizations can easily be expressed through a simple and restricted, hence efficiently computable, form of logic language.
