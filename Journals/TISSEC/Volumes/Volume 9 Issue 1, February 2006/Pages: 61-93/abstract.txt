Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are used to detect traces of malicious activities targeted against the network and its resources. Anomaly-based IDSs build models of the expected behavior of applications by analyzing events that are generated during the applications' normal operation. Once these models have been established, subsequent events are analyzed to identify deviations, on the assumption that anomalies represent evidence of an attack. Host-based anomaly detection systems often rely on system call sequences to characterize the normal behavior of applications. Recently, it has been shown how these systems can be evaded by launching attacks that execute legitimate system call sequences. The evasion is possible because existing techniques do not take into account all available features of system calls. In particular, system call arguments are not considered. We propose two primary improvements upon existing host-based anomaly detectors. First, we apply multiple detection models to system call arguments. Multiple models allow the arguments of each system call invocation to be evaluated from several different perspectives. Second, we introduce a sophisticated method of combining the anomaly scores from each model into an overall aggregate score. The combined anomaly score determines whether an event is part of an attack. Individual anomaly scores are often contradicting and, therefore, a simple weighted sum cannot deliver reliable results. To address this problem, we propose a technique that uses Bayesian networks to perform system call classification. We show that the analysis of system call arguments and the use of Bayesian classification improves detection accuracy and resilience against evasion attempts. In addition, the paper describes a tool based on our approach and provides a quantitative evaluation of its performance in terms of both detection effectiveness and overhead. A comparison with four related approaches is also presented.
