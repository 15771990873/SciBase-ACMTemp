Minimizing power consumption is crucial in battery power-limited secure wireless mobile networks. In this paper, we (a) introduce a hardware/software set-up to measure the battery power consumption of encryption algorithms through real-life experimentation, (b) based on the profiled data, propose mathematical models to capture the relationships between power consumption and security, and (c) formulate and solve security maximization subject to power constraints. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the gains that can be achieved in using solutions of the proposed security maximization problems subject to power constraints.
