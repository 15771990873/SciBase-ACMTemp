Keystroke dynamics can be useful to ascertain personal identity evenafteran authentication phase has been passed, provided that we are able to deal with the typing rhythms of free text, chosen and entered by users without any specific constraint. In this paper we present a method to compare typing samples of free text that can be used to verify personal identity. We have tested our technique with a wide set of experiments on 205 individuals, obtaining a False Alarm Rate of less than 5&percent; and an Impostor Pass Rate of less than 0.005&percent;. Different trade-offs are, however, possible. Our approach can rely on what is typed by people because of their normal job, and a few lines of text, even collected in different working sessions, are sufficient to reach a high level of accuracy, which improves proportionally to the amount of available information: As a consequence, we argue that our method can be useful in computer security as a complementary or alternative way to user authentication and as an aid to intrusion detection.
