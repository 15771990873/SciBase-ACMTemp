In this paper, we discuss the use of combinatorial set systems (combinatorial designs) in the design of key predistribution schemes (KPSs) for sensor networks. We show that the performance of a KPS can be improved by carefully choosing a certain class of set systems as “key ring spaces”. Especially, we analyze KPSs based on a type of combinatorial design known as a <it>transversal design</it>. We employ two types of transversal designs, which are represented by the set of all linear polynomials and the set of quadratic polynomials (over some finite field), respectively. These KPSs turn out to have significant efficiency in a shared-key discovery phase without degrading connectivity and resiliency.
