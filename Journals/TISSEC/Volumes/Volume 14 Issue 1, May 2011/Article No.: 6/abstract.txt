We present a new technique that can trace data provenance and enforce data access policies across multiple applications and machines. We have developed Garm, a tool that uses binary rewriting to implement this technique on arbitrary binaries. Users can use Garm to attach access policies to data and Garm enforces the policy on all accesses to the data (and any derived data) across all applications and executions. Garm uses static analysis to generate optimized instrumentation that traces the provenance of an application's state and the policies that apply to this state. Garm monitors the interactions of the application with the underlying operating system to enforce policies. Conceptually, Garm combines trusted computing support from the underlying operating system with a stream cipher to ensure that data protected by an access policy cannot be accessed outside of Garm's policy enforcement mechanisms. We have evaluated Garm with several common Linux applications. We found that Garm can successfully trace the provenance of data across executions of multiple applications and enforce data access policies on the application's executions.
