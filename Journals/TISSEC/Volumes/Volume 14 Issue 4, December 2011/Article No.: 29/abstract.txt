Several anonymous authentication schemes allow servers to revoke a misbehaving user's ability to make future accesses. Traditionally, these schemes have relied on powerful Trusted Third Parties (TTPs) capable of deanonymizing (or linking) users' connections. Such TTPs are undesirable because users' anonymity is not guaranteed, and users must trust them to judge misbehaviors fairly. Recent schemes such asBlacklistable Anonymous Credentials (BLAC)andEnhanced Privacy ID (EPID)support “privacy-enhanced revocation”— servers can revoke misbehaving users without a TTP's involvement, and without learning the revoked users' identities.In BLAC and EPID, however, the computation required for authentication at the server islinear in the size (L) of the revocation list, which is impractical as the size approaches thousands of entries. We propose PEREA, a new anonymous authentication scheme for which this bottleneck computation isindependent of the size of the revocation list. Instead, the time complexity of authentication is linear in the size of arevocation windowK&Lt;L, the number of subsequent authentications before which a user's misbehavior must be recognized if the user is to be revoked. We extend PEREA to support more complex revocation policies that take theseverityof misbehaviors into account. Users can authenticate anonymously if theirnaughtiness, i.e., the sum of the severities of their blacklisted misbehaviors, is below a certain naughtiness threshold. We call our extension PEREA-Naughtiness. We prove the security of our constructions, and validate their efficiency as compared to BLAC analytically and quantitatively.
