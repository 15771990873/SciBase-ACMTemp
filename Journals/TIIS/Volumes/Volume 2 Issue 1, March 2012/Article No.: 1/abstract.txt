Affect-sensitive systems such as social robots and virtual agents are increasingly being investigated in real-world settings. In order to work effectively in natural environments, these systems require the ability to infer the affective and mental states of humans and to provide appropriate timely output that helps to sustain long-term interactions. This special issue, which appears in two parts, includes articles on the design of socio-emotional behaviors and expressions in robots and virtual agents and on computational approaches for the automatic recognition of social signals and affective states.
