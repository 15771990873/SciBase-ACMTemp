Personalized technologies aim to enhance user experience by taking into account usersâ€™ interests, preferences, and other relevant information. Persuasive technologies aim to modify user attitudes, intentions, or behavior through computer-human dialogue and social influence. While both personalized and persuasive technologies influence user interaction and behavior, we posit that this influence could be significantly increased if the two technologies were combined to createpersonalized and persuasivesystems. For example, the persuasive power of a one-size-fits-all persuasive intervention could be enhanced by considering the users being influenced and their susceptibility to the persuasion being offered. Likewise, personalized technologies could cash in on increased success, in terms of user satisfaction, revenue, and user experience, if their services used persuasive techniques. Hence, the coupling of personalization and persuasion has the potential to enhance the impact of both technologies. This new, developing area clearly offers mutual benefits to both research areas, as we illustrate in this special issue.
