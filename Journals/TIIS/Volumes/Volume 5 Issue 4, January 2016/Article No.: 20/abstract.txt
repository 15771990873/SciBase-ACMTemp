Several emerging approaches to activity recognition (AR) combine symbolic representation of user actions with probabilistic elements for reasoning under uncertainty. These approaches provide promising results in terms of recognition performance, coping with the uncertainty of observations, and model size explosion when complex problems are modelled. But experience has shown that it is not always intuitive to model even seemingly simple problems. To date, there are no guidelines for developing such models. To address this problem, in this work we present a development process for building symbolic models that is based on experience acquired so far as well as on existing engineering and data analysis workflows. The proposed process is a first attempt at providing structured guidelines and practices for designing, modelling, and evaluating human behaviour in the form of symbolic models for AR. As an illustration of the process, a simple example from the office domain was developed. The process was evaluated in a comparative study of an intuitive process and the proposed process. The results showed a significant improvement over the intuitive process. Furthermore, the study participants reported greater ease of use and perceived effectiveness when following the proposed process. To evaluate the applicability of the process to more complex AR problems, it was applied to a problem from the kitchen domain. The results showed that following the proposed process yielded an average accuracy of 78&percnt;. The developed model outperformed state-of-the-art methods applied to the same dataset in previous work, and it performed comparably to a symbolic model developed by a model expert without following the proposed development process.
