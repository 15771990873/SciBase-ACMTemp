Gaze is an important nonverbal feedback signal in multiparty face-to-face conversations. It is well known that gaze behaviors differ depending on participation role: speaker, addressee, or side participant. In this study, we focus on dominance as another factor that affects gaze. First, we conducted an empirical study and analyzed its results that showed how gaze behaviors are affected by both dominance and participation roles. Then, using speech and gaze information that was statistically significant for distinguishing the more dominant and less dominant person in an empirical study, we established a regression-based model for estimating conversational dominance. On the basis of the model, we implemented a dominance estimation mechanism that processes online speech and head direction data. Then we applied our findings to human-robot interaction. To design robot gaze behaviors, we analyzed gaze transitions with respect to participation roles and dominance and implemented gaze-transition models as robot gaze behavior generation rules. Finally, we evaluated a humanoid robot that has dominance estimation functionality and determines its gaze based on the gaze models, and we found that dominant participants had a better impression of less dominant robot gaze behaviors. This suggests that a robot using our gaze models was preferred to a robot that was simply looking at the speaker. We have demonstrated the importance of considering dominance in human-robot multiparty interaction.
