Smart environments are now designed as natural interfaces to capture and understand human behavior without a need for explicit human-computer interaction. In this article, we present a general-purpose architecture that acquires and understands human behaviors through a sensing floor. The pressure field generated by moving people is captured and analyzed. Specific actions and events are then detected by a low-level processing engine and sent to high-level interfaces providing different functions. The proposed architecture and sensors are modular, general-purpose, cheap, and suitable for both small- and large-area coverage. Some sample entertainment and virtual reality applications that we developed to test the platform are presented.
