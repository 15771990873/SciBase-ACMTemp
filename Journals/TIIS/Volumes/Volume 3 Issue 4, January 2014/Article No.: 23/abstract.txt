We present a series of projects for end-user authoring of interactive robotic behaviors, with a particular focus on thestyleof those behaviors: we call this approach Style-by-Demonstration (SBD). We provide an overview introduction of three different SBD platforms: SBD for animated character interactive locomotion paths, SBD for interactive robot locomotion paths, and SBD for interactive robot dance. The primary contribution of this article is a detailed cross-project SBD analysis of the interaction designs and evaluation approaches employed, with the goal of providing general guidelines stemming from our experiences, for both developing and evaluating SBD systems. In addition, we provide the first full account of our Puppet Master SBD algorithm, with an explanation of how it evolved through the projects.
