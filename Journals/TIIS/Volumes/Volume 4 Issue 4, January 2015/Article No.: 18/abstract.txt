This article presents a gesture recognition/adaptation system for human--computer interaction applications that goes beyond activity classification and that, as a complement to gesture labeling, characterizes the movement execution. We describe a template-based recognition method that simultaneously aligns the input gesture to the templates using a Sequential Monte Carlo inference technique. Contrary to standard template-based methods based on dynamic programming, such as Dynamic Time Warping, the algorithm has an adaptation process that tracks gesture variation in real time. The method continuously updates, during execution of the gesture, the estimated parameters and recognition results, which offers key advantages for continuous human--machine interaction. The technique is evaluated in several different ways: Recognition and early recognition are evaluated on 2D onscreen pen gestures; adaptation is assessed on synthetic data; and both early recognition and adaptation are evaluated in a user study involving 3D free-space gestures. The method is robust to noise, and successfully adapts to parameter variation. Moreover, it performs recognition as well as or better than nonadapting offline template-based methods.
