We are witnessing a paradigm shift in Human Language Technology (HLT) that may well have an impact on the field comparable to the statistical revolution: acquiring large-scale resources by exploiting collective intelligence. An illustration of this new approach isPhrase Detectives, an interactive onlinegame with a purposefor creating anaphorically annotated resources that makes use of a highly distributed population of contributors with different levels of expertise.The purpose of this article is to first of all give an overview of all aspects of Phrase Detectives, from the design of the game and the HLT methods we used to the results we have obtained so far. It furthermore summarizes the lessons that we have learned in developing this game which should help other researchers to design and implement similar games.
