Two studies examined the different features of humanoid robots and the influence on children's affective behavior. The first study looked at interaction styles and general features of robots. The second study looked at how the robot's attention influences children's behavior and engagement. Through activities familiar to young children (e.g., table setting, story telling), the first study found that cooperative interaction style elicited more oculesic behavior and social engagement. The second study found that quality of attention, type of attention, and length of interaction influences affective behavior and engagement. In the quality of attention, Wizard-of-Oz (woz) elicited the most affective behavior, but automatic attention worked as well as woz when the interaction was short. The type of attention going from nonverbal to verbal attention increased children's oculesic behavior, utterance, and physiological response. Affective interactions did not seem to depend on a single mechanism, but a well-chosen confluence of technical features.
