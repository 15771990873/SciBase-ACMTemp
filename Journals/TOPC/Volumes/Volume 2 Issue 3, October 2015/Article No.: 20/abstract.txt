We study a distributed randomized information propagation mechanism in networks we call thecoalescing-branchingrandom walk (cobra walk, for short). A cobra walk is a generalization of the well-studied “standard” random walk, and is useful in modeling and understanding the Susceptible-Infected- Susceptible (SIS)-type of epidemic processes in networks. It can also be helpful in performing light-weight information dissemination in resource-constrained networks. A cobra walk is parameterized by abranching factork. The process starts from an arbitrary vertex, which is labeledactivefor step 1. In each step of a cobra walk, each active vertex chooseskrandom neighbors to become active for the next step (“branching”). A vertex is active for stept+ 1 only if it is chosen by an active vertex in stept(“coalescing”). This results in a stochastic process in the underlying network with properties that are quite different from both the standard random walk (which is equivalent to the cobra walk with branching factor 1) as well as other gossip-based rumor spreading mechanisms.We focus on thecover timeof the cobra walk, which is the number of steps for the walk to reach all the vertices, and derive almost-tight bounds for various graph classes. We show anO(log2n) high probability bound for the cover time of cobra walks on expanders, if either the expansion factor or the branching factor is sufficiently large; we also obtain anO(logn) high probability bound for thepartial cover time, which is the number of steps needed for the walk to reach at least a constant fraction of the vertices. We also show that the cover time of the cobra walk is, with high probability,O(nlogn) on anyn-vertex tree fork≥ 2,Õ(n1/d) on ad-dimensional grid fork≥ 2, andO(logn) on the complete graph.
