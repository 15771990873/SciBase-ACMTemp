Advanced 3D mobile devices attract a lot of attentions for 3D visualization nowadays. Stereoscopic images and video taken from the 3D mobile devices are uncomfortable for 3D viewing experiences due to the limited hardware for stereoscopic 3D stabilization. The existing stereoscopic 3D stabilization methods are computationally inefficient for the 3D mobile devices. In this article, we point out that this critical issue deteriorates the 3D viewing experiences on the 3D mobile devices. To improve visual comfort, we propose an efficient and effective algorithm to stabilize the stereoscopic images and video for the 3D mobile devices. To rectify the video jitter, we use the gyroscope and accelerometer embedded on the mobile devices to obtain the geometry information of the cameras. Using a different method than video-content-based motion estimation, our algorithm based on the gyroscope and acceleration data can achieve higher accuracy to effectively stabilize the video. Therefore, our approach is robust in video stabilization even under poor lighting and substantial foreground motion. Our algorithm outperforms previous approaches in not only smaller running time but also the better comfort of the stereoscopic 3D visualization for the 3D mobile devices.
