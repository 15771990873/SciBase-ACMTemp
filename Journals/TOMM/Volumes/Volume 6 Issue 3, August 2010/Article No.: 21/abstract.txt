Traffic modeling and simulation plays an important role in the area of Network Monitoring and Analysis, for it provides practitioners with efficient tools to evaluate the performance of networks and of their elements. This article focus on the traffic generated by a single source, providing an overview of what was done in the field and studying the statistical properties of the traffic produced by a personal computer, including analysis of the autocorrelation structure. Different distributions were fitted to the interarrival times, packet sizes, and byte count processes with the goal of singling out the ones most suitable for traffic generation.
