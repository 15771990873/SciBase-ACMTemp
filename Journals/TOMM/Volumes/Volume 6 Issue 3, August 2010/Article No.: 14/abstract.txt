We investigate the challenging issue of joint audio-visual analysis of generic videos targeting at concept detection. We extract a novel local representation, Audio-Visual Atom (AVA), which is defined as a region track associated with regional visual features and audio onset features. We develop a hierarchical algorithm to extract visual atoms from generic videos, and locate energy onsets from the corresponding soundtrack by time-frequency analysis. Audio atoms are extracted around energy onsets. Visual and audio atoms form AVAs, based on which discriminative audio-visual codebooks are constructed for concept detection. Experiments over Kodak's consumer benchmark videos confirm the effectiveness of our approach.
