We discuss the design goals for an integrated media creation environment (IMCE) aimed at enabling the average user to create media artifacts with professional qualities. The resulting requirements are implemented and we demonstrate the efficacy of the resulting system with the generation of two simple home movies. The significance for the average user seeking to create home movies lies in the flexible and automatic application of film principles to the task, removal of tedious low-level editing by means of well-formed media transformations in terms of high-level film constructs (e.g., tempo), and content repurposing powered by those same transformations added to the rich semantic information maintained at each phase of the process.
