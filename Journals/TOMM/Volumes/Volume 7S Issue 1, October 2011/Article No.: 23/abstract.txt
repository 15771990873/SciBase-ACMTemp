Future multimedia applications will rely on the transmission of 3D video contents within heterogeneous fruition scenarios, and as a matter of fact, the reliable delivery of 3D video signals proves to be a crucial issue in such communications. To this purpose, multimedia communication experts have been designing cross-layer strategies to improve the quality of the perceived 3D experience. This article presents a new cross-layer strategy, called Cognitive Source Coding (CSC), that defines a new 3D video system able to identify the different elements of the 3D scene and choose the most appropriate coding strategy.
