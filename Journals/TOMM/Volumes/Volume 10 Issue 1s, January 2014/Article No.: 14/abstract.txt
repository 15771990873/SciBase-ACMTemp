The importance of winning has increased the role of performance analysis in the sports industry, and this underscores how statistics and technology keep changing the way sports are played. Thus, this is a growing area of interest, both from a computer system view in managing the technical challenges and from a sport performance view in aiding the development of athletes. In this respect, Bagadus is a real-time prototype of a sports analytics application using soccer as a case study. Bagadus integrates a sensor system, a soccer analytics annotations system, and a video processing system using a video camera array. A prototype is currently installed at Alfheim Stadium in Norway, and in this article, we describe how the system can be used in real-time to playback events. The system supports both stitched panorama video and camera switching modes and creates video summaries based on queries to the sensor system. Moreover, we evaluate the system from a systems point of view, benchmarking different approaches, algorithms, and trade-offs, and show how the system runs in real time.
