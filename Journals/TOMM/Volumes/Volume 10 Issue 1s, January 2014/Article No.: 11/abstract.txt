As a step towards enhancing users' perceived multimedia quality levels, this article presents the results of a study which looked at user's perception of inter-stream synchronization between scent and video. The ability to detect and the perception of and impact of skew on user's quality of experience is analyzed considering user's age, sex, and culture (user profile). The results indicate that skews beyond a certain level between olfaction and video have a negative impact on user-perceived experience. Olfaction before video is more noticeable to users than olfaction after video, and assessors are more tolerable of olfactory data presented after video.
