As a commonly used unsupervised learning algorithm inContent-Based Image Retrieval(CBIR),Expectation-Maximization(EM) algorithm has several limitations, including the curse of dimensionality and the convergence at a local maximum. In this article, we propose a novel learning approach, namelyCoevolutionary Feature Synthesized Expectation-Maximization(CFS-EM), to address the above problems. The CFS-EM is a hybrid ofcoevolutionary genetic programming(CGP) and EM algorithm applied on partially labeled data. CFS-EM is especially suitable for image retrieval because the images can be searched in the synthesized low-dimensional feature space, while a kernel-based method has to make classification computation in the original high-dimensional space. Experiments on real image databases show that CFS-EM outperformsRadial Basis Function Support Vector Machine(RBF-SVM), CGP,Discriminant-EM(D-EM) andTransductive-SVM(TSVM) in the sense of classification performance and it is computationally more efficient than RBF-SVM in the query phase.
