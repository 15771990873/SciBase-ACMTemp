In content-based visual object retrieval, image representation is one of the fundamental issues in improving retrieval performance. Existing works adopt either local SIFT-like features or holistic features, and may suffer sensitivity to noise or poor discrimination power. In this article, we propose a compact representation for scalable object retrieval from few generic object regions. The regions are identified with a general object detector and are described with a fusion of learning-based features and aggregated SIFT features. Further, we compress feature representation in large-scale image retrieval scenarios. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on two public ground-truth datasets, with promising results. Experimental results on a million-scale image database demonstrate superior retrieval accuracy with efficiency gain in both computation and memory usage.
