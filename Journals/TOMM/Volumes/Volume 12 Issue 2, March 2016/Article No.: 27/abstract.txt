Three-dimensional (3D) sensing and printing technologies have reshaped our world in recent years. In this article, a comprehensive overview of techniques related to the pipeline from 3D sensing to printing is provided. We compare the latest 3D sensors and 3D printers and introduce several sensing, postprocessing, and printing techniques available from both commercial deployments and published research. In addition, we demonstrate several devices, software, and experimental results of our related projects to further elaborate details of this process. A case study is conducted to further illustrate the possible tradeoffs during the process of this pipeline. Current progress, future research trends, and potential risks of 3D technologies are also discussed.
