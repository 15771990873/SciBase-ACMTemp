The design and implementation of a client-centered multimedia content adaptation system suitable for a mobile environment comprising of resource-constrained handheld devices or clients is described. The primary contributions of this work are: (1) the overall architecture of the client-centered content adaptation system, (2) a data-driven multi-level Hidden Markov model (HMM)-based approach to perform both video segmentation and video indexing in a single pass, and (3) the formulation and implementation of a Multiple-choice Multidimensional Knapsack Problem (MMKP)-based video personalization strategy. In order to segment and index video data, a video stream is modeled at both the semantic unit level and video program level. These models are learned entirely from training data and no domain-dependent knowledge about the structure of video programs is used. This makes the system capable of handling various kinds of videos without having to manually redefine the program model. The proposed MMKP-based personalization strategy is shown to include more relevant video content in response to the client's request than the existing 0/1 knapsack problem and fractional knapsack problem-based strategies, and is capable of satisfying multiple client-side constraints simultaneously. Experimental results on CNN news videos and Major League Soccer (MLS) videos are presented and analyzed.
