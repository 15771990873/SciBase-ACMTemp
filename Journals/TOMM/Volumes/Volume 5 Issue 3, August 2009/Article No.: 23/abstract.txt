This article addresses the problem of how to select the optimal combination of sensors and how to determine their optimal placement in a surveillance region in order to meet the given performance requirements at a minimal cost for a multimedia surveillance system. We propose to solve this problem by obtaining a performance vector, with its elements representing the performances of subtasks, for a given input combination of sensors and their placement. Then we show that the optimal sensor selection problem can be converted into the form of Integer Linear Programming problem (ILP) by using a linear model for computing the optimal performance vector corresponding to a sensor combination. Optimal performance vector corresponding to a sensor combination refers to the performance vector corresponding to the optimal placement of a sensor combination. To demonstrate the utility of our technique, we design and build a surveillance system consisting of PTZ (Pan-Tilt-Zoom) cameras and active motion sensors for capturing faces. Finally, we show experimentally that optimal placement of sensors based on the design maximizes the system performance.
