This study looked at users' perception of interstream synchronization between audiovisual media and two olfactory streams. The ability to detect skews and the perception and impact of skews on user Quality of Experience (QoE) is analyzed. The olfactory streams are presented with the same skews (i.e., delay) and with variable skews (i.e., jitter and mix of scents). This article reports the limits beyond which desynchronization reduces user-perceived quality levels. Also, a minimum gap between the presentations of consecutive scents is identified, necessary to ensuring enhanced user-perceived quality. There is no evidence (not considering scent type) that overlapping or mixing of scents increases user QoE levels for olfaction-enhanced multimedia.
