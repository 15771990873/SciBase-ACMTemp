Current QoE research is mainly focusing on single modalities (audio, visual) or combinations thereof. In our research, we propose annotating traditional multimedia content with additional sensory effects, such as ambient light, vibration, wind, and olfaction, which could potentially stimulate all human senses. Investigating the influence of individual sensory effects and combinations thereof is important in order to understand how these individual sensory effects influence the Quality of Experience (QoE) as a whole. In this article, we describe the results of such a subjective quality assessment of audio-visual sequences which are annotated with additional sensory effects such as ambient light, wind, and vibration using the MPEG-V standard. The results of this assessment allow us to derive a utility model representing the Quality of Sensory Experience (QuaSE) complementary to existing QoE models described in terms of Quality of Service (QoS) parameters. For validating our proposed utility model, we provide an example instantiation and validate it against results of subjective quality assessments.
