Animations are a part of multimedia and techniques such as motion mapping and inverse kinematics aid in reusing models and motion sequences to create new animations. This reuse approach is facilitated by the use of content-based retrieval techniques that often require fuzzy query resolution. Most fuzzy query resolution approaches work on all the attributes of the query to minimize the database access cost thus resulting in an unsatisfactory result set. It turns out that the query resolution can be carried out in a partial manner to achieve user satisfactory results and aid in easy authoring. In this article, we present two partial fuzzy query resolution approaches, one that results in high-quality animations and the other that produces results with decreasing number of satisfied conditions in the query.
