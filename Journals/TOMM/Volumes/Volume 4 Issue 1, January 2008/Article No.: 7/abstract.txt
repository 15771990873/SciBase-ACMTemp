At one end of the spectrum, research in interactive content-based retrieval concentrates on machine learning methods for effective use of relevance feedback. On the other end, the information visualization community focuses on effective methods for conveying information to the user. What is lacking is research considering the information visualization and interactive retrieval as truly integrated parts of one content-based search system. In such an integrated system, there are many degrees of freedom like the similarity function, the number of images to display, the image size, different visualization modes, and possible feedback modes. To base the optimal values for all of those on user studies is unfeasible. We therefore develop search scenarios in which tasks and user actions are simulated. From there, the proposed scheme is optimized based on objective constraints and evaluation criteria. In such a manner, the degrees of freedom are reduced and the remaining degrees can be evaluated in user studies. In this article, we present a system that integrates advanced similarity based visualization with active learning. We have performed extensive experimentation on interactive category search with different image collections. The results using the proposed simulation scheme show that indeed the use of advanced visualization and active learning pays off in all of these datasets.
