This article proposes three methods to estimate the distortion deriving from packet losses in wireless video communication. The proposed methods take into account the short-term properties of the encoded video sequences. A suitable set of functions is adopted to model the distortion envelope resulting from multiple losses. The estimated performance is compared with the actual distortion, evaluated by decoding the received sequence with a properly designed decoder. Numerical results confirm the accuracy of the proposed models in approximating the actual Mean Square Error (MSE) for a wide range of loss rates. Some applications of the proposed algorithms are presented.
