Various Information Management techniques have been developed to help maintain a consistent shared virtual world in a Networked Virtual Environment. However, such techniques have to be carefully adapted to the application state dynamics and the underlying network. This work presents a novel framework that minimizes inconsistency by optimizing bandwidth usage to deliver useful information. This framework measures the state evolution using an information model and dynamically switches extrapolation models and the packet rate to make the most information-efficient usage of the available bandwidth. The results shown demonstrate that this approach can help optimize consistency under constrained and time-varying network conditions.
