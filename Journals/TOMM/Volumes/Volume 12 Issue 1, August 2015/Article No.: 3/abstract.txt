Photos are an important information carrier for implicit relationships. In this article, we introduce an image based social network, calledCelebrityNet, built from implicit relationships encoded in a collection of celebrity images. We analyze the social properties reflected in this image-based social network and automatically infer communities among the celebrities. We demonstrate the interesting discoveries of the CelebrityNet. We particularly compare the inferred communities with human manually labeled ones and show quantitatively that the automatically detected communities are highly aligned with that of human interpretation. Inspired by the uniqueness of visual content and tag concepts within each community of the CelebrityNet, we further demonstrate that the constructed social network can serve as a knowledge base for high-level visual recognition tasks. In particular, this social network is capable of significantly improving the performance of automatic image annotation and classification of unknown images.
