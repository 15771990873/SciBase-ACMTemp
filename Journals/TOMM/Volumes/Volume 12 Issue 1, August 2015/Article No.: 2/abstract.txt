We study the problem of resource-efficient uplink distribution of user-generated video content over fourth-generation mobile networks. This is challenged by (1) the capacity-limited and time-variant uplink channel, (2) the resource-hungry upstreamed videos and their dynamically changing complexity, and (3) the different playout times of the video consumers. To address these issues, we propose a systematic approach for quality-of-experience (QoE)-based resource optimization and uplink transmission of multiuser generated video content. More specifically, we present an analytical model for distributed scalable video transmission at the mobile producers which considers these constraints. This is complemented by a multiuser cross-layer optimizer in the mobile network which determines the transmission capacity for each mobile terminal under current cell load and radio conditions. Both optimal and low-complexity solutions are presented. Simulation results for LTE uplink transmission show that significant gains in perceived video quality can be achieved by our cross-layer resource optimization scheme. In addition, the distributed optimization at the mobile producers can further improve the user experience across the different types of video consumers.
