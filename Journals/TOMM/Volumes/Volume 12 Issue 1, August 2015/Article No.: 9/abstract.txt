Even though people of all social standings use current mobile devices in the wide spectrum of purpose from entertainment tools to communication means, some issues with real-time video streaming in hostile wireless environment still exist. In this article, we introduceCoSA, a link-aware real-time video streaming system for mobile devices. The proposed system utilizes a 3D camera to distinguish the region of importance (ROI) and non-ROI region within the video frame. Based on the link-state feedback from the receiver, the proposed system allocates a higher bandwidth for the region that is classified as ROI and a lower bandwidth for non-ROI in the video stream by reducing the video's bit rate. We implementedCoSAin a real test-bed where the IEEE 802.11 is employed as a medium for wireless networking. Furthermore, we verified the effectiveness of the proposed system by conducting a thorough empirical study. The results indicate that the proposed system enables real-time video streaming while maintaining a consistent visual quality by dynamically reconfiguring video coding parameters according to the link quality.
