We propose a steganalytic algorithm for triangle meshes, based on the supervised training of a classifier by discriminative feature vectors. After a normalization step, the triangle mesh is calibrated by one step of Laplacian smoothing and then a feature vector is computed, encoding geometric information corresponding to vertices, edges and faces. For a given steganographic or watermarking algorithm, we create a training set containing unmarked meshes and meshes marked by that algorithm, and train a classifier using Quadratic Discriminant Analysis. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated on six well-known watermarking/steganographic schemes with satisfactory accuracy rates.
