Desktop operating systems such as Windows and Linux base scheduling decisions on CPU consumption; processes that consume fewer CPU cycles are prioritized, assuming that interactive processes gain from this since they spend most of their time waiting for user input. However, this doesn't work for modern multimedia applications which require significant CPU resources. We therefore suggest a new metric to identify interactive processes by explicitly measuring interactions with the user, and we use it to design and implement a process scheduler. Measurements using a variety of applications indicate that this scheduler is very effective in distinguishing between competing interactive and noninteractive processes.
