This article presents a graphics software architecture for next-generation digital television receivers. We propose that such receivers should include a standardised Java-based procedural environment capable of rendering 2D/3D graphics and video, and a declarative environment supporting W3C recommendations such as SMIL and XForms. We also introduce a graphics architecture model that meets such requirements. As a proof-of-concept, a prototype implementation of the model is presented. This implementation enhances television content by allowing the user to play 3D graphics games, to run Java applications, and to browse XML-based documents while meeting current hardware restrictions.
