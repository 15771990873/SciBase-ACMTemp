We present in this article a temporal SMIL editor with incremental verification capabilities, based on a formal Petri Net--based model. Our authoring tool, named SMIL Builder, allows the author to “build” his document step by step, while insuring at every stage the validity of the current state of the document. These incremental authoring and consistency checking features are based on the H-SMIL-Net model (Hierarchical SMIL Petri Net), a temporal extension of Petri Nets. Our aim is to propose an easy-to-use temporal environment which can satisfy a wide range of users; so we opted for an interface combining simplicity and ergonomics.
