This article investigates a scenario of reuse in which existing learning resources serve as preliminary products for the creation of new learning resources. Authors should be able to reuse learning resources and also parts of them at different levels of granularity in a modular way. The requirements of multigranularity reuse are analyzed and compared to existing solutions. A concept for modular, multigranularity reuse is presented in this article. It is also shown how this kind of reuse can be achieved in practise.
