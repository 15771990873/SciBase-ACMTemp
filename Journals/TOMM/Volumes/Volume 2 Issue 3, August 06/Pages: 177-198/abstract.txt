In this article, we describe the MX-Onto ontology for providing a Semantic Web compatible representation of music resources based on their context. The context representation is realized by means of an OWL ontology that describes music information and that defines rules and classes for a flexible genre classification. By flexible classification we mean that the proposed approach enables capturing the subjective interpretation of music genres by defining multiple membership relations between a music resource and the corresponding music genres, thus supporting context-based and proximity-based search of music resources.
