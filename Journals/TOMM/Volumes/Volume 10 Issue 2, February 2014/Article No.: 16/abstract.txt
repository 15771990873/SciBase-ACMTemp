Distributed virtual environments (DVEs) are attracting a lot of attention in recent years, due to the increasing popularity of online gaming and social networks. As the number of concurrent users of a DVE increases, a critical problem is on how the workload among multiple servers can be balanced in order to maintain real-time performance. Although a number of load balancing methods have been proposed, they either try to produce high quality load balancing results and become too slow or emphasize on efficiency and the load balancing results become less effective. In this article, we propose a new approach to address this problem based on heat diffusion. Our work has two main contributions. First, we propose a local and a global load balancing methods for DVEs based on heat diffusion. Second, we investigate two performance factors of the proposed methods, the convergence threshold and the load balancing interval. We have conducted a number of experiments to extensively evaluate the performance of the proposed methods. Our experimental results show that the proposed methods outperform existing methods in that our methods are effective in reducing server overloading while at the same time being efficient.
