A novel content-adaptive music watermarking technique is proposed in this article. To optimally balance inaudibility and robustness when embedding and extracting watermarks, the embedding scheme is highly related to the music structure and human auditory system (HAS). A note-based segmentation method is proposed and used for music vocal/instrumental boundary detection. A multiple bit hopping and hiding scheme with different embedding parameters is applied to vocal and instrumental frames of the music. The experimental results in inaudibility and robustness are provided to support all novel features in the proposed watermarking scheme.
