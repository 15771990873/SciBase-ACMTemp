We propose a novel transcoding technique calledmultimedia simplificationwhich is based on experiential sampling. Multimedia simplification helps optimize the synthesis of MMS (multimedia messaging service) messages for mobile phones. Transcoding is useful in overcoming the limitations of these compact devices. The proposed approach aims at reducing the redundancy in the multimedia data captured by multiple types of media sensors. The simplified data is first stored into a gallery for further usage. Once a request for MMS is received, the MMS server makes use of the simplified media from the gallery. The multimedia data is aligned with respect to the timeline for MMS message synthesis. We demonstrate the use of the proposed techniques for two applications, namely, soccer video and home care monitoring video. The MMS sent to the receiver can basically reflect the gist of important events of interest to the user. Our technique is targeted towards users who are interested in obtaining salient multimedia information via mobile devices.
