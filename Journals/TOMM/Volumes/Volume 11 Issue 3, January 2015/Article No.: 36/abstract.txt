Verifiability is essential for the secret sharing approach, which allows the involved participants to detect cheaters during the secret retrieval process. In this article, we propose a double verification secret sharing (DVSS) mechanism that can not only prevent fraudulent participants but also satisfy the requirements of secret payload, camouflage, image fidelity and lossless revealed secret. DVSS offers double verification process to enhance the cheater detectability; experimental results reveal that the designed scheme can share larger secret capacity and retain superior image quality than the related secret sharing methods.
