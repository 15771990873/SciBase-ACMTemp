This article proposes a framework for creating user-preference-aware music medleys from users' music collections. We treat the medley generation process as an audio version of a musical dice game. Once the user's collection has been analyzed, the system is able to generate various pleasing medleys. This flexibility allows users to create medleys according to the specified conditions, such as the medley structure or the must-use clips. Even users without musical knowledge can compose medley songs from their favorite tracks. The effectiveness of the system has been evaluated through both objective and subjective experiments on individual components in the system.
