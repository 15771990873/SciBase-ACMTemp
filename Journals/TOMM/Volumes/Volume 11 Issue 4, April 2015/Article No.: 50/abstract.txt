Wireless communication systems are highly prone to channel errors. With video being a major player in Internet traffic and undergoing exponential growth in wireless domain, we argue for the need of a Video-aware MAC (VMAC) to significantly improve the throughput and delay performance of real-time video streaming service. VMAC makes two changes to optimize wireless LAN for video traffic: (a) It incorporates a Perceptual-Error-Tolerance (PET) to the MAC frames by reducing MAC retransmissions while minimizing any impact on perceptual video quality; and (b) It uses a group NACK-based Adaptive Window (NAW) of MAC frames to improve both throughput and delay performance in varying channel conditions. Through simulations and experiments, we observe 56--89&percnt; improvement in throughput and 34--48&percnt; improvement in delay performance over legacy DCF and 802.11e schemes. VMAC also shows 15--78&percnt; improvement over legacy schemes with multiple clients.
