Haze removal is the process by which horizontal obscuration is eliminated from hazy images captured during inclement weather. Images captured in natural environments with varied weather conditions frequently exhibit localized light sources or color-shift effects. The occurrence of these effects presents a difficult challenge for hazy image restoration, with which many traditional restoration methods cannot adequately contend. In this article, we present a new image haze removal approach based on Fisher's linear discriminant-based dual dark channel prior scheme in order to solve the problems associated with the presence of localized light sources and color shifts, and thereby achieve effective restoration. Experimental restoration results via qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that our proposed approach can provide higher haze-removal efficacy for images captured in varied weather conditions than can the other state-of-the-art approaches.
