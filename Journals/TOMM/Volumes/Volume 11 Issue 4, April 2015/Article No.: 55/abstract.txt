Video dissemination over Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks is an attractive technology that supports many novel applications. The merit of this work lies in the design of an efficient video dissemination protocol that provides high video quality at different data rates for urban scenarios. Our objective is to improve received video quality while meeting delay and packet loss. In this work, we first employ a reliable scheme known as connected dominating set, which is an efficient receiver-based routing scheme for broadcasting video content. To avoid repeated computing of the connected dominating set, we add three statuses to each node. In nonscalable video coding, the distribution of lost frames can cause a major impact on video quality at the receiver's end. Therefore, for the second step, we employ Interleaving to spread out the burst losses and to reduce the influence of loss distributions. Although Interleaving can reduce the influence of cluster frame loss, single packet loss is also a concern due to collisions, and to intermittent disconnection in the topology. In order to fix these single packet losses, we propose a store-carry-forward scheme for the nodes in order to retransmit the local buffer stored packets. The results, when compared to the selected base protocols, show that our proposed protocol is an efficient solution for video dissemination over urban Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks.
