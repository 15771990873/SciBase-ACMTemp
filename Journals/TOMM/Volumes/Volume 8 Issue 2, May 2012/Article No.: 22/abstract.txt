There has been related research for sprite or mosaic generation for over 15 years. In this article, we try to understand the methodologies for sprite generation and identify what has not actually been covered for sprite generation. We first identify issues and focus on the domain of videos for sprite generation. We introduce a novel sprite fusion method that blends two sprites. Sprite fusion method produces good results for tracking videos and does not require object segmentation. We present sample results of our experiments.
