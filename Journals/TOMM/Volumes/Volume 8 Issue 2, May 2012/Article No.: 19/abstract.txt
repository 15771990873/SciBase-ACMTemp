A new interactive television experience has been created for watching television news. The goal is to create a news experience that is similar to the way people watch television in their living rooms while giving viewers the power to make choices about what they see. We partnered with existing news organizations to create tools consistent with current news production practices. The viewer experience allows selection of the order of news content, skipping unwanted content and exploring stories in more depth. These tools were used to produce seven days of interactive commercial news that were viewed in ten homes.
