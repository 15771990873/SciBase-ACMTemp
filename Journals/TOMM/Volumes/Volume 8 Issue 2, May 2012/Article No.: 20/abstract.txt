Online First Person Shooter (FPS) games typically use a client-server communication model, with thousands of enthusiast-hosted game servers active at any time. Traditional FPS server discovery may take minutes, as clients create thousands of short-lived packet flows while probing all available servers to find a selection of game servers with tolerable round trip time (RTT). REED reduces a client's probing time and network traffic to 1&percnt; of traditional server discovery. REED game servers participate in a centralized, incremental calculation of their network coordinates, and clients use these coordinates to expedite the discovery of servers with low RTTs.
