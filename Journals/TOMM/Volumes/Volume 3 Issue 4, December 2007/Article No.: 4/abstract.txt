This article discusses a framework for model-based, context-dependent video coding based on exploitation of characteristics of the human visual system. The system utilizes variable-quality coding based on priority maps which are created using mostly context-dependent rules. The technique is demonstrated through two case studies of specific video context, namely open signed content and football sequences. Eye-tracking analysis is employed for identifying the characteristics of each context, which are subsequently exploited for coding purposes, either directly or through a gaze prediction model. The framework is shown to achieve a considerable improvement in coding efficiency.
