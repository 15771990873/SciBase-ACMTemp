Advancements in graphics hardware have allowed development of hardware-accelerated imaging displays. This article reviews techniques for real-time simulation of arbitrary visual fields over still images and video. The goal is to provide the vision sciences and perceptual graphics communities techniques for the investigation of fundamental processes of visual perception. Classic gaze-contingent displays used for these purposes are reviewed and for the first time a pixel shader is introduced for display of a high-resolution window over peripherally degraded stimulus. The pixel shader advances current state-of-the-art by allowing real-time processing of still or streamed images, obviating the need for preprocessing or storage.
