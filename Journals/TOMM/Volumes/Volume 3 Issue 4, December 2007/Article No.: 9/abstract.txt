Computers have increasingly become part of our everyday lives, with many activities either involving their direct use or being supported by one. This has prompted research into developing methods and mechanisms to assist humans in interacting with computers (human-computer interaction, or HCI). A number of HCI techniques have been developed over the years, some of which are quite old but continue to be used, and some more recent and still evolving. Many of these interaction techniques, however, are not natural in their use and typically require the user to learn a new means of interaction. Inconsistencies within these techniques and the restrictions they impose on user creativity can also make such interaction techniques difficult to use, especially for novice users.This article proposes an alternative interaction method, the conductor interaction method (CIM), which aims to provide a more natural and easier-to-learn interaction technique. This novel interaction method extends existing HCI methods by drawing upon techniques found in human-human interaction. It is argued that the use of a two-phased multimodal interaction mechanism, using gaze for selection and gesture for manipulation, incorporated within a metaphor-based environment, can provide a viable alternative for interacting with a computer (especially for novice users). Both the model and an implementation of the CIM within a system are presented in this article. This system formed the basis of a number of user studies that have been performed to assess the effectiveness of the CIM, the findings of which are discussed in this work.
