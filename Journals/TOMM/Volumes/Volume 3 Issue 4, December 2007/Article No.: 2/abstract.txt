A single-camera iris-tracking and remapping approach based on passive computer vision is presented. Tracking is aimed at obtaining accurate and robust measurements of the iris/pupil position. To this purpose, a robust method for ellipse fitting is used, employing search constraints so as to achieve better performance with respect to the standard RANSAC algorithm. Tracking also embeds an iris localization algorithm (working as a bootstrap multiple-hypotheses generation step), and a blink detector that can detect voluntary eye blinks in human-computer interaction applications. On-screen remapping incorporates a head-tracking method capable of compensating for small user-head movements. The approach operates in real time under different light conditions and in the presence of distractors. An extensive set of experiments is presented and discussed. In particular, an evaluation method for the choice of layout of both hardware components and calibration points is described. Experiments also investigate the importance of providing a visual feedback to the user, and the benefits gained from performing head compensation, especially during image-to-screen map calibration.
