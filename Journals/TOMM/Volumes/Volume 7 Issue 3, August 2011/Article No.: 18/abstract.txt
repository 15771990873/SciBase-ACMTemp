This article presents a second-order derivative-based audio steganalysis. First, Mel-cepstrum coefficients and Markov transition features from the second-order derivative of the audio signal are extracted; a support vector machine is then applied to the features for discovering the existence of hidden data in digital audio streams. Also, the relation between audio signal complexity and steganography detection accuracy, which is an issue relevant to audio steganalysis performance evaluation but so far has not been explored, is analyzed experimentally. Results demonstrate that, in comparison with a recently proposed signal stream-based Mel-cepstrum method, the second-order derivative-based audio steganalysis method gains a considerable advantage under all categories of signal complexity--especially for audio streams with high signal complexity, which are generally the most challenging for steganalysis-and thereby significantly improves the state of the art in audio steganalysis.
