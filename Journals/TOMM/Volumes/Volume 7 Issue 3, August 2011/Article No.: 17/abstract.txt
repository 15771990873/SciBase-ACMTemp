The ability to create super high-resolution video is becoming relative easy to do either through a single high-definition video camera or panoramic video that automatically stitches multiple views together. As an example of the former, the motion picture industry now has 6000 Ã— 4000 pixel full-rate video cameras available. This means that supporting region-of-interest cropping will become more important in the future. In this article, we propose a mechanism to support region-of-interest adaptation of stored video. The proposed approach creates a compression-compliant stream (e.g., MPEG-2), while still allowing it to be cropped. Fortunately, video standards like MPEG-2 specify the format of a compliant stream, and not the algorithm to get there. As a result, there is an opportunity to allow system researchers and implementers ways to optimize for applications. We show various fundamental tradeoffs that are made in order to support region-of-interest cropping with super high-resolution video which we received from a local motion-picture firm.
