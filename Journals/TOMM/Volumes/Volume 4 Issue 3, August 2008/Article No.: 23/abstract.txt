This article designs a real-time perceptual compression system (RTPCS) based on eye-gaze-position analysis. Our results indicate that the eye-gaze-position containment metric provides more efficient and effective evaluation of an RTPCS than the eye fixation containment. The presented RTPCS is designed for a network communication scenario with a feedback loop delay. The proposed RTPCS uses human visual system properties to compensate for the delay and to provide high ratios of multimedia compression.
