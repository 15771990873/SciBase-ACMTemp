Eye movements can be used to infer the allocation of covert attention. In this article, we propose to model the allocation of attention in a task-dependent manner based on different eye movement conditions, specifically fixation and pursuit. We show that the image complexity at eye fixation points during fixation, and the pursuit direction during pursuit are significant factors in attention allocation. Results of the study are applied to the design of an interactive computer game. Real-time eye movement information is taken as one of inputs for the game. The utility of such eye information for controlling game difficulty is shown.
