In this article, a novel criterion-based multilayer access control (CBMAC) approach is presented to enhance existing access control models such as Role-Based, Mandatory, and Discretionary Access Control models to support multilayer (multilevel) access control. The proposed approach is based on a set of predefined security criteria which are extracted from authorization rules. The security attributes of objects and users are specified by security criterion expressions (serving as locks) and the elements (serving as keys) of security criterion subsets respectively. An object embedded with a number of security criterion expressions becomes a secure object while a user associated with a security criterion subset is called a secure user. The multilayer access control is achieved by evaluating the embedded security criterion expressions (actuating locks) by the elements (keys) in a user's security criterion subset. The paper also provides the details of integrating the proposed approach with existing access control models and presents the implementation considerations of Criterion-Based Role-Based Multilayer Access Control, the integration of CBMAC and Role-Based Access Control.
