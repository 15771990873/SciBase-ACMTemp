With advance in mobile 3D display, mobile 3D video is already enabled by the wireless multimedia networking, and it will be gradually popular since it can make people enjoy the natural 3D experience anywhere and anytime. In current stage, mobile 3D video is generally delivered over the heterogeneous network combined by wired and wireless channels. How to guarantee the optimal 3D visual quality of experience (QoE) for the mobile 3D video streaming is one of the important topics concerned by the service provider. In this article, we propose a QoE-oriented transcoding approach to enhance the quality of mobile 3D video service. By learning the pre-controlled QoE patterns of 3D contents, the proposed 3D visual QoE inferring model can be utilized to regulate the transcoding configurations in real-time according to the feedbacks of network and user-end device information. In the learning stage, we propose a piecewise linear mean opinion score (MOS) interpolation method to further reduce the cumbersome manual work of preparing QoE patterns. Experimental results show that the proposed transcoding approach can provide the adapted 3D stream to the heterogeneous network, and further provide superior QoE performance to the fixed quantization parameter (QP) transcoding and mean squared error (MSE) optimized transcoding for mobile 3D video streaming.
