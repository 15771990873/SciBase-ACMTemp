This article presents a psychophysical study that measures the perceptual thresholds of a new factor called Color-plus-Depth Level-of-Details (CZLoD) peculiar to polygon-based 3D tele-immersive video. The results demonstrate the existence of Just Noticeable Degradation and Just Unacceptable Degradation thresholds on the factor. In light of the results, we design and implement a real-time perception-based quality adaptor for 3D tele-immersive video. Our experimental results show that the adaptation scheme can reduce resource usage (e.g., CPU cycles) while considerably enhancing the overall perceived visual quality. Our analysis confirms the potential temporal and spatial performance benefits achievable with CZLoD adaptation.
