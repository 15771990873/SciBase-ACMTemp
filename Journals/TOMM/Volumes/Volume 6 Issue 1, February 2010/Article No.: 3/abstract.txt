Considerable research has been done on the content-based multimedia delivery and access in distributed data repositories. As noted in the literature, there is always a trade-off between multimedia quality and access speed. In addition, the overall performance is greatly determined by the distribution of the multimedia data. In this article, an unsupervised multimedia semantic integration approach for a distributed infrastructure, the Distributed Semantic Indexing (DSI), is presented that addresses both the data quality and search performance. With the ability of summarizing content information and guiding data distribution, the proposed approach is distinguished by: (1) logic-based representation and concise abstraction of the semantic contents of multimedia data, which are further integrated to form a general overview of a multimedia data repositoryâ€”content signature; (2) application of linguistic relationships to construct a hierarchical metadata based on the content signatures allowing imprecise queries; and (3) achieving the optimal performance in terms of search cost. The fundamental structure of the proposed model is presented. The proposed scheme has been simulated and the simulation results are analyzed and compared against several other approaches that have been advocated in the literature.
