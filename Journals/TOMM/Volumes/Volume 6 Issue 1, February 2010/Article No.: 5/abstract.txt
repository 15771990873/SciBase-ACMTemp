This article presents a novel real-time algorithm for reducing and dynamically controlling the computational complexity of an H.264 video encoder implemented in software. A fast mode decision algorithm, based on a Pareto-optimal macroblock classification scheme, is combined with a dynamic complexity control algorithm that adjusts the MB class decisions such that a constant frame rate is achieved. The average coding efficiency of the proposed algorithm was found to be similar to that of conventional encoding operating at half the frame rate. The proposed algorithm was found to provide lower average bitrate and distortion than static complexity scaling.
