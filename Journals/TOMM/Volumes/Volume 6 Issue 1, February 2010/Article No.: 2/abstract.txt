The article addresses the problem of copyright protection for 3D motion-captured data by designing a robust blind watermarking mechanism. The mechanism segments motion capture data and identifies clusters of 3D points per segment. A watermark can be embedded and extracted within these clusters by using a proposed extension of 3D quantization index modulation. The watermarking scheme is blind in nature and the encoded watermarks are shown to be imperceptible, and secure. The resulting hiding capacity has bounds based on cluster size. The watermarks are shown to be robust against attacks such as uniform affine transformations (scaling, rotation, and translation), cropping, reordering, and noise addition. The time complexity for watermark embedding and extraction is estimated as O(nlogn) and O(n2logn), respectively.
