At present, mobile devices are prevalent with end users and continuous media streaming services in mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) support popular applications. It is required for applications that stream isochronous media that the network link be continuously available. In this study, we introduce two group-server scheduling schemes to improve link continuity:static group-server schedulinganddynamic group-server scheduling. With our solution, if one of the current links between a client and a server instance breaks, the client can still download the multimedia content from another scheduled server peer. In addition, we incorporate the data link layer constraints as well as privacy concerns into our protocol design. The simulation results show that the proposed schemes significantly improve the effective link duration, overall system performance, and degree of privacy in MANETs.
