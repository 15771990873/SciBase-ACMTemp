A multistage procedure to detect eye features is presented. Multiresolution and topographic classification are used to detect the iris center. The eye corner is calculated combining valley detection and eyelid curve extraction. The algorithm is tested in the BioID database and in a proprietary database containing more than 1200 images. The results show that the suggested algorithm is robust and accurate. Regarding the iris center our method obtains the best average behavior for the BioID database compared to other available algorithms. Additional contributions are that our algorithm functions in real time and does not require complex post processing stages.
