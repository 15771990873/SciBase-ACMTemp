The research area of interactive digital TV is in the midst of a significant revival. Unlike the first generation of digital TV, which focused on producer concerns that effectively limited (re)distribution, the current generation of research is closely linked to the role of the user in selecting, producing, and distributing content. The research field of interactive digital television is being transformed into a study of human-centered television. Our guest editorial reviews relevant aspects of this transformation in the three main stages of the content lifecycle: content production, content delivery, and content consumption. While past research on content production tools focused on full-fledged authoring tools for professional editors, current research studies lightweight, often informal end-user authoring systems. In terms of content delivery, user-oriented infrastructures such as peer-to-peer are being seen as alternatives to more traditional broadcast solutions. Moreover, end-user interaction is no longer limited to content selection, but now facilitates nonlinear participatory television productions. Finally, user-to-user communication technologies have allowed television to become a central component of an interconnected social experience. The background context given in this article provides a framework for appreciating the significance of four detailed contributions that highlight important directions in transforming interactive television research.
