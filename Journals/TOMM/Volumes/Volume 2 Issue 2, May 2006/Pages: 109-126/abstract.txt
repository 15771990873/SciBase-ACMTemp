In this article we study a smooth and efficient transport protocol for real-time video over wireless networks. The proposed scheme, named the video transport protocol (VTP), has a new and unique end-to-end rate control mechanism that aims to avoid drastic rate fluctuations while maintaining friendliness to legacy protocols. VTP is also equipped with an achieved rate estimation scheme and a loss discrimination algorithm, both end-to-end, to cope with random errors in wireless networks efficiently. We show by analysis that VTP preserves most of the convergence properties of AIMD and converges to its fair share fast. VTP is compared to two recent TCP friendly rate control (TFRC) extensions, namely TFRC Wireless and MULTFRC, in wired-cum-wireless scenarios in Ns-2. Results show that VTP excels in all tested scenarios in terms of smoothness, fairness, and opportunistic friendliness. VTP is also implemented to work with a video camera and an H.263 video codec as part of our hybrid testbed, where its good performance as a transport layer protocol is confirmed by measurement results.
