For the past decade, there have been numerous research works focusing on the protection of digital images, audio, video, 3D virtual scenes, and software data from unauthorized use and distribution. With the emerging technology of the MPEG-4 standard, MPEG-4 scenes that may include images, video, audio, and 3D objects can easily be built using the text-based MPEG-4 XMT standard. XMT allows content authors to exchange their content with other authors, tools, or service providers and facilitates interoperability with MPEG-4, X3D, and SMIL. In order for owners and designers to protect and/or authenticate their work, some form of security needs to be applied into the MPEG-4 XMT structure and its media content. Unlike images or videos, watermarking an XMT structure is not an easy task, since the structure contains no noise components to embed the watermark. This article is the first one proposing a novel robust algorithm for the authentication of a given MPEG-4 XMT structured scene and the location of its multimedia content.
