We consider the problem of flow coordination in distributed multimedia applications. Most transport-level protocols are designed to operate independently and lack mechanisms for sharing information with other flows and coordinating data transport in various ways. This limitation becomes problematic in distributed applications that employ numerous flows between two computing clusters sharing the same intermediary forwarding path across the Internet. In this article, we propose an open architecture that supports the sharing of network state information, peer flow information, and application-specific information. Called simply thecoordination protocol (CP), the scheme facilitates coordination of network resource usage across flows belonging to the same application, as well as aiding other types of coordination. The effectiveness of our approach is illustrated in the context of multistreaming in 3D tele-immersion where consistency of network information across flows both greatly improves frame transport synchrony and minimizes buffering delay.
