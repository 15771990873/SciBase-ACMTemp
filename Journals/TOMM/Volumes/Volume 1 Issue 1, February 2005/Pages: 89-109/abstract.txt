Authoring context sensitive, interactive multimedia presentations is much more complex than authoring either purely audiovisual applications or text. Interactions among media objects need to be described as a set of spatio-temporal relationships that account for synchronous and asynchronous interactions, as well as on-demand linking behavior. This article considers the issues that need to be addressed by an authoring environment. We begin with a partitioning of concerns based on seven classes of authoring problems. We then describe a selection of multimedia authoring environments within four different authoring paradigms: structured, timeline, graph and scripting. We next provide observations and insights into the authoring process and argue that the structured paradigm provides the most useful framework for presentation authoring. We close with an example application of the structured multimedia authoring paradigm in the context of our own structure-based system GRiNS.
