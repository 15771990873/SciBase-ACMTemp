Salient Stills are a class of images that reflect the aggregation of the temporal changes that occur in a moving-image sequence with the salient features of individual frames preserved. They convey the intended expression of an entire series of moving frames---a visual summary of camera and object movements. The original frames, which may include variations in focal length or field of view, or moving objects, are combined to create a single still image. The still image may have multiresolution patches, a larger field of view, or higher overall resolution than any individual frame in the original image sequence. Salient Stills may also contain selected significant objects from individual or multiple video frames. Salient Stills attempt to retain much of the original content (detail) and spatial and temporal extent (context) of the original video or film sequence.
