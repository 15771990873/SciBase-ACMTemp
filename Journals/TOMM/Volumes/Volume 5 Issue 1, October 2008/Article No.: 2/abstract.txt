This article presents an approach to postprocessing casually captured videos to improve apparent camera movement.Re-cinematographytransforms each frame of a video such that the video better follows cinematic conventions. The approach breaks a video into shorter segments. Segments of the source video where there is no intentional camera movement are made to appear as if the camera is completely static. For segments with camera motions, camera paths are keyframed automatically and interpolated with matrix logarithms to give velocity-profiled movements that appear intentional and directed. Closeups are inserted to provide compositional variety in otherwise uniform segments. The approach automatically balances the tradeoff between motion smoothness and distortion to the original imagery. Results from our prototype show improvements to poor quality home videos.
