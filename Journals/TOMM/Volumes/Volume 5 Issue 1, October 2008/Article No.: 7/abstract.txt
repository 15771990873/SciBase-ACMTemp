The explosion of multimedia data necessitates effective and efficient ways for us to get access to our desired ones. In this article, we draw an analogy between image retrieval and text retrieval and propose a visual phrase-based approach to retrieve images containing desired objects (object-based image retrieval). The visual phrase is defined as a pair of frequently co-occurred adjacent local image patches and is constructed using data mining. We design methods on how to construct visual phrase and how to index/search images based on visual phrase. We demonstrate experiments to show our visual phrase-based approach can be very efficient and more effective than current visual word-based approach.
