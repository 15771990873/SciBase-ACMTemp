NAND flash memory has become one of the most popular storage media for mobile multimedia systems. A key issue in designing storage systems for mobile multimedia systems is handling large-capacity storage media and numerous large files with limited resources such as memory. However, existing flash file systems, including JFFS2 and YAFFS in particular, exhibit many limitations in addressing the storage capacity of mobile multimedia systems.In this article, we design and implement a scalable flash file system, called ScaleFFS, for mobile multimedia systems. ScaleFFS is designed to require only a small fixed amount of memory space and to provide fast mount time, even if the file system size grows to more than tens of gigabytes. The measurement results show that ScaleFFS can be instantly mounted regardless of the file system size, while achieving the same write bandwidth and up to 22&percnt; higher read bandwidth compared to JFFS2.
