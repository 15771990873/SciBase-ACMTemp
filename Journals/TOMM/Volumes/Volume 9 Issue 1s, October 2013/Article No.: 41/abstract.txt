The last great advances in immersive communication were the invention of the telephone over 137 years ago and the invention of the video telephone (n√© television) over 86 years ago. However, a perfect storm is brewing for the next advance in immersive communication, thanks to the convergence of massive amounts of computation, bandwidth, resolution, new sensors, and new displays. It could well be the Multimedia community that turns this brew into the next great advance in immersive communication, something akin to teleportation.
