This article presents a personalized narrative on the early discussions within the Multimedia community and the subsequent research on experiential media systems. I discuss two different research initiatives—design of real-time, immersive multimedia feedback environments for stroke rehabilitation; exploratory environments for events that exploited the user's ability to make connections. I discuss the issue of foundations: the question of multisensory integration and superadditivity; the need for identification of “first-class” Multimedia problems; expanding the scope of Multimedia research.
