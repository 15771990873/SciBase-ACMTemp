Online social networks have reshaped how multimedia contents are generated, distributed, and consumed on today's Internet. Given the massive number of user-generated contents shared in online social networks, users are moving to directly access these contents in their preferred social network services. It is intriguing to study the service provision of social contents for global users with satisfactory quality of experience. In this article, we conduct large-scale measurement of a real-world online social network system to study the social content propagation. We have observed important propagation patterns, including social locality, geographical locality, and temporal locality. Motivated by the measurement insights, we propose a propagation-based social-aware delivery framework using a hybrid edge-cloud and peer-assisted architecture. We also design replication strategies for the architecture based on three propagation predictors designed by jointly considering user, content, and context information. In particular, we design a propagation region predictor and a global audience predictor to guide how the edge-cloud servers backup the contents, and a local audience predictor to guide how peers cache the contents for their friends. Our trace-driven experiments further demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our design.
