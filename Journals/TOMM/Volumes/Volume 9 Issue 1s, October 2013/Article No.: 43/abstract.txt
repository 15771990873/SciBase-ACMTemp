This paper is a personal look back at twenty years of research in multimedia content analysis. It addresses the areas of audio, photo and video analysis for the purpose of indexing and retrieval from the perspective of a multimedia researcher. Whereas a general analysis of content is impossible due to the personal bias of the user, significant progress was made in the recognition of specific objects or events. The paper concludes with a brief outlook on the future.
