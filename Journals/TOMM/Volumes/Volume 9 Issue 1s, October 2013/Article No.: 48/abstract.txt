This article presents the idea of empathic stimulation that relies on the power and potential of unconsciously conveyed attentive and emotional information to facilitate human-machine interaction. Starting from a historical review of related work presented at past ACM Multimedia conferences, we discuss challenges that arise when exploiting unconscious human signals for empathic stimulation, such as the real-time analysis of psychological user states and the smooth adaptation of the human-machine interface based on this analysis. A classical application field that might benefit from the idea of unconscious human-computer interaction is the exploration of massive datasets.
