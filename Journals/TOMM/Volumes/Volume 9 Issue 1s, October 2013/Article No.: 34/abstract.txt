The evolution of multimedia applications has drastically changed human life and behaviors. New communication technologies lead to new requirements for multimedia synchronization. This article presents a historical view of temporal synchronization studies focusing on continuous multimedia. We demonstrate how the development of multimedia systems has created new challenges for synchronization technologies. We conclude with a new application-dependent, multilocation, multirequirement synchronization framework to address these new challenges.
