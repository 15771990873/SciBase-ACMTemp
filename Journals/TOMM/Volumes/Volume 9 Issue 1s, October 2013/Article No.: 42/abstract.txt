This article reviews the major research trends that emerged in the last two decades within the broad area of multimedia information retrieval, with a focus on the ACM Multimedia community. Trends are defined (nonscientifically) to be topics that appeared in ACM multimedia publications and have had a significant number of citations. The article also assesses the impacts of these trends on real-world applications. The views expressed are subjective and likely biased but hopefully useful for understanding the heritage of the community and stimulating new research direction.
