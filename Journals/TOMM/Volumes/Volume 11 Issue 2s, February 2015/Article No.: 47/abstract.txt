3DTI Amphitheater is a live broadcasting system for dissemination of 3DTI (3D Tele-immersive) content. The virtual environment constructed by the system mimics an amphitheater in the real world, where performers interact with each other in the central circular stage, and the audience is placed in virtual seats that surround the stage. Users of the Amphitheater can be geographically dispersed and the streams created by the performer sites are disseminated in a P2P network among the participants. To deal with the high bandwidth demand and strict latency bound of the service, we identify the hierarchical priority of streams in construction of the content dissemination forest. Result shows that the Amphitheater outperforms prior 3DTI systems by boosting the application QoS by a factor of 2.8 while sustaining the same hundred-scale audience group.
