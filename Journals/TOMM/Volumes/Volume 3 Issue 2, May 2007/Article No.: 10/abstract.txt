Due to the rapid growth of the number of digital images on the Web, there is an increasing demand for an effective and efficient method for organizing and retrieving the available images. This article describes iFind, a system for clustering and searching WWW images. By using a vision-based page segmentation algorithm, a Web page is partitioned into blocks, and the textual and link information of an image can be accurately extracted from the block containing that image. The textual information is used for image indexing. By extracting the page-to-block, block-to-image, block-to-page relationships through link structure and page layout analysis, we construct an image graph. Our method is less sensitive to noisy links than previous methods like PageRank, HITS, and PicASHOW, and hence the image graph can better reflect the semantic relationship between images. Using the notion of Markov Chain, we can compute the limiting probability distributions of the images, ImageRanks, which characterize the importance of the images. The ImageRanks are combined with the relevance scores to produce the final ranking for image search. With the graph models, we can also use techniques from spectral graph theory for image clustering and embedding, or 2-D visualization. Some experimental results on 11.6 million images downloaded from the Web are provided in the article.
