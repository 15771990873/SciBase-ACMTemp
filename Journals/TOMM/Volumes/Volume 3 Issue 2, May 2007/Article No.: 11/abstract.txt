This article proposes a novel video abstraction framework for online review services of story-oriented videos such as dramas. Among the many genres of TV programs, a drama is one of the most popularly watched on the Web. The abstracts generated by the proposed framework not only give a summary of a video but also effectively help viewers understand the overall story. In addition, our method is duration-flexible. We get clues about human understanding of a story from scenario writing rules and editorial techniques that are popularly used in the process of video production to explicitly express a narrative, and propose a new video abstraction model, called aNarrative Abstraction Model. The model effectively captures the narrative structure embedded in a story-oriented video and articulates the progress of the story in a weighted directed graph, called aNarrative Structure Graph (NSG). The model provides a basis for a flexible framework for abstract generation using the NSG as the intermediary representation of a video. Different abstracts can be appropriately generated based upon different user requirements. To show the effectiveness of the proposed model and method, we developed a video abstraction system realizing the framework, and successfully applied it to large volumes of TV dramas. The evaluation results show that the proposed framework is a feasible solution for online review services.
