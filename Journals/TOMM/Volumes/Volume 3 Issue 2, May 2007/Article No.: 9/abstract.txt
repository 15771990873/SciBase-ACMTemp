In this article, we propose “Family Ensemble,” a piano duo support system for a musically inept parent and his/her child who is a beginner at playing the piano. The system makes it easier for parents to correctly reproduce a given sequence of pitches along with the child's performance by using score tracking and note-replacement functions. The experiments with this support system showed that the parents can immediately participate in the piano duo. Furthermore, we found that during joint practices using Family Ensemble some subjects discussed musical ideas that they would not have talked about without using the system.
