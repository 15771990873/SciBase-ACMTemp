This article characterizes video-based interactions that emerge from YouTube's video response feature, which allows users to discuss themes and to provide reviews for products or places using much richer media than text. Based on crawled data covering a representative subset of videos and users, we present a characterization from two perspectives: the video response view and the interaction network view. In addition to providing valuable statistical models for various characteristics, our study uncovers typical user behavioral patterns in video-based environments and shows evidence of opportunistic behavior.
