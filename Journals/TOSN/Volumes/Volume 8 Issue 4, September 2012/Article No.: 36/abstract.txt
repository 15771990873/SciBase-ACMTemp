In wireless sensor networks, different applications feature different requirements in terms of such performance metrics as sensing coverage and data reporting latency. In most applications, it is usually sufficient to provide aDesired Sensing Coverage(DSC) lower than full coverage at any instance with the guarantee that the whole area will eventually be covered within a specified delay bound. Due to the fact that these applications are also expected to run for longer periods of time and at the same time battery recharging and replacement are costly, energy consumption in wireless sensor networks should be minimized while achieving the application goals. In this article, we propose a novel framework for application-specific data gathering which exploits a trade-off between coverage and latency, thereby minimizing energy consumption and extending the network lifetime. The proposed energy-efficient, constant-time, randomized scheme, calledCoverage-Adaptive raNdom SEnsor sElection(CANSEE), selects a subset ofksensors to report at each round so as to fulfill the application-specific requirement of desired sensing coverage and bounded latency, instead of always guaranteeing full coverage and minimum latency. We present a probabilistic model to estimate: (i) the connectivity of those selectedksensors and the number of additional sensors needed to guarantee connectivity; (ii) a lower bound onkin each round; and (iii) the probability of almost surely havingkdata reporters using the Chernoff bound. The immediate event detection capability achieved by the proposed CANSEE scheme is also analyzed to compare the performance of our framework with other data gathering schemes that allow 100&percnt; coverage. Simulation results demonstrate that our framework leads to a significant conservation of energy (and thus extended network lifetime) with a small trade-off between coverage and data reporting latency, yet providing the required data reporting capability.
