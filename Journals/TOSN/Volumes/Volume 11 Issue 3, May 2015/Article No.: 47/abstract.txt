In this article, we propose and analyze dynamic redundancy management of integrated intrusion detection and tolerance for lifetime maximization of homogeneous clustered wireless sensor networks (WSNs). We take a holistic approach of integrating multisource and multipath routing for intrusion tolerance with majority voting for intrusion detection in our redundancy management protocol design. By dynamically controlling the redundancy level for both multisource multipath routing and voting-based intrusion detection with energy consideration, we identify the optimal redundancy level to be applied to maximize the WSN lifetime in response to changing environment conditions including node density, radio range, and node capture rate. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our integrated redundancy management protocol by a comparative analysis with a multisource multipath routing algorithm called AFTQC that considers only fault/intrusion tolerance.
