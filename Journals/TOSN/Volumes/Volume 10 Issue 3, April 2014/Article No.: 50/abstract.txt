Most communication and localization algorithms in underwater environments have been constrained by dependencies on the Line Of Sight (LOS), which is hard to guarantee due to the inherent node mobility. This constraint hinders node discovery and ad hoc formation in underwater networks and limits the performance of routing protocols. This article introduces a novel Surface-Based Reflection (SBR) model that uses a homomorphic deconvolution technique to establish water-surface-reflected communication links. We then propose a Surface-Based Reflection Anchor-free Localization (SBR-AL) algorithm that can be employed by the individual nodes to establish a relative coordinate system. Our approach also employs a switch-beamed directional antenna model that allows each node to use the LOS estimated from SBR-AL to enable directional communication which is beneficial for higher Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR). The relative locations can facilitate the various network operation functions such as geo-routing and collision-free medium access. The simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
