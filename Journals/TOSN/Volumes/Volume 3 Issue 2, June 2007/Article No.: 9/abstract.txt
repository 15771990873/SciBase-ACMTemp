In this article we analyze the capabilities of various models of sensor networks with the Boolean sensing model for mobile or stationary sensors and targets, under random or optimal placement, independent or globally coordinated search, and stealthy or visible sensors. For each model we give an upper bound for the capabilities under any strategy, and a search strategy which at least asymptotically matches that bound. To ensure comparability of these models, we present them using the same parameters: the sensing radiusr, sensor placement density Î», as well as the travel distancelof each sensor anddof the target. By this we obtain a complete analysis of the geometric coverage and detection capabilities of the various models of sensor networks, where we abstract from issues like communication and power management.
