Wireless sensor networks are typically deployed in harsh environments, thus post-deployment failures are not infrequent. An execution trace containing events in their order of execution could play a crucial role in postmortem diagnosis of these failures. Obtaining such a trace however is challenging due to stringent resource constraints. We propose an efficient approach to intraprocedural and interprocedural control-flow tracing that generates traces of all interleaving concurrent events and of the control-flow paths taken inside those events. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with the help of case studies and illustrate its low overhead through measurements and simulations.
