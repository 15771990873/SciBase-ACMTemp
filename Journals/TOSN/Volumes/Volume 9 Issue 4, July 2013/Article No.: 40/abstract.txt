The problem of coverage is a fundamental issue in wireless sensor networks. In this article, we consider two subproblems:k-coverage contour evaluation andk-coverage rate deployment. The former aims to evaluate, up tok, the coverage level of any location inside a monitored area, while the latter aims to determine the locations of a given set of sensors to guarantee the maximum increment ofk-coverage rate when they are deployed into the area. For thek-coverage contour evaluation problem, a nonuniform-grid-based approach is proposed. We prove that the computation cost of our approach is at most the square root of existing solutions. Based on ourk-coverage contour evaluation scheme, a greedyk-coverage rate deployment scheme (k-CRD) is proposed, which is shown to be an order faster than existing studies fork-coverage rate deployment. Thek-CRD can incorporate two different heuristics to further reduce its running time. Simulation results show thatk-CRD with these heuristics can be significantly more time efficient without causing much degradation in the coverage rate of final deployment.
