Information aggregation is an important operation in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) executed for the purpose of monitoring and reporting environmental data. Due to the performance constraints of sensor nodes the in-network form of the aggregation is especially attractive since it allows saving expensive resources during frequent network queries. Easy accessibility of networks and nodes and almost no physical protection against corruptions raise high security challenges. Protection against attacks aiming to falsify the aggregated result is considered to be of prime importance.In this article we design the first general framework for secure information aggregation in WSNs focusing on scenarios where aggregation is performed by one of its nodes. The framework achieves security against node corruptions and is based solely on the symmetric cryptographic primitives that are more suitable for WSNs in terms of efficiency. We analyze performance of the framework and unlike many previous approaches increase confidence in it by a rigorous proof of security within the specially designedformal security model.
