A model for segmentation of an object space by an array of binary, radiation-field sensors and geometric reference structures is described. Given a family of binary, radiation-field sensors and a geometric reference structure, we refer to the set of sensor states induced by a source at pointpas the signature ofp. We study the segmentation of an object space into signature cells and prove near optimal bounds on the number of distinct signatures induced by a point source, as a function of sensor and reference structure complexity. We also show that almost any family of signatures can be implemented under this model.
