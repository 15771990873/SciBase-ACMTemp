Applications that exploit the capabilities of sensor networks have triggered significant research on query processing in sensor systems. Energy constraints make optimizing query processing particularly important. This article addresses multiroot, multiquery optimization for region queries. The work focuses on application-layer issues exploiting query semantics. The article formulates three algorithms: a na√Øve algorithm, without data sharing, and a static and heuristic data-sharing algorithm. The heuristic algorithm allows sharing of partially aggregated results of preconfigured geographic regions and exploits the location attribute of sensor nodes as a grouping criterion. Simulation studies indicate the potential for significant energy savings with the proposed algorithms.
