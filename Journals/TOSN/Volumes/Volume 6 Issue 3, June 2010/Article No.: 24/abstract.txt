Wireless sensor network (WSN) applications have been studied extensively in recent years. Such applications involve resource-limited embedded sensor nodes that have small size and low power requirements. Based on the need for extended network lifetimes in WSNs in terms of energy use, the energy efficiency of computation and communication operations in the sensor nodes becomes critical. Digital Signal Processing (DSP) applications typically require intensive data processing operations and as a result are difficult to implement directly in resource-limited WSNs. In this article, we present a novel design methodology for modeling and implementing computationally intensive DSP applications applied to wireless sensor networks. This methodology explores efficient modeling techniques for DSP applications, including data sensing and processing; derives formulations of Energy-Driven Partitioning (EDP) for distributing such applications across wireless sensor networks; and develops efficient heuristic algorithms for finding partitioning results that maximize the network lifetime. To address such an energy-driven partitioning problem, this article provides a new way of aggregating data and reducing communication traffic among nodes based on application analysis. By considering low data token delivery points and the distribution of computation in the application, our approach finds energy-efficient trade-offs between data communication and computation.
