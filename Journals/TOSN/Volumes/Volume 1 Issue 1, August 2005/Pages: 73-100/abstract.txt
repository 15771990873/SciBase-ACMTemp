Many distributed monitoring applications of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) require the location information of a sensor node. In this article, we address the problem of enabling nodes of Wireless Sensor Networks to determine their location in an untrusted environment, known as thesecure localization problem.We propose a novel range-independent localization algorithm called SeRLoc that is well suited to a resource constrained environment such as a WSN. SeRLoc is a distributed algorithm based on a two-tier network architecture that allows sensors to passively determine their location without interacting with other sensors. We show that SeRLoc is robust against known attacks on a WSNs such as thewormhole attack, theSybil attack, andcompromise of network entitiesand analytically compute the probability of success for each attack. We also compare the performance of SeRLoc with state-of-the-art range-independent localization schemes and show that SeRLoc has better performance.
