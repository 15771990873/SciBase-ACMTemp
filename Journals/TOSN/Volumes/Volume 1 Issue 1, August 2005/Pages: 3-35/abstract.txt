We develop distributed algorithms for adaptive sensor networks that respond to directing a target through a region of space. We model this problem as an online distributed motion planning problem. Each sensor node senses values in its perception space and has the ability to trigger exceptions events we call “danger” and model as “obstacles”. The danger/obstacle landscape changes over time. We present algorithms for computing distributed maps in perception space and for using these maps to compute adaptive paths for a mobile node that can interact with the sensor network. We give the analysis to the protocol and report on hardware experiments using a physical sensor network consisting of Mote sensors. We also show how to reduce searching space and communication cost using Voronoi diagram.
