In this article we propose a lightweight algorithm for constructing multiresolution data representations for sensor networks. At each sensor nodeu, we computeO(logn) aggregates about exponentially enlarging neighborhoods centered atu. Theith aggregate is the aggregated data from nodes approximately within 2ihops ofu. We present a scheme, named thehierarchical spatial gossip algorithm, to extract and construct these aggregates, forallsensors simultaneously, with a total communication cost ofO(npolylogn). The hierarchical gossip algorithm adopts atomic communication steps with each node choosing to exchange information with a node distancedaway with probability ∼ 1/d3. The attractiveness of the algorithm can be attributed to its simplicity, low communication cost, distributed nature, and robustness to node failures and link failures. We show in addition that computing multiresolution aggregates precisely (i.e., each aggregate uses all and only the nodes within 2ihops) requires a communication cost of Ω(n√n), which does not scale well with network size. An approximate range in aggregate computation like that introduced by the gossip mechanism is therefore necessary in a scalable efficient algorithm. Besides the natural applications of multiresolution data summaries in data validation and information mining, we also demonstrate the application of the precomputed multiresolution data summaries in answering range queries efficiently.
