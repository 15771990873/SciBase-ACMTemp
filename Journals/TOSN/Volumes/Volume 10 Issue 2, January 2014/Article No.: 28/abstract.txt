Interference model is the basis of MAC protocol design in wireless networked sensing and control, and it directly affects the efficiency and predictability of wireless messaging. To exploit the strengths of both the physical and the protocol interference models, we analyze how network traffic, link length, and wireless signal attenuation affect the optimal instantiation of the protocol model. We also identify the inherent trade-off between reliability and throughput in the model instantiation. Our analysis sheds light on the open problem of efficiently optimizing the protocol model instantiation. Based on the analytical results, we propose the physical-ratio-K (PRK) interference model as a reliability-oriented instantiation of the protocol model. Via analysis, simulation, and testbed-based measurement, we show that PRK-based scheduling achieves a network throughput very close to (e.g., 95&percnt;) what is enabled by physical-model-based scheduling while ensuring the required packet delivery reliability. The PRK model inherits both the high fidelity of the physical model and the locality of the protocol model, thus it is expected to be suitable for distributed protocol design. These findings shed new light on wireless interference models; they also suggest new approaches to MAC protocol design in the presence of uncertainties in network and environmental conditions as well as application QoS requirements.
