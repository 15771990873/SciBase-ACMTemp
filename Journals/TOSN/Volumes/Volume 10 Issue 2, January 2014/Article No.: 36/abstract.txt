Emerging multimedia applications for sensor networks require the co-existence of different types of traffic with different QoS provisions in terms of latency and throughput. Prioritization-based service differentiation mechanisms are applied in all layers of communication to satisfy the QoS requirements of each traffic class. The prioritization in the contention is one of these differentiation methods applied in the medium access layer. In this article, we propose an analytical model for the contention latencies and energy expenditures of different classes in a prioritized contention structure with uniform backoff scheme. The contention window is divided into three partitions which are allocated for the use of only high-priority, both priorities, and only low-priority classes. We further generalize the model for binary exponential backoff schemes and for more than two priority classes. In the analysis, we explore the optimum sizes of these partitions in terms of contention latency and the total energy expenditure for each priority class. Our model is also useful for the evaluation of various recent contention prioritization schemes in WSNs.
