Accurate, distributed localization algorithms are needed for a wide variety of wireless sensor network applications. This article introduces a scalable, distributed weighted-multidimensional scaling (dwMDS) algorithm that adaptively emphasizes the most accurate range measurements and naturally accounts for communication constraints within the sensor network. Each node adaptively chooses a neighborhood of sensors, updates its position estimate by minimizing a local cost function and then passes this update to neighboring sensors. Derived bounds on communication requirements provide insight on the energy efficiency of the proposed distributed method versus a centralized approach. For received signal-strength (RSS) based range measurements, we demonstrate via simulation that location estimates are nearly unbiased with variance close to the Cram√©r-Rao lower bound. Further, RSS and time-of-arrival (TOA) channel measurements are used to demonstrate performance as good as the centralized maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE) in a real-world sensor network.
