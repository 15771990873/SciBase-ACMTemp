This article describes iDiary, a system that takes as input GPS data streams generated by users’ phones and turns them into textual descriptions of the trajectories. The system features a user interface similar to Google Search that allows users to type text queries on their activities (e.g., “Where did I buy books?”) and receive textual answers based on their GPS signals. iDiary uses novel algorithms for semantic compression and trajectory clustering of massive GPS signals in parallel to compute the critical locations of a user. We encode these problems as follows. Thek-segment meanis ak-piecewise linear function that minimizes the regression distance to the signal. The (k,m)-segment meanhas an additional constraint that the projection of theksegments on Rdconsists of onlym≤ksegments. A coreset for this problem is a smart compression of the input signal that allows computation of a (1+&varepsilon;)-approximation to itsk-segment or (k,m)-segment mean inO(nlogn) time for arbitrary constants &varepsilon;,k, andm. We use coresets to obtain a parallel algorithm that scans the signal in one pass, using space and update time per point that is polynomial in logn. Using an external database, we then map these locations to textual descriptions and activities so that we can apply text mining techniques on the resulting data (e.g., LSA or transportation mode recognition). We provide experimental results for both the system and algorithms and compare them to existing commercial and academic state of the art. This is the first GPS system that enables text-searchable activities from GPS data.
