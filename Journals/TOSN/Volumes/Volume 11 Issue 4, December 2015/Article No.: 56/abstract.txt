Sensor nodes deployed outdoors for field surveillance are subject to environmental detriments. In this article, we propose a heterogeneous sensor network composed of sensor nodes with different environmental survivability to make it robust to environmental damage and keep it at a reasonable cost. We, for the first time, study the scheduling problem in such heterogeneous sensor networks for critical location surveillance applications. Our goal is to monitor all the critical points for as long as possible under different environmental conditions. We identify the underlying problem, theoretically prove its NP-complete nature, and propose a novel adaptive greedy scheduling algorithm to solve the problem. The algorithm incorporates several heuristics to schedule the activity of both regular and robust sensors to monitor all the critical points, while at the same time minimizing and balancing the network energy consumption. Simulation results show that our algorithm efficiently solves the problem and outperforms other alternatives.
