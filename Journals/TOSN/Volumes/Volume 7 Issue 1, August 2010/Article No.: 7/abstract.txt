Advances in microprocessors, memory, and radio technology have enabled the emergence of embedded systems that rely on communication systems to exchange information and coordinate their activities in spatially distributed applications. However, developing embedded communication systems that satisfy specific application requirements is a challenge due to the many tradeoffs imposed by different choices of underlying protocols and their parameters. Furthermore, evaluating the correctness and performance of the design and implementation before deploying it is a nontrivial task due to the complexity of the resulting system. This article presents the design and implementation of RaPTEX, a rapid prototyping tool for embedded communication systems, especially well suited for wireless sensor networks (WSNs), consisting of three major subsystems: a toolbox, an analytical performance estimation framework, and an emulation environment. We use a hierarchical approach in the design of the toolbox to facilitate the composition of the network stack. For fast exploration of the tradeoff space at design time, we build an analytical performance estimation model for energy consumption, delay, and throughput. For realistic performance evaluation, we design and implement a hybrid, accurate, yet scalable, emulation environment. Through three use cases, we study the tradeoff space for different protocols and topologies, and highlight the benefits of using RaPTEX for designing and evaluating embedded communication systems for WSNs.
