Mobile wireless sensors require position updates for tracking and navigation. We present a localization technique that uses the Doppler shift in radio transmission frequency observed by stationary sensors. We consider two scenarios. In the first, the mobile node is carried by a person. In the second, the mobile node controls a robot. In both approaches the mobile node transmits an RF signal, and infrastructure nodes measure the Doppler-shifted frequency. Such measurements enable us to calculate the position and velocity of the mobile transmitter. Our experimental results demonstrate that this technique is viable and accurate for resource-constrained mobile sensor tracking and navigation.
