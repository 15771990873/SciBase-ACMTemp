This article presents the design and implementation of a trusted sensor node that provides Internet-grade security at low system cost. We describe trustedFleck, which uses a commodity Trusted Platform Module (TPM) chip to extend the capabilities of a standard wireless sensor node to provide security services such asmessage integrity, confidentiality, authenticity, andsystem integritybased on RSA public-key and XTEA-based symmetric-key cryptography. In addition trustedFleck provides secure storage of private keys and provides platform configuration registers (PCRs) to store system configurations and detect code tampering. We analyze system performance using metrics that are important for WSN applications such as computation time, memory size, energy consumption and cost. Our results show that trustedFleck significantly outperforms previous approaches (e.g., TinyECC) in terms of these metrics while providing stronger security levels. Finally, we describe a number of examples, built on trustedFleck, of symmetric key management, secure RPC, secure software update, andremote attestation.
