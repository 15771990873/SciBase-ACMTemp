Duty cycling improves energy efficiency but limits throughput and introduces significant end-to-end delay in wireless sensor networks. In this article, we present a traffic-adaptive synchronous MAC protocol (TAS-MAC), which is a high-throughput, low-delay MAC protocol tailored for low power consumption. It achieves high throughput by adapting time division multiple access (TDMA) to a novel traffic-adaptive allocation mechanism that assigns time slots only to nodes located on active routes. TAS-MAC reduces the end-to-end delay by notifying all nodes on active routes of incoming traffic in advance. These nodes will claim time slots for data transmission and forward a packet through multiple hops in a cycle. The desirable traffic-adaptive feature is achieved by decomposing traffic notification and data-transmission scheduling into two phases, specializing their duties and improving their efficiency, respectively. Simulation results and experiments on TelosB motes demonstrate that the two-phase design significantly improves the throughput of current synchronous MAC protocols and achieves the similar low delay of slot-stealing-assisted TDMA with much lower power consumption.
