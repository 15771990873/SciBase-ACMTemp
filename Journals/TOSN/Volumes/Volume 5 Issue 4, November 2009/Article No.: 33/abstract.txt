Local storage is required in many sensor network applications, both for archival of detailed event information, as well as to overcome sensor platform memory constraints. Recent gains in energy efficiency of new-generation NAND flash storage have strengthened the case for in-network storage by data-centric sensor network applications. We argue that current storage solutions offering a simple file system abstraction are inadequate for sensor applications to exploit storage. Instead, we propose Capsuleâ€”a rich, flexible and portable object storage abstraction that offers stream, file, array, queue and index storage objects for data storage and retrieval. Further, Capsule supports checkpointing and rollback of object state for fault tolerance. Our experiments demonstrate that Capsule provides platform independence, greater functionality and greater energy efficiency than existing storage solutions.
