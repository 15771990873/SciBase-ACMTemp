We study the problem of localizing a large sensor network having a complex shape, possibly with holes. A major challenge with respect to such networks is to figure out the correct network layout, that is, avoid global flips where a part of the network folds on top of another. Our algorithm first selects landmarks on network boundaries with sufficient density, then constructs the landmark Voronoi diagram and its dual combinatorial Delaunay complex on these landmarks. The key insight is that the combinatorial Delaunay complex is provablyglobally rigidand has auniquerealization in the plane. Thus an embedding of the landmarks by simply gluing the Delaunay triangles properly recovers the faithful network layout. With the landmarks nicely localized, the rest of the nodes can easily localize themselves by trilateration to nearby landmark nodes. This leads to a practical and accurate localization algorithm for large networks using only network connectivity. Simulations on various network topologies show surprisingly good results. In comparison, previous connectivity-based localization algorithms such as multidimensional scaling and rubberband representation generate globally flipped or distorted localization results.
