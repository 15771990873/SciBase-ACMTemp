This tutorial presents a detailed study of sensor faults that occur in deployed sensor networks and a systematic approach to model these faults. We begin by reviewing the fault detection literature for sensor networks. We draw from current literature, our own experience, and data collected from scientific deployments to develop a set of commonly used features useful in detecting and diagnosing sensor faults. We use this feature set to systematically define commonly observed faults, and provide examples of each of these faults from sensor data collected at recent deployments.
