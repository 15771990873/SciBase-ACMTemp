We present BikeNet, a mobile sensing system for mapping the cyclist experience. Built leveraging the MetroSense architecture to provide insight into the real-world challenges of people-centric sensing, BikeNet uses a number of sensors embedded into a cyclist's bicycle to gather quantitative data about the cyclist's rides. BikeNet uses a dual-mode operation for data collection, using opportunistically encountered wireless access points in a delay-tolerant fashion by default, and leveraging the cellular data channel of the cyclist's mobile phone for real-time communication as required. BikeNet also provides a Web-based portal for each cyclist to access various representations of her data, and to allow for the sharing of cycling-related data (for example, favorite cycling routes) within cycling interest groups, and data of more general interest (for example, pollution data) with the broader community. We present: a description and prototype implementation of the system architecture based on customized Moteiv Tmote Invent motes and sensor-enabled Nokia N80 mobile phones; an evaluation of sensing and inference that quantifies cyclist performance and the cyclist environment; a report on networking performance in an environment characterized by bicycle mobility and human unpredictability; and a description of BikeNet system user interfaces.
