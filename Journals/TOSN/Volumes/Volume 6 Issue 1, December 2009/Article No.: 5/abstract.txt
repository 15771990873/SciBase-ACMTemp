Cooperative communications represent a potential candidate to combat the effects of channel fading and to increase the transmit energy efficiency in wireless sensor networks with the downside being the increased complexity. In sensor networks the power consumed in the receiving and processing circuitry can constitute a significant portion of the total consumed power. By taking into consideration such overhead, an analytical framework for studying the energy efficiency trade-off of cooperation in sensor networks is presented. This trade-off is shown to depend on several parameters such as the receive and processing power, the required quality-of-service, the power amplifier loss, and several other factors. The analytical and numerical results reveal that for small distance separation between the source and destination, direct transmission is more energy efficient than relaying. The results also reveal that equal power allocation performs as well as optimal power allocation for some scenarios. The effects of the relay location and the number of employed relays on energy efficiency are also investigated in this work. Moreover, there are experimental results conducted to verify the channel model assumed in the article.
