Broadcast authentication is an important functionality in sensor networks. Energy constraints on sensor nodes and the real-time nature of the broadcasts render many of the existing solutions impractical: previous works focusing primarily on symmetric key schemes have difficulties in achieving real-time authentication. Public Key Cryptography (PKC), however, can satisfy the real-time requirements, and recent trends indicate that public key is becoming feasible for sensor networks.However, PKC operations are still expensive computations. It is impractical to use PKC in the conventional ways for broadcast authentication in sensor networks. To reduce costs, we proposeShortPK, an efficient Short-term Public Key broadcast authentication scheme. The basic idea is to use short-length public/private keys, but limit their lifetime to only a short period of time. To cover a long period of time, we need to use many public/private key pairs; distributing these public keys to sensors is a challenging problem. We describe a progressive key distribution scheme that is secure, efficient, and packet-loss resilient. We compare our scheme with the traditional 160-bit ECC public key schemes, and show that our scheme can achieve a significant improvement on energy consumption.
