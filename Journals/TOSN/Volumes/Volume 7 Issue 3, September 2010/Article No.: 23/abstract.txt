The exposure of a pathpin a sensor field is a measure of the likelihood that an object traveling alongpis detected by at least one sensor from a network of sensors, and is formally defined as an integral over all pointsxofpof the sensibility (the strength of the signal coming fromx) times the element of path length. The minimum exposure path (MEP) problem is, given a pair of pointsxandyinside a sensor field, to find a path betweenxandyof minimum exposure. In this article we introduce the first rigorous treatment of the problem, designing an approximation algorithm for the MEP problem with guaranteed performance characteristics. Given a convex polygonPof sizenwithO(n)sensors inside it and any real number &epsis;>0, our algorithm finds a path inPwhose exposure is within an 1+&epsis; factor of the exposure of the MEP, in timeO(n/&epsis;2ψlogn), where ψ is a geometric characteristic of the field. We also describe a framework for a faster implementation of our algorithm, which reduces the time by a factor of approximately θ(1/&epsis;), while keeping the same approximation ratio.
