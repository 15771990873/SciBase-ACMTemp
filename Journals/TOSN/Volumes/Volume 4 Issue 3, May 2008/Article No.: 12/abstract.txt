Recent experimental studies have shown that wireless links in real sensor networks can be extremely unreliable, deviating to a large extent from the idealized perfect-reception-within-range models used in common network simulation tools. Previously proposed geographic routing protocols commonly employ a maximum-distance greedy forwarding technique that works well in ideal conditions. However, such a forwarding technique performs poorly in realistic conditions as it tends to forward packets on lossy links. Based on a recently developed link loss model, we study the performance of a wide array of forwarding strategies, via analysis, extensive simulations and a set of experiments on motes. We find that the product of the packet reception rate and the distance improvement towards destination (PRRÃ—d) is a highly suitable metric for geographic forwarding in realistic environments.
