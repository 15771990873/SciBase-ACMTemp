We address the problem of optimal node activation in a sensor network, where the optimization objective is represented as a global time-average utility function over the deployment area of the network. Each sensor node is rechargeable, and can hold up toKquanta of energy. When the recharge and/or discharge processes in the network are random, the problem of optimal sensor activation is a complex stochastic decision question. For the case of identical sensor coverages, we show the existence of a simplethreshold policywhich isasymptotically optimalwith respect to the energy bucket sizeK, that is, the performance of this threshold policy approaches the optimal performance asKbecomes large. We also show that the performance of the optimal threshold policy is robust to the degree of spatial correlation in the discharge and/or recharge processes. We then extend this approach to a general sensor network where coverage areas of different sensors could have complete, partial or no overlap with each other. We demonstrate through simulations that a local information based threshold policy, with an appropriately chosen threshold, achieves a performance which is very close to the global optimum.
