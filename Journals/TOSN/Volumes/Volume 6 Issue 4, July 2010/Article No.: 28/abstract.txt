In data collection applications of low-end sensor networks, a major challenge is ensuring reliability without a significant goodput degradation. Short hops over high-quality links minimize per-hop transmissions, but long routes may cause congestion and load imbalance. Longer links can be exploited to build shorter routes, but poor links may have a high energy cost. There exists a complex interplay among routing performance (reliability, goodput, energy efficiency), link estimation, congestion control, and load balancing; we design a routing architecture, Arbutus, that exploits this interplay, and perform an extensive experimental evaluation on testbeds of 100-150 Berkeley motes.
