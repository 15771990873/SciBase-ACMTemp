We present a novel approach to localization of sensors in a network given a subset of noisy inter-sensor distances. The algorithm is based on “stitching” together local structures by solving an optimization problem requiring the structures to fit together in an “As-Rigid-As-Possible” manner, hence the name ARAP. The local structures consist of reference “patches” and reference triangles, both obtained from inter-sensor distances. We elaborate on the relationship between the ARAP algorithm and other state-of-the-art algorithms, and provide experimental results demonstrating that ARAP is significantly less sensitive to sparse connectivity and measurement noise. We also show how ARAP may be distributed.
