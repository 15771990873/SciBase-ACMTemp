This study presents several extensions to our previous work on the PipeProbe system, a mobile sensor system for identifying the spatial topology of hidden water pipelines (i.e., non-moldable pipes such as copper and PVC) behind walls or under floors [Lai et al. 2010]. The PipeProbe system works by dropping a tiny wireless sensor capsule into the source of a water pipeline. As the PipeProbe capsule traverses the pipelines, it gathers and transmits pressure and angular velocity readings. Through spatiotemporal analysis of these sensor readings, the proposed algorithm locates all turning points in the pipelines and maps their 3D spatial topology. This study expands upon previous research by developing new sensing techniques that identify variable-diameter pipes and differentiate 90-degree pipe turns from 45-degree pipe bends.
