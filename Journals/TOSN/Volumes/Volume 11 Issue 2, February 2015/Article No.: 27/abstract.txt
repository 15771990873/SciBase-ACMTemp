The data collected by sensor nodes over a geographical region is contaminated with Gaussian and impulsive noise. The conventional gradient-based distributed adaptive estimation algorithms exhibit good performance in the presence of Gaussian noise but perform poorly in impulsive noise environments. Therefore, the objective of this article is to propose a robust distributed adaptive algorithm that alleviates the effect of impulsive noise. An error saturation nonlinearity-based robust distributed strategy is proposed in an incremental cooperative network to estimate the desired parameters in impulsive noise. The steady-state analysis of the proposed error saturation nonlinearity incremental least mean squares (SNILMS) algorithm is carried out by employing the spatial-temporal energy conservation principle. Both theoretical and simulation results show that the presence of the error nonlinearity has made the proposed SNILMS algorithm robust to impulsive noise.
