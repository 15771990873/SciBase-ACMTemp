We present a framework for analyzing the effects of random and selective compromises (using order statistics) in sensor networks. We discuss the problem of ensuring data integrity at the source and during transit in sensor networks, and present an analysis of the reliability of reports from mobile collectors. No analysis has appeared in the literature of source integrity for mobile nodes, or of selective attacks in sensor networks. We address transit data integrity by presenting mGKE, a key establishment scheme for general group-based sensor deployments, and present a detailed analytical and experimental comparison of mGKE with current schemes. mGKE outperforms current methods in terms of resilience, connectivity, and memory and communication overhead.
