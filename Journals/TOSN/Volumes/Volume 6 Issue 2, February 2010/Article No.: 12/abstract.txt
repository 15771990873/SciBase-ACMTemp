Link asymmetry is one of the unique challenges that wireless sensor networks pose in the design of network protocols. We observe, based on testbed experiments, that a substantial percentage of links are asymmetric, many are even unidirectional. We also find that the reliability of synchronous acknowledgments is considerably higher than that of asynchronous messages. Thus the norm of estimating link quality bidirectionally via asynchronous beacons underestimates the link reliability of asymmetric links. This leads us to investigate how to exploit asymmetric links in order to improve network functions such as convergecast routing in sensor networks via one-way link estimation. We propose a new one-way link metric ETF (for theexpected number of transmissions over forward links) and present a local procedure for its estimation. We use ETF to identify reliable forward links, and we use dynamic retransmission thresholding for error control. Via experiments on testbeds of CC1000 radios and CC2420 radios (an IEEE 802.15.4-compliant radio), we quantify the performance improvement in ETF as compared with ETX. We also study the performance improvement of ETF over ETX when no special mechanism is employed to discover asymmetric links or to control retransmissions.
