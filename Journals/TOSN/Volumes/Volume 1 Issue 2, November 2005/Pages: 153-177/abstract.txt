An ad-hoc wireless sensor network-based system is presented that detects and accurately locates shooters even in urban environments. The localization accuracy of the system in open terrain is competitive with that of existing centralized countersniper systems. However, the presented sensor network-based solution surpasses the traditional approach because it can mitigate acoustic multipath effects prevalent in urban areas and it can also resolve multiple simultaneous shots. These unique characteristics of the system are made possible by employing novel sensor fusion techniques that utilize the spatial and temporal diversity of multiple detections. In this article, in addition to the overall system architecture, the middleware services and the unique sensor fusion algorithms are described. An analysis of the experimental data gathered during field trials at US military facilities is also presented.
