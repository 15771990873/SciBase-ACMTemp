This article considers the problem of distributing sensors to observe a random field while meeting a series of energy and coverage constraints. In the network under consideration,Nidentical sensors are to be distributed, with each sensor sending data to a single fusion center at a fixed rate Î”R. The problem of sensor allocation to the coverage area is reduced to the problem of allocating sensors to cells by first partitioning the coverage field into cells, and then assuming that sensors in the same cells make the same observations. It is shown that the resulting sensor allocation problem is equivalent to a discrete form of the rate allocation problem, a well-known problem in the field of information theory. General guidelines for solving this problem are provided.
