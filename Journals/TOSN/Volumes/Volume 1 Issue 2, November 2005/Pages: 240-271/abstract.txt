This article presents FAR, a Face-Aware Routing protocol for mobicast---a spatiotemporal variant of multicast tailored for sensor networks with environmental mobility. FAR features face-routing and timed-forwarding for delivering a message to a mobile delivery zone. Both analytical and statistical results show that FAR achieves reliable spatial and just-in-time message delivery with only moderate communication and memory overhead. This article also presents a novel distributed algorithm for spatial neighborhood discovery for FAR bootstrapping. The spatiotemporal performance and reliability of FAR are demonstrated via network simulations.
