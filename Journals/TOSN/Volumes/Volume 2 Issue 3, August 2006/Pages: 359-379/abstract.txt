In this article we propose a set of necessary and sufficient conditions under which the long-term averaged throughput in an ad hoc network can remain constant as the number of nodesnincreases.Throughputrefers to the minimum achievable rate between a source-destination pair for a given routing mechanism and physical model, when the network is shared by Î˜(n) randomly chosen source-destination pairs. The main idea is to use aconnectivity graph, which does not represent the actual physical network but rather the available communication resources. This graph also allows one to translate the problem of maximizing the throughput in ad hoc networks to the multicommodity flow problem and directly apply related results.
