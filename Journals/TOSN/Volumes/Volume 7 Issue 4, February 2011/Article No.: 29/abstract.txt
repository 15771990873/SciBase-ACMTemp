A formal treatment to the security of Concealed Data Aggregation (CDA) and the more general Private Data Aggregation (PDA) is given. While there exist a handful of constructions, rigorous security models and analyses for CDA or PDA are still lacking. Standard security notions for public key encryption, including semantic security and indistinguishability against chosen ciphertext attacks, are refined to cover the multisender nature and aggregation functionality of CDA and PDA in the security model. The proposed security model is sufficiently general to cover most application scenarios and constructions of privacy-preserving data aggregation. An impossibility result on achieving security against adaptive chosen ciphertext attacks in CDA/PDA is shown. A generic CDA construction based on public key homomorphic encryption is given, along with a proof of its security in the proposed model. The security of a number of existing schemes is analyzed in the proposed model.
