Sensor networks have a significant potential in diverse applications some of which are already beginning to be deployed in areas such as environmental monitoring. As the application logic becomes more complex, programming difficulties are becoming a barrier to adoption of these networks. The difficulty in programming sensor networks is not only due to their inherently distributed nature but also the need for mechanisms to address their harsh operating conditions such as unreliable communications, faulty nodes, and extremely constrained resources. Researchers have proposed different programming models to overcome these difficulties with the ultimate goal of making programming easy while making full use of available resources. In this article, we first explore the requirements for programming models for sensor networks. Then we present a taxonomy of the programming models, classified according to the level of abstractions they provide. We present an evaluation of various programming models for their responsiveness to the requirements. Our results point to promising efforts in the area and a discussion of the future directions of research in this area.
