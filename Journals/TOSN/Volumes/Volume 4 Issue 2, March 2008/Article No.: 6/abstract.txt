Networking protocols for multihop wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are required to simultaneously minimize resource usage as well as optimize performance metrics such as latency and reliability. This article explores the energy-latency-reliability tradeoff for broadcast in WSNs by presenting a new protocol calledPBBF. Essentially, for a given reliability level, energy and latency are found to be inversely related and our study quantifies this relationship at the reliability boundary. Therefore, PBBF offers an application designer considerable flexibility in the choice of desired operation points. Furthermore, we propose an extension to dynamically adjust the PBBF parameters to minimize the input required from the designer.
