We propose a low-overhead scheme for detecting a network partition or cut in a sensor network. Consider a networkSofnsensors, modeled as points in a two-dimensional plane. An &epsiv;-cut, for any 0 < &epsiv; < 1, is a linear separation of &epsiv;nnodes inSfrom a distinguished node, thebase station. Our main result is that, by monitoring the status of justO(1/&epsiv;) nodes in the network, the base station can detect whenever an &epsiv;-cutoccurs. Furthermore, this detection comes with a deterministic guarantee that every reported cut has size at least &epsiv;n/2. Besides this combinatorial result, we also propose efficient algorithms for finding theO(1/&epsiv;) nodes that should act assentinels, and report on our simulation results, comparing the sentinel algorithm with two natural schemes based on random sampling.
