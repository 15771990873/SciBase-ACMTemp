With a system ofparallel coordinates, objects inRNcan be represented with planar “graphs” (i.e., planar diagrams) for arbitraryN[21]. InR2, embedded in the projective plane, parallel coordinates induce a point ← → line duality. This yields a new duality betweenbounded and unbounded convex sets and hstars(a generalization of hyperbolas), as well as a duality between convex union (convex merge) and intersection. From these results, algorithms for constructing the intersection and convex merge of convex polygons inO(n) time and the convex hull on the plane inO(logn) for real-time andO(nlogn) worst-case construction, wherenis the total number of points, are derived. By virtue of the duality, these algorithms also apply to polygons whose edges are a certain class of convex curves. These planar constructions are studied prior to exploring generalizations toN-dimensions. The needed results on parallel coordinates are given first.
