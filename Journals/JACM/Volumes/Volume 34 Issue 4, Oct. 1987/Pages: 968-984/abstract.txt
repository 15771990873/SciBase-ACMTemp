An algorithm is presented to compute the residue of a polynomial over a finite field of degreenmodulo a polynomial of degreeO(logn) inO(n) algebraic operations. This algorithm can be implemented on a Turing machine. The implementation is based onTuring machineprocedure that divides a polynomial of degreenby a sparse polynomial withknonzero coefficients inO(kn) steps. This algorithm can be adapted to compute the residue of a number of lengthnmodulo a number of lengthO(logn) inO(n) bit operations.
