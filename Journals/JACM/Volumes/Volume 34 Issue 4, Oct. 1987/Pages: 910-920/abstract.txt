Byzantine Generals protocols enable processes to broadcast messages reliably in the presence of faulty processes. These protocols are run in a system that consists ofnprocesses,tof which are faulty. The protocols are conducted in synchronous rounds of message exchange. It is shown that, in the absence of eavesdropping, without using cryptography, for any &egr; > 0 andt=n/(3 + &egr;), there is a randomized protocol withO(logn) expected number of rounds. If cryptographic methods are allowed, then, for &egr; > 0 andt=n/(2 + &egr;), there is a randomized protocol withO(logn) expected number of rounds. This is an improvement on the lower bound oft+ 1 rounds required for deterministic protocols, and on a previous result oft/lognexpected number of rounds for randomized noncryptographic protocols.
