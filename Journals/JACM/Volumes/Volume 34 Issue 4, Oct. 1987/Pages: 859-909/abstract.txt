Weighted voting is used as the basis for a replication technique for directories. This technique affords arbitrarily high data availability as well as high concurrency. Efficient algorithms are presented for all of the standard directory operations. A structural property of the replicated directory that permits the construction of an efficient algorithm for deletion is proven. Simulation results are presented and the system is modeled and analyzed. The analysis agrees well with the simulation, and the space and time performance are shown to be good for all configurations of the system.
