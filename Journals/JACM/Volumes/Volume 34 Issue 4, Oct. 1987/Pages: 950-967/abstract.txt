Algorithms are given that compute maximum flows in planar directed networks either inO((logn)3) parallel time usingO(n4) processors orO((logn)2) parallel time usingO(n6) processors. The resource consumption of these algorithms is dominated by the cost of finding the value of a maximum flow. When such a value is given, or when the computation is on an undirected network, the bound isO((logn)2) time usingO(n3) processors. No efficient parallel algorithm is known for the maximum flow problem in general networks.
