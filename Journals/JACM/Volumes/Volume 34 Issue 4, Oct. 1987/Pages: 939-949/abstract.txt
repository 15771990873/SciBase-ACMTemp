A new summation formula based on the orthogonal property of Walsh functions is devised. Using this formula, thek-dimensional discrepancy of the generalized feedback shift register (GFSR) pseudorandom numbers is derived. The relation between the discrepancy andk-distribution of GFSR sequences is also obtained. Finally the definition of optimal GPSR pseudorandom number generators is introduced.
