It is assumed that long wires represent large capacitive loads, and the effect on the area of a VLSI layout when drivers are introduced along many long wires in the layout is investigated. A layout is presented for which the introduction ofstandarddrivers along long wires squares the area of the layout; it is shown, however, that the increase in area is never greater than the layout's area squared if the driver can be laid out in a square region. This paper also shows an area-time trade-off for the driver of a single long wire of length / by which the area of the driver from &THgr;(l), to &THgr;(lq),q< l, can be reduced if a delay of &THgr;(ll-q) rather than &THgr;(logl) can be tolerated. Tight bounds are also obtained on the worst-case area increase in general layouts having these drivers.
