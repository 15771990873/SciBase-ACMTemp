The generalized feedback shift register pseudorandom number generators proposed by Lewis and Payne provide a very attractive method of random number generation. Unfortunately, the published initialization procedure can be extremely time consuming. This paper considers an alternative method of initialization based on a natural polynomial representation for the terms of a feedback shift register sequence that results in substantial improvements in the initialization process.
