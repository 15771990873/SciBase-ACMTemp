The accessibility problem for linear sequential machines [12] is the problem of deciding whether there is an inputxsuch that onxthe machine starting in a given stateq1goes to a given stateq2. Harrison shows that this problem is reducible to the following simply stated linear algebra problem, which we call the "orbit problem":Given (n, A, x, y), wherenis a natural number andA, x,andyarenxn,nx1, andnx1 matrices of rationals, respectively, decide whether there is a natural numberIsuch thatAix=y.He conjectured that the orbit problem is decidable. No progress was made on the conjecture for ten years until Shank [22] showed that ifnis fixed at 2, then the problem is decidable. This paper shows that the orbit problem for generalnis decidable and indeed decidable in polynomial time. The orbit problem arises in several contexts; two of these, linear recurrences and the discrete logarithm problem for polynomials, are discussed, and we apply our algorithm for the orbit problem in these contexts.
