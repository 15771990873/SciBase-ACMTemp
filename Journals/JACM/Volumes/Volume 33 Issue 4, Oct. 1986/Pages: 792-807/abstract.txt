A constructive theory of randomness for functions, based on computational complexity, is developed, and a pseudorandom function generator is presented. This generator is a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm that transforms pairs (g,r), wheregisanyone-way function andris a randomk-bit string, to polynomial-time computable functions ƒr: {1, … , 2k} → {1, … , 2k}. These ƒr's cannot be distinguished fromrandomfunctions by any probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm that asks and receives the value of a function at arguments of its choice. The result has applications in cryptography, random constructions, and complexity theory.
