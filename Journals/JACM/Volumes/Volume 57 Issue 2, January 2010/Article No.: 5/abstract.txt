We present a general approach for designing approximation algorithms for a fundamental class of geometric clustering problems in arbitrary dimensions. More specifically, our approach leads to simple randomized algorithms for thek-means,k-median and discretek-means problems that yield (1+&epsiv;) approximations with probability â‰¥ 1/2 and running times ofO(2(k/&epsiv;)O(1)dn). These are the first algorithms for these problems whose running times are linear in the size of the input (ndfornpoints inddimensions) assumingkand &epsiv; are fixed. Our method is general enough to be applicable to clustering problems satisfying certain simple properties and is likely to have further applications.
