In theMinimum Bounded Degree Spanning Treeproblem, we are given an undirected graphG= (V, E) with a degree upper boundBvon each vertexv∈V, and the task is to find a spanning tree of minimum cost that satisfies all the degree bounds. LetOPTbe the cost of an optimal solution to this problem. In this article we present a polynomial-time algorithm which returns a spanning treeTof cost at mostOPTanddT(v) ≤Bv+ 1 for allv, wheredT(v) denotes the degree ofvinT. This generalizes a result of Fürer and Raghavachari [1994] to weighted graphs, and settles a conjecture of Goemans [2006] affirmatively. The algorithm generalizes when each vertexvhas a degree lower boundAvand a degree upper boundBv, and returns a spanning tree with cost at mostOPTandAv- 1 ≤dT(v) ≤Bv+ 1 for allv∈V. This is essentially the best possible. The main technique used is an extension of the iterative rounding method introduced by Jain [2001] for the design of approximation algorithms.
