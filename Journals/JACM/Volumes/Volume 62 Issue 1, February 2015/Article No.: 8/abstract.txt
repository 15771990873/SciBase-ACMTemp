In this article, we disprove a conjecture of Goemans and Linial; namely, that every negative type metric embeds into &ell;1with constant distortion. We show that for an arbitrarily small constant δ > 0, for all large enoughn, there is ann-point negative type metric which requires distortion at least (log logn)1/6-δto embed into &ell;1. Surprisingly, our construction is inspired by the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC), establishing a previously unsuspected connection between probabilistically checkable proof systems (PCPs) and the theory of metric embeddings. We first prove that the UGC implies a super-constant hardness result for the (nonuniform) SPARSESTCUTproblem. Though this hardness result relies on the UGC, we demonstrate, nevertheless, that the corresponding PCP reduction can be used to construct an “integrality gap instance” for SPARSESTCUT. Towards this, we first construct an integrality gap instance for a natural SDP relaxation of UNIQUEGAMES. Then we “simulate” the PCP reduction and “translate” the integrality gap instance of UNIQUEGAMESto an integrality gap instance of SPARSESTCUT. This enables us to prove a (log logn)1/6-δintegrality gap for SPARSESTCUT, which is known to be equivalent to the metric embedding lower bound.
