A finite-state Markov chainMcan be regarded as a linear transform operating on the set of probability distributions over its node set. The iterative applications ofMto an initial probability distribution μ0will generate a trajectory of probability distributions. Thus, a set of initial distributions will induce a set of trajectories. It is an interesting and useful task to analyze the dynamics ofMas defined by this set of trajectories. The novel idea here is to carry out this task in asymbolicframework. Specifically, we discretize the probability value space [0,1] into a finite set of intervalsI= {I1,I2,...,Im}. A concrete probability distribution μ over the node set {1, 2,...,n} ofMis then symbolically represented asD, a tuple of intervals drawn fromIwhere theith component ofDwill be the interval in which μ(i) falls. The set of discretized distributionsDis a finite alphabet. Hence, the trajectory, generated by repeated applications ofMto an initial distribution, will induce an infinite string over this alphabet. Given a set of initial distributions, the symbolic dynamics ofMwill then consist of a language of infinite stringsLover the alphabetD.Our main goal is to verify whetherLmeets a specification given as a linear-time temporal logic formula &phiv;. In our logic, an atomic proposition will assert that the current probability of a node falls in the intervalIfromI. IfLis an ω-regular language, one can hope to solve our model-checking problem (whetherL&models; &phiv;&quest;) using standard techniques. However, we show that, in general, this is not the case. Consequently, we develop the notion of an &epsi;-approximation, based on the transient and long-term behaviors of the Markov chainM. Briefly, the symbolic trajectory ξ' is an &epsi;-approximation of the symbolic trajectory ξ iff (1) ξ' agrees with ξ during its transient phase; and (2) both ξ and ξ' are within an &epsi;-neighborhood at all times after the transient phase. Our main results are that one can effectively check whether (i) for each infinite word inL, at least one of its &epsi;-approximations satisfies the given specification; (ii) for each infinite word inL, all its &epsi;-approximations satisfy the specification. These verification results are strong in that they apply to all finite state Markov chains.
