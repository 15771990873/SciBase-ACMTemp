An algorithm (FLOW) for finding the shortest distance from a given nodeSto each nodeXof a directed graph with nonnegative integer arc lengths less than or equal toWMis presented.FLOWis compared with its best-known competitor, that of Dijkstra and Yen (DFLO). The new algorithm is shown to execute in time of order max (V, E, D), whereDis the maximum distance computed in a graph withEedges andVnodes. By counting the number of operands fetched during execution ofFLOWandDFLO, an estimate of the running time of each is obtained. This estimate shows thatFLOWshould execute faster thanDFLOwhenE/V2=&agr;< .2875, andVâ‰¥ 22WM/&bgr;+ 5/&bgr;+ 7.04, where&bgr;= 23 - 80&agr;.FLOWalso will solve the all-pairs shortest distance problem, requiring timeO(V* max(V, E, D)) for the solution.
