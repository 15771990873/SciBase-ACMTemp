A new algorithm for global flow analysis on reducible graphs is presented. The algorithm is shown to treat a very general class of function spaces. For a graph ofeedges, the algorithm has a worst-case time bound ofO(eloge) function operations. It is also shown that in programming terms, the number of operations is proportional toeplus the number of exits from program loops. Consequently a restriction to one-entry one-exit control structures guarantees linearity. The algorithm can be extended to yet larger classes of function spaces and graphs by relaxing the time bound. Examples are given of code improvement problems which can be solved using the algorithm.
