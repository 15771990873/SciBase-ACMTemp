The general knapsack problem is known to be NP-complete. In this paper a very special knapsack problem ia studied, namely, one with only two variables. A polynomial-time algorithm is presented and analyzed. However, it remains an open problem that for any fixedn> 2, the knapsack problem withnvariables can be solved in polynomial time.
