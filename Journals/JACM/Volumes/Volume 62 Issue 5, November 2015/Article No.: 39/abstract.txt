This article shows a general result about finite monoids and weight reducing string rewriting systems. As a consequence it proves a long standing conjecture in formal language theory: All regular languages are Church-Rosser congruential. The class of Church-Rosser congruential languages was introduced by McNaughton, Narendran, and Otto in 1988. A languageLis Church-Rosser congruential if there exists a finite, confluent, and length-reducing semi-Thue systemSsuch thatLis a finite union of congruence classes moduloS. It was known that there are deterministic linear context-free languages which are not Church-Rosser congruential, but the conjecture was that all regular languages are of this form. The article offers a stronger statement: A language is regular if and only if it is strongly Church-Rosser congruential. It is the journal version of the conference abstract which was presented at ICALP 2012.
