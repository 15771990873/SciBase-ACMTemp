We give the first polylogarithmic-competitive randomized online algorithm for thek-server problem on an arbitrary finite metric space. In particular, our algorithm achieves a competitive ratio of Ã•(log3nlog2k) for any metric space onnpoints. Our algorithm improves upon the deterministic (2k-1)-competitive algorithm of Koutsoupias and Papadimitriou [Koutsoupias and Papadimitriou 1995] for a wide range ofn.
