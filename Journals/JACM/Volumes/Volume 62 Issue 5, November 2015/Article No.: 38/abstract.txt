We present distributed network algorithms to compute weighted and unweighted matchings with improved approximation ratios and running times. The computational model is a network of processors exchangingO(logn)-bit messages (the CONGEST model). For unweighted graphs, we give an algorithm providing (1-&epsi;)-approximation inO(logn) time for any constant &epsi;>0, improving on the classical ½-approximation inOlogn) time of Israeli and Itai [1986]. The time complexity of the algorithm depends on 1&hybull;&epsi; exponentially in the general case, and polynomially in bipartite graphs. For weighted graphs, we present another algorithm which provides (½-&epsi;) approximation in general graphs inO(log&epsi;-1logn) time, improving on the previously known algorithms which attain (¼-&epsi;)-approximation inO(logn) time or ½-approximation inO(n) time. All our algorithms are randomized: the complexity bounds hold both with high probability and for the expected running time.
