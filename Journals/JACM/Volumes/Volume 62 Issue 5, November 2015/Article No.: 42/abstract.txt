Subexponential time approximation algorithms are presented for the UniqueGamesand Small-SetExpansionproblems. Specifically, for some absolute constantc, the following two algorithms are presented.(1) An exp(kn&epsi;)-time algorithm that, given as input ak-alphabet unique game onnvariables that has an assignment satisfying 1-&epsi;cfraction of its constraints, outputs an assignment satisfying 1-&epsi; fraction of the constraints.(2) An exp(n&epsi;/δ)-time algorithm that, given as input ann-vertex regular graph that has a setSof δnvertices with edge expansion at most&epsi;c, outputs a setS'of at most δnvertices with edge expansion at most &epsi;.subexponential algorithm is also presented with improved approximation to MaxCut, SparsestCut, and VertexCoveron some interesting subclasses of instances. These instances are graphs with lowthreshold rank, an interesting new graph parameter highlighted by this work.Khot's Unique Games Conjecture (UGC) states that it isNP-hard to achieve approximation guarantees such as ours for UniqueGames. While the results here stop short of refuting the UGC, they do suggest that UniqueGamesare significantly easier thanNP-hard problems such as Max3-Sat, Max3-Lin, LabelCover, and more, which are believed not to have a subexponential algorithm achieving a nontrivial approximation ratio.Of special interest in these algorithms is a new notion of graph decomposition that may have other applications. Namely, it is shown for every &epsi; >0 and every regularn-vertex graphG, by changing at most δ fraction ofG's edges, one can breakGinto disjoint parts so that the stochastic adjacency matrix of the induced graph on each part has at mostn&epsi;eigenvalues larger than 1-η, where η depends polynomially on &epsi;. The subexponential algorithm combines this decomposition with previous algorithms for UniqueGameson graphs with few large eigenvalues [Kolla and Tulsiani 2007; Kolla 2010].
