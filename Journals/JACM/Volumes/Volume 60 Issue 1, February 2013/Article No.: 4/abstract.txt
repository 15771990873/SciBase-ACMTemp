Given samples from two distributions over ann-element set, we wish to test whether these distributions are statistically close. We present an algorithm which uses sublinear inn, specifically,O(n2/3ε−8/3logn), independent samples from each distribution, runs in time linear in the sample size, makes no assumptions about the structure of the distributions, and distinguishes the cases when the distance between the distributions is small (less than {ε4/3n−1/3/32,εn−1/2/4}) or large (more thanε) in &ell;1distance. This result can be compared to the lower bound ofΩ(n2/3ε−2/3) for this problem given by Valiant [2008].Our algorithm has applications to the problem of testing whether a given Markov process is rapidly mixing. We present sublinear algorithms for several variants of this problem as well.
