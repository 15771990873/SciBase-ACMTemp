LetM(m,n)be the minimum number of comparatorsneeded in a comparator network that mergesmelementsx1≤x2≤&cdots;≤xmandnelementsy1≤y2≤&cdots;≤yn, wheren≥m. Batcher's odd-even merge yields the following upper bound:Mm,n≤12m+nlog2m+on;in particular,Mn,n≤nlog2n+On.We prove the following lower bound that matches the upper bound above asymptotically asn≥m→∞:Mm,n≥12m+nlog2m-Om;in particular,Mn,n≥nlog2n-On.Our proof technique extends to give similarily tight lower bounds for the size of monotone Boolean circuits for merging, and for the size of switching networks capable of realizing the set of permutations that arise from merging.
