The nature of programming languages that fail to have a relatively complete proof formalism is discussed. First, it is shown that such failures may be due to the meagerness of the programming language, rather than to the presence of complex control structures as in the cases studied so far. The failure of relative completeness is then derived for two languages with a rich control structure, using simple simulations of general recursive functions by procedure call mechanisms.
