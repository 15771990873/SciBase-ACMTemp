For every choice of positive integerscandksuch thatk≥ 3 andc2-k≥ 0.7, there is a positive number &egr; such that, with probability tending to 1 asntends to ∞, a randomly chosen family ofcnclauses of sizekovernvariables is unsatisfiable, but every resolution proof of its unsatisfiability must generate at least (1 + &egr;)nclauses.
