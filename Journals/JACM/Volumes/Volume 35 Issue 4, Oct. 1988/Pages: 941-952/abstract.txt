Recently a new connection was discovered between the parallel complexity classNC1and the theory of finite automata in the work of Barrington on bounded width branching programs. There (nonuniform)NC1was characterized as those languages recognized by a certain nonuniform version of a DFA. Here we extend this characterization to show that the internal structures ofNC1and the class of automata are closely related.In particular, using Th√©rien's classification of finite monoids, we give new characterizations of the classesAC0, depth-kAC0, andACC, the last being theAC0closure of the modqfunctions for all constantq. We settle some of the open questions in [3], give a new proof that the dot-depth hierarchy of algebraic automata theory is infinite [8], and offer a new framework for understanding the internal structure ofNC1.
