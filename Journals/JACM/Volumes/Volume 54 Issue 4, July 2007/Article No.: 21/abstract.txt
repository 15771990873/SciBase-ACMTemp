We study random submatrices of a large matrixA. We show how to approximately computeAfrom its random submatrix of the smallest possible sizeO(rlogr) with a small error in the spectral norm, wherer&equals; &Verbar;A&Verbar;2F/&Verbar;A&Verbar;22is the numerical rank ofA. The numerical rank is always bounded by, and is a stable relaxation of, the rank ofA. This yields an asymptotically optimal guarantee in an algorithm for computinglow-rank approximationsofA. We also prove asymptotically optimal estimates on thespectral normand thecut-normof random submatrices ofA. The result for the cut-norm yields a slight improvement on the best-known sample complexity for an approximation algorithm for MAX-2CSP problems. We use methods of Probability in Banach spaces, in particular the law of large numbers for operator-valued random variables.
