The relationship between the length of a word and the maximum length of its unbordered factors is investigated in this article. Consider a finite wordwof lengthn. We call a wordborderedif it has a proper prefix, which is also a suffix of that word. Let μ(w) denote the maximum length of all unbordered factors ofw, and let ∂(w) denote the period ofw. Clearly, μ(w) ≤ ∂(w).We establish that μ(w) &equals; ∂(w), ifwhas an unbordered prefix of length μ(w) andn≥ 2μ(w) − 1. This bound is tight and solves the stronger version of an old conjecture by Duval [1983]. It follows from this result that, in general,n≥ 3μ(w) − 3 implies μ(w) &equals; ∂(w), which gives an improved bound for the question raised by Ehrenfeucht and Silberger in 1979.
