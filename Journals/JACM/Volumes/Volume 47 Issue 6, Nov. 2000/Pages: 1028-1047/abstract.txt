A deterministic algorithm for computing a minimum spanning tree of a connected graph is presented. Its running time is0(m&agr;(m, n)), where  &agr; is the classical functional inverse of Ackermann's function andn(respectively,m) is the number of vertices (respectively, edges). The algorithm is comparison-based : it uses pointers, not arrays, and it makes no numeric assumptions on the edge costs.
