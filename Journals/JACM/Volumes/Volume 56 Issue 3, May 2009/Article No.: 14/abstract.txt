We prove that Bimatrix, the problem of finding a Nash equilibrium in a two-player game, is complete for the complexity classPPAD(Polynomial Parity Argument, Directed version) introduced by Papadimitriou in 1991.Our result, building upon the work of Daskalakis et al. [2006a] on the complexity of four-player Nash equilibria, settles a long standing open problem in algorithmic game theory. It also serves as a starting point for a series of results concerning the complexity of two-player Nash equilibria. In particular, we prove the following theorems:—Bimatrix does not have a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme unless every problem inPPADis solvable in polynomial time.—The smoothed complexity of the classic Lemke-Howson algorithm and, in fact, of any algorithm for Bimatrix is not polynomial unless every problem inPPADis solvable in randomized polynomial time.Our results also have a complexity implication in mathematical economics:—Arrow-Debreu market equilibria arePPAD-hard to compute.
