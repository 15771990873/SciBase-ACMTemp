The Minimum Weight Triangulation problem is to find a triangulationT&ast;of minimum length for a given set of pointsPin the Euclidean plane. It was one of the few longstanding open problems from the famous list of twelve problems with unknown complexity status, published by Garey and Johnson [1979]. Very recently, the problem was shown to beNP-hard by Mulzer and Rote [2006]. In this article, we present a quasi-polynomial time approximation scheme for Minimum Weight Triangulation.
