Recurrent neural networks that aretrainedto behave like deterministic finite-state automata (DFAs) can show deteriorating performance when tested on long strings. This deteriorating performance can be attributed to the instability of the internal representation of the learned DFA states. The use of a sigmoidel discriminant function together with the recurrent structure contribute to this instability. We prove that a simple algorithm canconstructsecond-order recurrent neural networks with a sparse interconnection topology and sigmoidal discriminant function such that the internal DFA state representations are stable, that is, the constructed network correctly classifies strings ofarbitrary length. The algorithm is based on encoding strengths of weights directly into the neural network. We derive a relationship between the weight strength and the number of DFA states for robust string classification. For a DFA withnstate andminput alphabet symbols, the constructive algorithm generates a “programmed” neural network withO(n) neurons andO(mn) weights. We compare our algorithm to other methods proposed in the literature.
