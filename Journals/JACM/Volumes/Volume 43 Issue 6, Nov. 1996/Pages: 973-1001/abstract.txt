This paper studies the problem of dedicating routes to connections in optical networks. In optical networks, the vast bandwidth available in an optical fiber is utilized by partitioning it into several channels, each at a different optical wavelength. A connection between two nodes is assigned a specific wavelength, with the constraint that no two connections sharing a link in the network can be assigned the same wavelength. This paper considers optical networks with and without switches, and different types of routing in these networks. It presents optimal or near-optimal constructions of optical networks in these cases and algorithms for routing connections, specifically permutation routing for the networks constructed here.
