This paper gives an algorithm for solving linear programming problems. For a problem with n constraints and d variables, the algorithm requires an expectedOd2n+lognOdd/2+O1+Od4nlognarithmetic operations, asn→∞. The constant factors do not depend on d. Also, an algorithm is given for integer linear programming. Let4bound the number of bits required to specify the rational numbers defining an input constraint or the objective function vector. Let n and d be as before. Then, the algorithm requires expectedO2ddn+8ddnl nnlnn+dod4lnnoperations on numbers withdo14bits, asn→∞, where the constant factors do not depend on d or4to other convex programming problems. For example, an algorithm for finding the smallest sphere enclosing a set of n points inEdhas the same time bound.
