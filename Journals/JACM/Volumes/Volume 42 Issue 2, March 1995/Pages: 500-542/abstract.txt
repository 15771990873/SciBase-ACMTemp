This paper presents algorithms for routing channels withLâ‰¥2 layers. For the unit vertical overlap model, we describe a two-layer channel routing algorithm that uses at mostd+Odtracks to route two-terminal net problems and2d+odtracks to route multiterminal nets. We also show thatd+Wlog dtracks are required to route two-terminal net problems in the worst case even if arbitrary vertical overlap is allowed. We generalize the algorithm to unrestricted multilayer routing and use onlyd/L-1+Od/L+1tracks for two-terminal net problems (withinwithin Od/L+ 1tracks of optimaland d/L-2+Od/L+1tracks for multiterminal net problemswithin a factor ofL-1/L-2times optimal. We demonstrate the generality of our routing strategy by showing that it can be used to duplicate some of the best previous upper bounds for other models (two-layer Manhattan routing and two and three-layer knock-knee routing of two-terminal, two-sided nets), and gives a new upper bound for rotuing with 45-degree diagonal wires.
