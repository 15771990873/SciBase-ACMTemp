We study the problem of “privacy amplification”: key agreement between two parties who both know a weak secretw, such as a password. (Such a setting is ubiquitous on the internet, where passwords are the most commonly used security device.) We assume that the key agreement protocol is taking place in the presence of an active computationally unbounded adversary Eve. The adversary may have partial knowledge aboutw, so we assume only thatwhas some entropy from Eve’s point of view. Thus, the goal of the protocol is to convert this nonuniform secretwinto a uniformly distributed stringRthat is fully secret from Eve.Rmay then be used as a key for running symmetric cryptographic protocols (such as encryption, authentication, etc.).Because we make no computational assumptions, the entropy inRcan come only fromw. Thus, such a protocol must minimize the entropy loss during its execution, so thatRis as long as possible. The best previous results have entropy loss of Θ(κ2), whereκis the security parameter, thus requiring the password to be very long even for small values ofκ. In this work, we present the first protocol for information-theoretic key agreement that has entropy loss linear in the security parameter. The result is optimal up to constant factors. We achieve our improvement through a somewhat surprising application of error-correcting codes for the edit distance.The protocol can be extended to provide also “information reconciliation,” that is, to work even when the two parties have slightly different versions ofw(e.g., when biometrics are involved).
