We consider a modified notion of planarity, in which two nations of a map are considered adjacent when they share anypointof their boundaries (not necessarily anedge, as planarity requires). Such adjacencies define amap graph. We give an NP characterization for such graphs, derive some consequences regarding sparsity and coloring, and survey some algorithmic results.
