The problem of finding a center string that is "close" to every
given string arises in computational molecular biology and coding
theory. This problem has two versions: the Closest String problem
and the Closest Substring problem. Given a set of stringsS= {s1,s2, ...,sn}, each of lengthm, the Closest String
problem is to find the smallestdand a string s of lengthmwhich is within Hamming distance d to eachsiεS. This problem comes from
coding theory when we are looking for a code not too far away from
a given set of codes. Closest Substring problem, with an additional
input integerL, asks for the smallest d and a strings, of lengthL, which is within Hamming distance d
away from a substring, of lengthL, of each si. This problem
is much more elusive than the Closest String problem. The Closest
Substring problem is formulated from applications in finding
conserved regions, identifying genetic drug targets and generating
genetic probes in molecular biology. Whether there are efficient
approximation algorithms for both problems are major open questions
in this area. We present two polynomial-time approximation
algorithms with approximation ratio 1 + ε for any small
ε to settle both questions.
