Branch-and-bound implicit enumeration algorithms for permutation problems (discrete optimization problems where the set of feasible solutions is the permutation groupSn) are characterized in terms of a sextuple (BpS,E,D,L,U), where (1)Bpis the branching rule for permutation problems, (2)Sis the next node selection rule, (3)Eis the set of node elimination rules, (4)Dis the node dominance function, (5)Lis the node lower-bound cost function, and (6)Uis an upper-bound solution cost. A general algorithm based on this characterization is presented and the dependence of the computational requirements on the choice of algorithm parameters,S, E, D, L,andUis investigated theoretically. The results verify some intuitive notions but disprove others.
