Letrbe the total number of cycles required to complete a compromise merge of a given number of initial strings. Define row vectors mr-jand djwhose components represent the number and length respectively of strings at the end of thejth cycle of the merge. It is shown in this paper that there are asymptotic approximations to these vectors, which enables one to compute their respective components directly. Consequently, the number of cyclesrcan be computed directly, as in the case of the balanced merge.
