Efficiently computable a posteriori error bounds are attained by using a posteriori models for bounding roundoff errors in the basic floating-point operations. Forward error bounds are found for inner product and polynomial evaluations. An analysis of the Crout algorithm in solving systems of linear algebraic equations leads to sharper backward a posteriori bounds. The results in the analysis of the iterative refinement give bounds useful in estimating the rate of convergence. Some numerical experiments are included.
