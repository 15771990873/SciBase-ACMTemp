The (vertex) connectivity κ of a graph is the smallest number of vertices whose deletion separates the graph or makes it trivial. We present the fastest known algorithm for finding κ. For a digraph withnvertices,medges and connectivity κ the time bound isO((n&plus; min&lcub;κ&frac52;, κn¾&rcub;)m). This improves the previous best bound ofO((n&plus; min&lcub;κ3, κn&rcub;)m). For an undirected graph both of these bounds hold withmreplaced by κn. Expander graphs are useful for solving the following subproblem that arises in connectivity computation: A known setRof vertices contains two large but unknown subsets that are separated by some unknown setSof κ vertices; we must find two vertices ofRthat are separated byS.
