We show that there is no log&frac13; − &epsiv;Mapproximation for the undirected Edge-Disjoint Paths problem unlessNP⊆ZPTIME(npolylog(n)), whereMis the size of the graph and &epsiv; is any positive constant. This hardness result also applies to the undirected All-or-Nothing Multicommodity Flow problem and the undirected Node-Disjoint Paths problem.
