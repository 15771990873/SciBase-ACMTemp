A solution ofnmatrix equations is formulated by using existing theory of pseudo inverses of matrices. Techniques for solving recursively such systems, techniques for determining the rank of matrices, techniques for testing whether or not a vector is a null vector of a given matrix, and techniques for testing whether or not a constant is an eigenvalue are indicated.
