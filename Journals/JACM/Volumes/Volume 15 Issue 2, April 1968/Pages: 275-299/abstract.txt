It is well known that real variable analysis is nonconstructive. For example, although it is asserted that every bounded monotone sequence converges to a limit, there is no algorithm for obtaining this limit.This paper presents a constructive analysis which is restricted to a countable set of numbers, the field of computable numbers. These numbers are defined in a new way by employing the concept of “programmable functions.” The resultant analysis differs from real analysis in many important respects.
