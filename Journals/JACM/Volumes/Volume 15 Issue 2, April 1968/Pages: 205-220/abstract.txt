This paper describes a mathematical model for the study of contour-line data. Formal definitions are given for the various classes of contour lines found on a contour map. The concept of cliff lines is introduced and the properties of both contour lines and cliff lines are investigated. The objective of the paper is to lay a foundation for the development of algorithms that will facilitate the digital computer solutions of problems involving contour-line data.
