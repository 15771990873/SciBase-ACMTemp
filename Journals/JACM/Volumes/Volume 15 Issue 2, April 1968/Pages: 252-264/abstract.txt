A modified version of the Fast Fourier Transform is developed and described. This version is well adapted for use in a special-purpose computer designed for the purpose. It is shown that only three operators are needed. One operator replaces successive pairs of data points by their sums and differences. The second operator performs a fixed permutation which is an ideal shuffle of the data. The third operator permits the multiplication of a selected subset of the data by a common complex multiplier.If, as seems reasonable, the slowest operation is the complex multiplications required, then, for reasonably sized date sets—e.g. 512 complex numbers—parallelization by the method developed should allow an increase of speed over the serial use of the Fast Fourier Transform by about two orders of magnitude.It is suggested that a machine to realize the speed improvement indicated is quite feasible.The analysis is based on the use of the Kronecker product of matrices. It is suggested that this form is of general use in the development and classification of various modifications and extensions of the algorithm.
