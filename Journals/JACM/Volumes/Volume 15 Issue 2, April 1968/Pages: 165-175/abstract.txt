A formalism for representing sequences or networks of program translations and compiler translations is described. The formalism is shown to be capable of (a) concisely and clearly representing the overall tasks of assemblers and preprocessors, (b) checking for similarities or equivalences among translation networks, and (c) reducing translation networks to smaller entities.
