The concept of a pair algebra is extended so that it can be defined between similar relational systems. It is shown that when the relational systems under consideration are lattices a generalized pair algebra specializes to a pair algebra. Closure properties of generalized pair algebra are investigated and their applications to automata theory are considered.
