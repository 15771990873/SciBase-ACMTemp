This article gives an overview of the geometric complexity theory (GCT) approach towards the P vs. NP and related problems focusing on its main complexity theoretic results. These are: (1) two concrete lower bounds, which are currently the best known lower bounds in the context of the P vs. NC and permanent vs. determinant problems, (2) the Flip Theorem, which formalizes the self-referential paradox in the P vs. NP problem, and (3) the Decomposition Theorem, which decomposes the arithmetic P vs. NP and permanent vs. determinant problems into subproblems without self-referential difficulty, consisting of positivity hypotheses in algebraic geometry and representation theory and easier hardness hypotheses.
