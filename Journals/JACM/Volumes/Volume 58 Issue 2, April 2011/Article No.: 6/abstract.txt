We present several results about Delaunay triangulations (DTs) and convex hulls in transdichotomous and hereditary settings: (i) the DT of a planar point set can be computed in expected timeO(sort(n)) on a word RAM, where sort(n) is the time to sortnnumbers. We assume that the word RAM supports theshuffleoperation in constant time; (ii) if we know the ordering of a planar point set inx- and iny-direction, its DT can be found by a randomized algebraic computation tree of expectedlineardepth; (iii) given a universeUof points in the plane, we construct a data structureDforDelaunay queries: for anyP&subseteq;U,Dcan find the DT ofPin expected timeO(&vert;P&vert; log log &vert;U&vert;); (iv) given a universeUof points in 3-space in general convex position, there is a data structureDforconvex hull queries: for anyP&subseteq;U,Dcan find the convex hull ofPin expected timeO(&vert;P&vert; (log log &vert;U&vert;)2); (v) given a convex polytope in 3-space withnvertices which are colored with Ï‡ &geq; 2 colors, we can split it into the convex hulls of the individual color classes in expected timeO(n(log logn)2).The results (i)--(iii) generalize to higher dimensions, where the expected running time now also depends on the complexity of the resulting DT. We need a wide range of techniques. Most prominently, we describe a reduction from DTs to nearest-neighbor graphs that relies on a new variant of randomized incremental constructions usingdependentsampling.
