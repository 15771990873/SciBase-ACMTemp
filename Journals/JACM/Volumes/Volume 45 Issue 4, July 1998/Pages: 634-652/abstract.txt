Given a collectionFof subsets ofS=
{1,…,n},set
coveris the problem of selecting as few as possible
subsets fromFsuch that their union coversS,, andmax
k-coveris the problem of selectingksubsets fromFsuch that their union has maximum cardinality. Both these problems are
NP-hard.   We prove that (1 -o(1)) lnnis a threshold below  

 which set
cover cannot be approximated efficiently, unless NP has slightly
superpolynomial time algorithms. This closes the gap (up to low-order
terms) between the ratio of approximation achievable by the greedy
alogorithm (which is (1 -o(1)) ln
n), and provious results of Lund and Yanakakis, that showed hardness of
approximation within a ratio oflog2n/2&sime;0.72lnn. For maxk-cover, we show an approximation
threshold of (1 - 1/e)(up to
low-order terms), under assumption thatP≠NP.
