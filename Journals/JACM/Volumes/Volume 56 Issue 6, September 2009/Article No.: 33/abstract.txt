We prove the following information-theoretic property about quantum states.Substate theorem:Let ρ and σ be quantum states in the same Hilbert space with relative entropyS(ρ &par; σ) &colone; Tr ρ (log ρ− log σ) &equals;c. Then for all &epsi; > 0, there is a state ρ′ such that the trace distance &par;ρ′ − ρ&par;tr&colone; Tr &sqrt;(ρ′ − ρ)2≤ &epsi;, and ρ′/2O(c/&epsi;2)≤ σ.It states that if the relative entropy of ρ and σ is small, then there is a state ρ′ close to ρ, i.e. with small trace distance &par;ρ′ − ρ&par;tr, that when scaled down by a factor 2O(c)‘sits inside’, or becomes a ‘substate’ of, σ. This result has several applications in quantum communication complexity and cryptography. Using the substate theorem, we derive a privacy trade-off for theset membership problemin the two-party quantum communication model. Here Alice is given a subsetA&subse; [n], Bob an inputi&in; [n], and they need to determine ifi&in;A.Privacy trade-off for set membership:In any two-party quantum communication protocol for the set membership problem, if Bob reveals onlykbits of information about his input, then Alice must reveal at leastn/2O(k)bits of information about her input.We also discuss relationships between various information theoretic quantities that arise naturally in the context of the substate theorem.
