We show that the sparsest cut in graphs withnvertices andmedges can be approximated withinO(log2n) factor in Õ(m+ n3/2) time using polylogarithmic single commodity max-flow computations. Previous algorithms are based on multicommodity flows that take time Õ(m+ n2). Our algorithm iteratively employs max-flow computations to embed an expander flow, thus providing a certificate of expansion. Our technique can also be extended to yield anO(log2n)-(pseudo-) approximation algorithm for the edge-separator problem with a similar running time.
