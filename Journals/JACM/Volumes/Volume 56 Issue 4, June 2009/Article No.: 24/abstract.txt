Obstruction-freeimplementations of concurrent objects are optimized for the common case where there is nostep contention, and were recently advocated as a solution to the costs associated with synchronization without locks. In this article, we study this claim and this goes through precisely defining the notions of obstruction-freedom and step contention. We consider several classes of obstruction-free implementations, present corresponding generic object implementations, and prove lower bounds on their complexity. Viewed collectively, our results establish that the worst-case operation time complexity of obstruction-free implementations is high, even in the absence of step contention. We also show that lock-based implementations are not subject to some of the time-complexity lower bounds we present.
