The equivalence problem for deterministic real-time pushdown automata is shown to be decidable. This result is obtained by showing that Valiant's parallel stacking technique using a replacement function introduced in this paper succeeds for deterministic real-time pushdown automata. Equivalence is also decidable for two deterministic pushdown automata, one of which is real-time.
