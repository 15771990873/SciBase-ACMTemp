IfCis a class of sets andAis not inC, then an infinite setHis aproper hard core for A with respect to C, ifH⊆Aand for everyC&egr;Csuch thatC⊆A,C&Cap;His finite. It is shown that ifCis a countable class of sets of strings that is closed under finite union and finite variation, then every infinite set not inChas a proper hard core with respect toC. In addition, the density of such generalized complexity cores is studied.
