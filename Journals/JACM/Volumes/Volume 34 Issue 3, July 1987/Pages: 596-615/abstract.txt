In this paper we develop a new data structure for implementing heaps (priority queues). Our structure,Fibonacci heaps(abbreviatedF-heaps), extends the binomial queues proposed by Vuillemin and studied further by Brown. F-heaps support arbitrary deletion from ann-item heap inO(logn) amortized time and all other standard heap operations inO(1) amortized time. Using F-heaps we are able to obtain improved running times for several network optimization algorithms. In particular, we obtain the following worst-case bounds, wherenis the number of vertices andmthe number of edges in the problem graph:O(nlogn+m) for the single-source shortest path problem with nonnegative edge lengths, improved fromO(mlog(m/n+2)n);O(n2logn+nm) for the all-pairs shortest path problem, improved fromO(nmlog(m/n+2)n);O(n2logn+nm) for the assignment problem (weighted bipartite matching), improved fromO(nmlog(m/n+2)n);O(m&bgr;(m, n)) for the minimum spanning tree problem, improved fromO(mlog log(m/n+2)n); where&bgr;(m, n) = min {i&uharl; log(i)n≤m/n}. Note that&bgr;(m, n) ≤ log*nifm≥n.Of these results, the improved bound for minimum spanning trees is the most striking, although all the results give asymptotic improvements for graphs of appropriate densities.
