This paper describes anO(n3logn) deterministic algorithm and anO(n3) Las Vegas algorithm for testing whether two given trivalent graphs onnvertices are isomorphic. In fact, the algorithms construct the set of all isomorphisms between two such graphs, presenting, in particular, generators for the group of all automorphisms of a trivalent graph. The algorithms are based upon the original polynomial-time solution to these problems by Luks but they introduce numerous speedups. These include improved permutation-group algorithms that exploit the structure of the underlying 2-groups. A remarkable property of the Las Vegas algorithm is that it computes the set of all isomorphisms between two trivalent graphs for the cost of computing only those isomorphisms that map a specified edge to a specified edge.
