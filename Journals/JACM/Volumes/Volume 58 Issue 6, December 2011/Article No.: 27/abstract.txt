In this article, we describe arandomized Shellsortalgorithm. This algorithm is a simple, randomized, data-oblivious version of the Shellsort algorithm that always runs inO(nlogn) time and succeeds in sorting any given input permutation with very high probability. Taken together, these properties imply applications in the design of new efficient privacy-preserving computations based on the secure multiparty computation (SMC) paradigm. In addition, by a trivial conversion of this Monte Carlo algorithm to its Las Vegas equivalent, one gets the first version of Shellsort with a running time that is provablyO(nlogn) with very high probability.
