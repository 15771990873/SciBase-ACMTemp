The Dahlquist stability analysis for ordinary differential equations is extended to the case of Volterra integro-differential equations. Thus the standard multistep methods can be generalized to furnish algorithms for solving integro-differential equations. Special starting procedures are discussed, and some numerical examples are presented.
