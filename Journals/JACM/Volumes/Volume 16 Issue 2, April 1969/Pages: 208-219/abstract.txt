This paper is a continuation of the studies of Fleck, Weeg, and others concerning the theory of automorphisms of ordinary automata and of the work of Gil pertaining to time varying automata. A certain restricted class of time-varying automata, namely the class of polyadic automata, is investigated in detail. The results of an investigation of relationships concerning the group of automorphisms, the polyadic group of defined polyadic automata and the structure of the polyadic automation and the ordinary automata associated and with the polyadic automaton is presented.
