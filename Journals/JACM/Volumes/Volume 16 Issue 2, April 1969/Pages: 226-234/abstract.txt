Letsandtbe states of a finite (deterministic) automatonA.tcan be reached fromsif there is a tapexsuch that, ifAis in statesand receivesx,Agoes to statet.We consider (1) automata in which the initial state can be reached from any final state, and (2) automata which can be brought to a known state from any unknown state by applying a predetermined tapex.Necessary and sufficient conditions for an ultimate definite automaton to have the former property are obtained. Every ultimate definite automatonAis shown to have the latter property; and a characterization is obtained for all tapes which bringAto a known state. Finally, those ultimate definite automata having the former property are shown to be precisely those which can be brought to the start state from any state by some tapex.
