A time-sharing queue serving a finite number of customers is described. It is assumed that both the service time and the time elapsing between termination of service and the next arrival of the same customer at the queue (service station) are exponential. The model was studied by Krishnamoorthi and Wood, but their results are not in complete agreement with the results of this paper. In addition, some new results are presented in terms of steady-state expectations.
