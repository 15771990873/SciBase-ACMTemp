Let C denote one of the complexity classes “polynomial time,” “logspace,” or “nondeterministic logspace.” We introduce a logicL(C)invand show generalizations and variants of the equivalence (L(C)invcaptures C if and only if there is an almost C-optimal algorithm in C for the setTautof tautologies of propositional logic). These statements are also equivalent to the existence of a listing of subsets in C ofTautby corresponding Turing machines and equivalent to the fact that a certain parameterized halting problem is in the parameterized complexity class XCuni.
