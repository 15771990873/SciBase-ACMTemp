We present an algorithm for sorting efficiently with parallel two-level memories. Our main result is an elegant, easy-to-implement, optimal,deterministicalgorithm for external sorting withDdisk drives. This result answers in the affirmative the open problem posed by Vitter and Shriver of whether an optimal algorithm exists that is deterministic. Our measure of performance is the number of parallel input/output (I/O) operations, in which each of theDdisks can simultaneously transfer a block ofBcontiguous records. We assume that internal memory can holdMrecords. Our algorithm sortsNrecords in the optimal bound of &thgr;((N/BD) log(N/B)/ log(M/B)) deterministically, and thus improves upon Vitter and Shriver's optimal randomized algorithm as well as the well-known deterministic but nonoptimal technique of disk striping. It is also practical to implement.
