Say that ak-CNF a formula isp-satisfiableif there exists a truth assignment satisfying a fraction 1 − 2−k&plus;p2−kof its clauses (note that everyk-CNF formula is 0-satisfiable). LetFk(n,m) denote a randomk-CNF formula onnvariables withmclauses. For everyk≥2 and everyr>0 we determinepand δ&equals;δ(k)&equals;O(k2−k/2) such that with probability tending to 1 asn→∞, a randomk-CNF formulaFk(n,rn) isp-satisfiable but not (p&plus;δ)-satisfiable.
