Given a matrixA, it is often desirable to find a good approximation toAthat has low rank. We introduce a simple technique for accelerating the computation of such approximations whenAhas strong spectral features, that is, when the singular values of interest are significantly greater than those of a random matrix with size and entries similar toA. Our technique amounts to independently sampling and/or quantizing the entries ofA, thus speeding up computation by reducing the number of nonzero entries and/or the length of their representation. Our analysis is based on observing that the acts of sampling and quantization can be viewed as adding a random matrixNtoA, whose entries are independent random variables with zero-mean and bounded variance. Since, with high probability,Nhas very weak spectral features, we can prove that the effect of sampling and quantization nearly vanishes when a low-rank approximation toA&plus;Nis computed. We give high probability bounds on the quality of our approximation both in the Frobenius and the 2-norm.
