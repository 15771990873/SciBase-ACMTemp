The deBruijn graphBnis the state diagram for ann-stage binary shift register. It has 2nvertices and 2n+ 1edges. In this papers, it is shown thatBncan be built by appropriately “wiring together“ (i.e., connecting together with extra edges) many isomorphic copies of a fixed graph, which is called abuilding blockforBn. The efficiency of such a building block is refined as the fraction of the edges ofBnwhich are present in the copies of the building block. It is then shown, among other things, that for   any &agr; < 1, there exists a graphGwhich is a building block forBnof efficiency > &agr; for all sufficiently largen. These results are illustrated by describing how a special hierarchical family of building blocks has been used to construct a very large Viterbi decoder (whose floorplan is the graphB13) which will be used on NASA'sGalileomission.
