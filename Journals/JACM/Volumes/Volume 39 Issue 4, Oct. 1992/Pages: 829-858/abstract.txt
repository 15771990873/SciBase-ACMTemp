The zero knowledge properties of interactive proof systems (IPSs) are studied in the case that the verifier is a 2-way probabilistic finite state automaton (2pfa). The following results are proved:(1) There is a languageLsuch thatLhas an IPS with 2pfa verifiers butLhas no zero knowledge IPS with 2pfa verifiers.(2) Consider the class of 2pfa's that are sweeping and that halt in polynomial expected time. There is a languageLsuch thatLhas a zero knowledge IPS with respect to this class of verifiers, andLcannot be recognized by any verifier in the class on its own.A new definition of zero knowledge is  introduced. This definition captures a concept of “zero knowledge” for IPSs that are used for language recognition.
