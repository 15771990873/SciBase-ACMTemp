As M. Abramowitz has kindly pointed out to us, the earliest known application of the ratio method of recursion with unnormalized functions rather than with the functions themselves is found in: j. C. P. MILLER, British Association for the Advancement of Science, Mathematical Tables, Vol. X, Bessel Function8, Part II, University Press (Cambridge) 1952, p. xvi.
The ratio method was used for desk calculation by C. W. JONES, A Short Table for the Bessel Functions Univcxsity Press, Cambridge (1952).
The ratio method for the generation of the cylindrical functions J(x) and Y,(x) is described by: J. B. RANDELS AND R. F. REEVES, Cornmunications A CM, l (May 1958).

In the case of the i,(x) a weaker expression for is given by: F. J. CORBATO, J. Chem. Phys. 24, 452 (1956).
