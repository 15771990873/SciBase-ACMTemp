A probabilistic model is developed for a multiprogramming computer configuration, i.e., one in which several program segments are simultaneously in main memory (core). The model relates speed and number of input-output devices, core size, and central processor speed to central processor and system productivity. Incorporated in the model are parameters describing the statistical variability of input-output and central processor activities. Thus the model permits comparisons between systems loaded with different mixtures of job types (“scientific” vs. “business” applications). Numerical comparisons of various systems are provided.
