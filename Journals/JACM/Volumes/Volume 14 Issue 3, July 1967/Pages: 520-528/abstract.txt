Ad-dimensional circuit code of spreads(also calledSIBs, code or circuit code of minimum distances) is a simple circuitQin the graph of thed-dimensional cube [0, 1]dsuch that any two vertices ofQdiffering in exactlyrcoordinates, withr<s, can be joined by a path formed fromredges ofQ. Such codes are designed to introduce error detection into certain analog-to-digital conversion systems. Longer codes correspond to increased accuracy of the system, and hence there is interest in determining the maximum lengthC(d,s) ofd-dimensional circuit codes of spreads. In the present study the author contributes to this problem for even values ofsby describing a method of combining a code of spreadswith a suitably related code of spreads-1 so as to produce a longer code of spreads.
