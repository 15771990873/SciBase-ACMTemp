It is shown in this paper that the stable feedback shift registers, when classified according to Hamming weight (the number of fundamental product terms in expanded sum of products form), are binomially distributed, i.e., are (2n-n- 1w) stable feedback shift registers of ordernwith Hamming weight equal tow. Using this relationship, a recursive algorithm is established which will generate all stable feedback shift registers of ordern. Formulas are also given for determining the number of stable feedback shift registers which havej+ 1 starting states andj+ 1 branch states, 0 ≤j≤ 2n-1- 1.
