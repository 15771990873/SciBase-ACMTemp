Any sequential machineMrepresents a functionfMfrom input sequences to output symbols. A functionfisrepresentableif some finite-state sequential machine represents it. The functionfMis called ann-th order approximationto a given functionfiffMis equal toffor all input sequences of length less than or equal ton. It is proved that, for an arbitrary nonrepresentable functionf, there are infinitely manynsuch that any sequential machine representing annth order approximation tofhas more thann/2 + 1 states. An analogous result is obtained for two-way sequential machines and, using these and related results, lower bounds are obtained for two-way sequential machines and, using these and related results, lower bounds are obtained on the amount of work tape required online and offline Turing machines that compute nonrepresentable functions.
