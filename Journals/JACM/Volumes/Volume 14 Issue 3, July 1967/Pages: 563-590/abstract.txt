A set equations in the quantitiesai(p), wherei= 1, 2, · · ·,mandpranges over a setRof lattice points inn-space, is called asystem of uniform recurrence equationsif the following property holds: Ifpandqare inRandwis an integern-vector, thenai(p) depends directly onaj(p-w) if and only ifai(q) depends directly onaj(q-w). Finite-difference approximations to systems of partial differential equations typically lead to such recurrence equations. The structure of such a system is specified by adependence graph Ghavingmvertices, in which the directed edges are labeled with integern-vectors. For certain choices of the setR, necessary and sufficient conditions onGare given for the existence of a schedule to compute all the quantitiesai(p) explicitly from their defining equations. Properties of such schedules, such as the degree to which computation can proceed “in parallel,” are characterized. These characterizations depend on a certain iterative decomposition of a dependence graph into subgraphs. Analogous results concerning implicit schedules are also given.
