A matching on a graph is a set of edges, no two of which share a vertex. A maximum matching contains the greatest number of edges possible. This paper presents an efficient implementation of Edmonds' algorithm for finding a maximum matching. The computation time is proportional toV3, whereVis the number of vertices; previous implementations of Edmonds' algorithm have computation time proportional toV4. The implementation is based on a system of labels that encodes the structure of alternating paths.
