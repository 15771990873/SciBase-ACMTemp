Exact and approximate algorithms are presented for scheduling independent tasks in a multiprocessor environment in which the processors have different speeds. Dynamic programming type algorithms are presented which minimize finish time and weighted mean flow time on two processors. The generalization tomprocessors is direct. These algorithms have a worst-case complexity which is exponential in the number of tasks. Therefore approximation algorithms of low polynomial complexity are also obtained for the above problems. These algorithms are guaranteed to obtain solutions that are close to the optimal. For the case of minimizing mean flow time onm-processors an algorithm is given whose complexity is O(nlogmn).
