Let ƒ(x) be one of the usual elementary functions (exp, log, artan, sin, cosh, etc.), and letM(n) be the number of single-precision operations required to multiplyn-bit integers. It is shown that ƒ(x) can be evaluated, with relative error&Ogr;(2-n), in&Ogr;(M(n)log (n)) operations asn→ ∞, for any floating-point numberx(with ann-bit fraction) in a suitable finite interval. From the Schönhage-Strassen bound onM(n), it follows that ann-bit approximation to ƒ(x) may be evaluated in&Ogr;(nlog2(n) log log(n)) operations. Special cases include the evaluation of constants such as &pgr;,e, ande&pgr;. The algorithms depend on the theory of elliptic integrals, using the arithmetic-geometric mean iteration and ascending Landen transformations.
