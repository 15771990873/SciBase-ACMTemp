The time-dependent equations for the M/M/1 queue can be reduced to a single equation for the expected queue size, but the equation is dependent onP0(t), the probability of no jobs in the system. An exact equation for the behavior ofP0(t) under special conditions is derived and an approximation relatingP0(t) toQ(t), the expected queue size at timet, is derived for the case when the change in queue size is slow compared to the service rate. It is found that the approximation affords a significant improvement over the use of a steady state approximation to the time-dependent queue and is simpler to use than the exact equations.
