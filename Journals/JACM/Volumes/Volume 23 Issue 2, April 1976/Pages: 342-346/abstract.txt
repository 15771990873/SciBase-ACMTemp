Upper and lower bounds on processor utilization for the queueing model M/G/1/N are derived. The upper bound is equal to the utilization for constant service times and the lower bound is approached when the average number of operations per busy period approaches one. These bounds show that the form of the processing time distribution can have a substantial effect on processor utilization. We show that the utilization will be near the lower bound if there are a large number of short processing times. The variance does not always give an accurate indication of the effect of the distribution on utilization.
