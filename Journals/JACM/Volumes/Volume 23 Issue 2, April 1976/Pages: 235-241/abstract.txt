Two algorithms for computing the multiplication table of a 2-group are described and discussed. One of the algorithms works in an element-by-element fashion; the other works in terms of subgroups generated by initial subsequences of the given sequence of generators. Estimates of computation times are given which show that the second algorithm is much more efficient than the first. It is also shown how the second algorithm can be modified to make it more useful, without using significantly more time.
