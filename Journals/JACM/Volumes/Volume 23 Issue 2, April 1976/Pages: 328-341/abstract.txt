A two-stage queueing network with feedback and a finite intermediate waiting room is studied. The first-stage server is blocked wheneverMrequests are enqueued in the second stage. The analysis of this system under exponential assumptions is carried out. An algorithm to calculate the stationary state probabilities is given and some special cases are considered.
