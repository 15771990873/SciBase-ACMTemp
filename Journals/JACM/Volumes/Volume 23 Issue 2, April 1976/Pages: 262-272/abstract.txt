A new algorithm is presented for constructing auxiliary digital search trees to aid in exact-match substring searching. This algorithm has the same asymptotic running time bound as previously published algorithms, but is more economical in space. Some implementation considerations are discussed, and new work on the modification of these search trees in response to incremental changes in the strings they index (the update problem) is presented.
