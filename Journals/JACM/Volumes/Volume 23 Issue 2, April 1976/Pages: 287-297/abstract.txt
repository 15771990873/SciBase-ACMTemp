This paper analyzes the distribution of trailing digits (tail end digits) of positive real floating-point numbers represented in arbitrary base&bgr;and randomly chosen from a logarithmic distribution. The analysis shows that thenth digit forn≥ 2 is actually approximately uniformly distributed. The approximation depends upon bothnand the base&bgr;. It becomes better asnincreases, and it is exact in the limit asn⇒ ∞. A table of this distribution is presented for various &bgr; andn, along with a table of the maximum digit by digit deviation &Dgr; of the logarithmic distribution from the uniform distribution. Various asymptotic results for &Dgr; are included. These results have application in resolving open questions of Henrici, of Kaneko and Liu, and of Tsao.
