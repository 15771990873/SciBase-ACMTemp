It is shown that all centralized absolute momentsE&verbar;Hn−EHn&verbar;α(α ≥ 0) of the heightHnof binary search trees of sizenand of the saturation levelHn′ are bounded. The methods used rely on the analysis of aretardeddifferential equation of the form Φ′(u) = −α−2Φ(u/α)2with α > 1. The method can also be extended to prove the same result for the height ofm-ary search trees. Finally the limiting behaviour of the distribution of the height of binary search trees is precisely determined.
