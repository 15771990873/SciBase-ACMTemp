We show that any explicit example for a tensorA: [n]r→Fwith tensor-rank ≥nr&cdot;(1−o(1)), wherer=r(n) ≤ logn/log lognis super-constant, implies an explicit super-polynomial lower bound for the size of general arithmetic formulas over F. This shows that strong enough lower bounds for the size of arithmetic formulas of depth 3 imply super-polynomial lower bounds for the size of general arithmetic formulas.One component of our proof is a new approach for homogenization and multilinearization of arithmetic formulas, that gives the following results:We show that for anyn-variate homogeneous polynomialfof degreer, if there exists a (fanin-2) formula of sizesand depthdforfthen there exists a homogeneous formula of sizeO((d+r+1 r) &cdot;s) forf. In particular, for anyr≤O(logn), if there exists a polynomial size formula forfthen there exists a polynomial size homogeneous formula forf. This refutes a conjecture of Nisan and Wigderson [1996] and shows that super-polynomial lower bounds for homogeneous formulas for polynomials of small degree imply super-polynomial lower bounds for general formulas.We show that for anyn-variate set-multilinear polynomialfof degreer, if there exists a (fanin-2) formula of sizesand depthdforf, then there exists a set-multilinear formula of sizeO((d+ 2)r&cdot;s) forf. In particular, for anyr≤O(logn/log logn), if there exists a polynomial size formula forfthen there exists a polynomial size set-multilinear formula forf. This shows that super-polynomial lower bounds for set-multilinear formulas for polynomials of small degree imply super-polynomial lower bounds for general formulas.
