The Johnson--Lindenstrauss lemma shows that anynpoints in Euclidean space (i.e., ℝnwith distances measured under the &ell;2norm) may be mapped down toO((logn)/&epsi;2) dimensions such that no pairwise distance is distorted by more than a (1 &plus; &epsi;) factor. Determining whether such dimension reduction is possible in &ell;1has been an intriguing open question. We show strong lower bounds for general dimension reduction in &ell;1. We give an explicit family ofnpoints in &ell;1such that any embedding with constant distortionDrequiresnΩ(1/D2)dimensions. This proves that there is no analog of the Johnson--Lindenstrauss lemma for &ell;1; in fact, embedding with any constant distortion requiresnΩ(1)dimensions. Further, embedding the points into &ell;1with (1&plus;&epsi;) distortion requiresn&half;−O(&epsi; log(1/&epsi;))dimensions. Our proof establishes this lower bound for shortest path metrics of series-parallel graphs. We make extensive use of linear programming and duality in devising our bounds. We expect that the tools and techniques we develop will be useful for future investigations of embeddings into &ell;1.
