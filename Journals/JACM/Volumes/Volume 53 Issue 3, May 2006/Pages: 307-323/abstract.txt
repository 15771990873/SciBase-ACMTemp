In this article, we show several results obtained by combining the use ofstable distributionswithpseudorandom generators for bounded space. In particular:---We show that, for anyp∈ (0, 2], one can maintain (using onlyO(logn/&epsi;2) words of storage) asketchC(q)of a pointq∈lnpunder dynamic updates of its coordinates. The sketch has the property that, givenC(q)andC(s), one can estimate &Verbar;q−s&Verbar;pup to a factor of (1 &plus; &epsi;) with large probability. This solves the main open problem of Feigenbaum et al. [1999].---We show that the aforementioned sketching approach directly translates into an approximate algorithm that, for a fixed linear mappingA, and givenx∈ ℜnandy∈ ℜm, estimates &Verbar;Ax−y&Verbar;pinO(n&plus;m) time, for anyp∈ (0, 2]. This generalizes an earlier algorithm of Wasserman and Blum [1997] which worked for the casep&equals; 2.---We obtain another sketch functionC′ which probabilistically embedsln1into anormed spacelm1. The embedding guarantees that, if we setm&equals; log(1/δ)O(1/&epsi;), then for any pair of pointsq,s∈ln1, the distance betweenqandsdoes notincreaseby more than (1 &plus; &epsi;) with constant probability, and it does notdecreaseby more than (1 − &epsi;) with probability 1 − δ. This is the only known dimensionality reduction theorem for thel1norm. In fact, stronger theorems of this type (i.e., that guarantee very low probability of expansion as well as of contraction) cannot exist [Brinkman and Charikar 2003].---We give an explicit embedding ofln2intolnO(logn)1with distortion (1 &plus; 1/nΘ(1)).
