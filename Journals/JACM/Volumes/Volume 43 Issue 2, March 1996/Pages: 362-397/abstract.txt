Categorical combinators [Curien 1986/1993; Hardin 1989; Yokouchi 1989] and more recently &lgr;&sgr;-calculus [Abadi 1991; Hardin and Le´vy 1989], have been introduced to provide an explicit treatment of substitutions in the &lgr;-calculus. We reintroduce here the ingredients of these calculi in a self-contained and stepwise way, with a special emphasis on confluence properties. The main new results of the paper with respect to Curien [1986/1993], Hardin [1989], Abadi [1991], and Hardin and Le´vy [1989] are the following:(1) We present a confluent weak calculus of substitutions, where no variable clashes can be feared; (2) We solve a conjecture raised in Abadi [1991]: &lgr;&sgr;-calculus is not confluent (it is confluent on ground terms only).This unfortunate result is “repaired” by presenting a confluent version of &lgr;&sgr;-calculus, named the &lgr;Env-caldulus in Hardin and Le´vy [1989], called here the confluent &lgr;&sgr;-calculus.
