There has been considerable recent interest in probabilistic packet marking schemes for the problem of tracing a sequence of network packets back to an anonymous source. An important consideration for such schemes is the number of packet header bits that need to be allocated to the marking protocol. Letbdenote this value. All previous schemes belong to a class of protocols for whichbmust be at least logn, wherenis the number of bits used to represent the path of the packets. In this article, we introduce a new marking technique for tracing a sequence of packets sent along the same path. This new technique is effective even whenb= 1. In other words, the sequence of packets can be traced back to their source using only a single bit in the packet header. With this scheme, the number of packets required to reconstruct the path isO(22n), but we also show that Ω(2n) packets are required for any protocol whereb= 1. We also study the trade-off betweenband the number of packets required. We provide a protocol and a lower bound that together demonstrate that for the optimal protocol, the number of packets required (roughly) increases exponentially withn, but decreases doubly exponentially withb. The protocol we introduce is simple enough to be useful in practice. We also study the case where the packets are sent alongkdifferent paths. For this case, we demonstrate that any protocol must use at least log(2k− 1) header bits. We also provide a protocol that requires ⌈log(2k&plus; 1)⌉ header bits in some restricted scenarios. This protocol introduces a new coding technique that may be of independent interest.
