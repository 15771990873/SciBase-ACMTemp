We present an algorithm for directed acyclic graphs that breaks through theO(n2) barrier on the single-operation complexity of fully dynamic transitive closure, wherenis the number of edges in the graph. We can answer queries inO(nε) worst-case time and perform updates inO(nω(1,ε,1)−ε&plus;n1&plus;ε) worst-case time, for any ε∈[0,1], where ω(1,ε,1) is the exponent of the multiplication of ann×nεmatrix by annε×nmatrix. The current best bounds on ω(1,ε,1) imply anO(n0.575) query time and anO(n1.575) update time in the worst case. Our subquadratic algorithm is randomized, and has one-sided error. As an application of this result, we show how to solve single-source reachability inO(n1.575) time per update and constant time per query.
