We provide two algorithms for computing the volume of the convex polytope Ω : = {x∈ ℝn+|Ax≤b}, forA, ∈ ℝm×n,b∈ ℝn. The computational complexity of both algorithms is essentially described bynm, which makes them especially attractive for largenand relatively smallm, when the other methods withO(mn) complexity fail. The methodology, which differs from previous existing methods, uses a Laplace transform technique that is well suited to the half-space representation of Ω.
