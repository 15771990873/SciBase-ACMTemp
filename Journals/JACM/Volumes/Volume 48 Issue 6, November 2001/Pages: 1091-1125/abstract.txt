The idea of preprocessing part of the input of a problem in order to improve efficiency has been employed by several researchers in several areas of computer science. In this article, we show sufficient conditions to prove that an intractable problem cannot be efficiently solved even allowing an exponentially long preprocessing phase. The generality of such conditions is shown by applying them to various problems coming from different fields. While the results may seem to discourage the use of compilation, we present some evidence that such negative results are useful in practice.
