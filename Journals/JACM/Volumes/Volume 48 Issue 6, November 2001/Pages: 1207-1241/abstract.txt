We study extensions of the process algebra axiom systemACPwith two recursive operations: thebinary Kleene star*, which is defined byx*y=x(x*y+y, and thepush-downoperation$, defined byx$y=x((x$y)(x$y)) +y. In this setting it is easy to represent register machine computation, and an equational theory results that is not decidable. In order to increase the expressive power, abstraction is then added: withrooted branching bisimulation equivalenceeach computable process can be expressed, and withrooted Ã´-bisimilarityeach semi-computable process that initially is finitely branching can be expressed. Moreover, with abstraction and a finite number of auxiliary actions these results can be obtained without binary Kleene star. Finally, we consider two alternatives for the push-down operation. Each of these gives rise to similar results.
