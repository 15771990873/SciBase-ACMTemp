A formal model of a problem is developed and its relationship to the General Problem Solver (GPS) is discussed. Before GPS can work on a problem it must be given differences, a difference-ordering, and a table of connections, in addition to the specifications of a problem. Formal definitions of this additional information are given, and sufficient conditions for the success of GPS are derived. These conditions point out the utility of differences and a difference-ordering that yield a “triangular” table of connections. Several different formulations of the Tower of Hanoi are given to illustrate the formal concepts. The use of subproblems in narrowing search is discussed.
