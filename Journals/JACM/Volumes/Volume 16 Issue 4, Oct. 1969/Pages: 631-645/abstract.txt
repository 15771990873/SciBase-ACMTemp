The paper deals with computer time-sharing disciplines in which external priorities are introduced. For a computer system under a time-sharing discipline, the following priority disciplines are discussed: (a) head-of-the-line; (b) preemptive repeat; and (c) mixed preemptive strategy. All models in question assume that customers arrive according to homogeneous Poisson processes, and that service times are mutually independent exponentially distributed random variables. Results are given in terms of steady-state expectations.
