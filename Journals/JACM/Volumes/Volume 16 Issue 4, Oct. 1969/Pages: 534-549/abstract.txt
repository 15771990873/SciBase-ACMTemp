An algorithm for the determination of the skeleton of a polygonal figure is presented. The propagation of the figure contour is simulated analytically. All skeleton branch points are obtained, in an order which depends on their distance from the contour, together with the equations of the skeleton branches connecting them. The computing time for polygons with few concave vertices is roughly proportional to the number of sides.
