When the algorithms of J. T. Welch, Jr. were implemented it was discovered that they did not perform as described. The generation of all cycles from a basis is faulty. The generation of the basis is apparently correct. A modified version of Welch's Algorithm 3 is presented. The reasons for modifying Welch's algorithms are presented with examples.
