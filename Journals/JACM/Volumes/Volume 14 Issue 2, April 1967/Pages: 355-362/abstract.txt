A simple “mechanical” procedure is described for checking equality of regular expressions. The procedure, based on the work of A. Salomaa, uses derivatives of regular expressions and transition graphs.Given a regular expressionR, a corresponding transition graph is constructed. It is used to generate a finite set of left-linear equations which characterizeR. Two regular eventsRandSare equal if and only if each constant term in the set of left-linear equations formed for the pair (R S) is (&phgr; &phgr;) or (^ ^).The procedure does not involve any computations with or transformations of regular expressions and is especially appropriate for the use of a computer.
