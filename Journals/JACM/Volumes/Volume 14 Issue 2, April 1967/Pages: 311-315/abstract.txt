The method of steepest descent is applied in a convergent procedure to determine the zeros of polynomials having either real or complex coefficients. By expressing the polynomials in terms of the Siljak functions, the methods are readily programmed on a digital computer. The significance of the procedures is that their application is straightforward, and not only is convergence rapid in the region of a zero but convergence is guaranteed independent of the initial values.
