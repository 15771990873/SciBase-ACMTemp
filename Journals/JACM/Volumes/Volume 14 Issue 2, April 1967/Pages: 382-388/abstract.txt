If an automaton is strongly connected, all of its automorphisms are regular permutations. It is proved that given any two groupsGandHof regular permutations on finite setsAandB, respectively, there exists strongly connected automata @@@@ and @@@@ such thatGandHare the automorphisms groups of @@@@ and @@@@, @@@@ × @@@@ is strongly connected and the automorphism group of @@@@ × @@@@ isG×H. Also it is proved that the reduced semigroup of an automaton is a regular group of permutations iff the automorphism group of @@@@ is regular and @@@@ is strongly connected. Using this result we construct examples where the automorphism groups have the above property forallstrongly connected automata onAandB, and other examples where the automorphism group of @@@@ × @@@@ properly containsG×H.
