An iterative array is defined as an infinite set of identical blocks, interconnected in a regular manner. Each block has inputs and outputs, with internal connections from certain inputs to certain outputs. This paper is concerned with the problem of determining, for a given structure internal to each block, the existence of a given path. The path is specified by the relative positions in the array of its endpoints, and the algorithm presented decides whether such a path is possible in the given array. A special case of the general procedure, which tests for a closed path, has been successfully programmed.
