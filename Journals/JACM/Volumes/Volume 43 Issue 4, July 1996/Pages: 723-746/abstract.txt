Sharing data between multiple asynchronous users—each of which can atomically read and write the data—is a feature that may help to increase the amount of parallelism in distributed systems. An algorithm implementing this feature is presented. The main construction of ann-user atomic variable directly from single-writer, single-reader atomic variables usesO(n)control bits andO(n)accesses per Read/Write running inO(1)parallel time.
