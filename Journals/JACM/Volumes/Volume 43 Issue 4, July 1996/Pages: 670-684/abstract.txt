The exponent of periodicity is an important factor in estimates of complexity of word-unification algorithms. We prove that the exponent of periodicity of a minimal solution of a word equation is of order 21.07d, wheredis the length of the equation. We also give a lower bound 20.29dso our upper bound is almost optimal and exponentially better than the original bound(6d)22d4+ 2. Consequently, our result implies an exponential improvement of known upper bounds on complexity of word-unification algorithms.
