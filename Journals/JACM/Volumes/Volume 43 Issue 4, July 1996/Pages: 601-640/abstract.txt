This paper present a new approach to finding minimum cuts in undirected graphs. The fundamental principle is simple: the edges in a graph's minimum cut form an extremely small fraction of the graph's edges. Using this idea, we give a randomized, strongly polynomial algorithm that finds the minimum cut in an arbitrarily weighted undirected graph with high probability. The algorithm runs inO(n2log3n)time, a significant improvement over the previousO˜(mn)time bounds based on maximum flows. It is simple and intuitive and uses no complex data structures. Our algorithm can be parallelized to run inRNCwithn2processors; this gives the first proof   that the minimum cut problem can be solved inRNC. The algorithm does more than find a single minimum cut; it finds all of them.With minor modifications, our algorithm solves two other problems of interest. Our algorithm finds all cuts with value within a multiplicative factor of &agr; of the minimum cut's in expectedO˜(n2&agr;)time, or inRNCwithn2&agr;processors. The problem of finding a minimum multiway cut of graph intorpieces is solved in expectedO˜(n2(r-1))time, or inRNCwithn2(r-1)processors. The “trace” of the    algorithm's execution on these two problems forms a new compact data structure for representing all small cuts and all multiway cuts in a graph. This data structure can be efficiently transformed into the more standard cactus representing for minimum cuts.
