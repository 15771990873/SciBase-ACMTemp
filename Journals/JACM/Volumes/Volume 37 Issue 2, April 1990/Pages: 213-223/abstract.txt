Efficient implementations of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm are investigated. A new data structure, called theradix heap, is proposed for use in this algorithm. On a network withnvertices,medges, and nonnegative integer arc costs bounded byC, a one-level form of radix heap gives a time bound for Dijkstra's algorithm ofO(m+nlogC). A two-level form of radix heap gives a bound ofO(m+nlogC/log logC). A combination of a radix heap and a previously known data structure called aFibonacci heapgives a bound ofO(m+na @@@@logC). The best previously known bounds areO(m+nlogn) using Fibonacci heaps alone andO(mlog logC) using the priority queue structure of Van Emde Boas et al. [ 17].
