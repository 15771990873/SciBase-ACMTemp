We establish lower bounds on the complexity of orthogonal range reporting in the static case. Given a collection ofnpoints ind-space and a box [a1,b1] X … X [ad,bd], report every point whoseith coordinate lies in [ai, bi], for eachi= l, … ,d. The collection of points is fixed once and for all and can be preprocessed. The box, on the other hand, constitutes a query that must be answered online. It is shown that on a pointer machine a query time ofO(k+ polylog(n)), wherekis the number of points to be reported, can only be achieved at the expense of &OHgr;(n(logn/log logn)d-1) storage. Interestingly, these bounds are optimal in the pointer machine model, but they can be improved (ever so slightly) on a random access machine. In a companion paper, we address the related problem of adding up weights assigned to the points in the query box.
