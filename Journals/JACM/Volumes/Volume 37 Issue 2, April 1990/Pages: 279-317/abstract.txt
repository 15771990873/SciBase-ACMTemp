This paper presents a proof system for first-order temporal logic. The system extends the nonclausal resolution method for ordinary first-order logic with equality, to handle quantifiers and temporal operators. Soundness and completeness issues are considered. The use of the system for verifying concurrent programs is discussed and variants of the system for other modal logics are also described.
