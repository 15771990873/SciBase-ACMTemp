We give an algorithm to learn an intersection ofkhalfspaces inRnwhose normals span anl-dimensional subspace. For any input distribution with alogconcavedensity such that the bounding hyperplanes of thekhalfspaces pass through its mean, the algorithm (&epsis;,δ)-learns with time and sample complexity bounded by (nkl/&epsis;)O(l)log 1/&epsis; δ. The hypothesis found is an intersection ofO(klog (1/&epsis;)) halfspaces. This improves on Blum and Kannan's algorithm for the uniform distribution over a ball, in the time and sample complexity (previously doubly exponential) and in the generality of the input distribution.
