This paper analyzes a recently published algorithm for page replacement in hierarchical paged memory systems [O'Neil et al. 1993]. The algorithm is called the LRU-Kmethod, and reduces to the well-known LRU (Least Recently Used) method forK= 1. Previous work [O'Neil et al. 1993; Weikum et al. 1994; Johnson and Shasha 1994] has shown the effectiveness forK> 1 by simulation, especially in the most common case ofK= 2. The basic idea in LRU-Kis to keep track of the times of the lastKreferences to memory pages, and to use this statistical information to rank-order the pages as to their expected future behavior. Based on this the page replacement policy decision is made: which  memory-resident page to replace when a newly accessed page must be read into memory. In the current paper, we prove, under the assumptions of the independent reference model, that LRU-Kis optimal. Specifically we show: given the times of the (up to)Kmost recent references to each disk page, no other algorithmAmaking decisions to keep pages in a memory buffer holdingn- 1 pages based on this infomation can improve on the expected number of I/Os to access pages over the LRU-Kalgorithm using a memory buffer holdingnpages. The proof uses the Bayesian formula to relate the space of actual page probabilities of the model to the space of observable page numbers on which the replacement decision is  acutally made.
