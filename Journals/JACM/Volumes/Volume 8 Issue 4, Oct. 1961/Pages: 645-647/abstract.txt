Let ƒ (x) be a real-valued function defined and continuous on [- 1, +1] and letT(x) =a0/2 + ∑∞k=1akTk(x) be the Fourier-Tschebycheff expansion for ƒ (x), that is,Tk(x) = coskl&thgr;,ak= 2/&pgr; ∫&pgr;0ƒ (cos&thgr;) cosk&thgr; d&thgr;wherex= cos&thgr;. IfPnis the class of real polynomials inxof degree less than or equal ton, we letMn= infpePnsup-1≤x≤1| ƒ (x) -p(x) |.Mnis called the best Tschebycheff approximation to ƒ (x) by a polynomial of degree less than or equal ton.A rule of thumb in computing is that |Mn/an+1| → 1 asn→ ∞. In other words, the best Tschebycheff approximation to ƒ (x) of degreenis asymptotically equal to the (n+ 1)th coefficient in the Tschebycheff expansion. It is the purpose of this note to give upper and lower bounds forMnin terms of the coefficients {ak}, which will enable us to make precise statements about the validity of this asymptotic result. It has already been observed by Bernstein [1, p. 115] that under appropriate hypotheses on ƒ(x) there exists a subsequence {kj} for which |Mkj/akj+1| → 1. We show here that if {akj} is the subsequence of {ak} consisting of the nonzero coefficients, then a sufficient condition for limj→∞ |Mkj-1/akj| = 1 (1) is for limj→∞akj+1| = 0. If this latter condition holds ƒ (z) = 1/2a0+ ∑∞n=1anTn(z) is an entire function. An easy example shows that (1) is not valid, however, for all entire functions.We note first some easily derived bounds forMn. If the seriesT(x) converges to ƒ (x), thenMn≤ sup-1≤x≤1| ƒ (x) - 1/2a0- ∑nk=1akTk(x) | ≤ ∑∞k=n+1|ak|.Therefore, if ∑∞k=1|ak| < ∞, ∑∞k=n+1|ak| is an upper bound forMn. Again, if the seriesT(x) converges, a lower bound forMnis given by La Vallee Poussin [2, p. 107], i.e.,Mn&gE; |an+1+a3(n+1)+a5(n+1)+ ··· |.(2) Another lower bound forMnin terms of the coefficientsanmay also be obtained. From the fact that thenth partial sum of the Fourier cosine series gives the best least squares approximation to ƒ (cos&thgr;) we have 1/&pgr; ∫&pgr;0ƒ(cos&thgr;) -a0/2 - ∑n1akcosk&thgr;]2d&thgr;≤Mn2. But by Parseval's theorem 1/&pgr; ∫&pgr;0ƒ(cos&thgr;) -a0/2 - ∑n1akcosk&thgr;]2d&thgr;= 1/2 ∑∞n=1ak2. Therefore,Mn&gE; { 1/2 ∑∞n+1ak2}1/2and, in particular,Mn&gE; 1/√2 |am| form>n. (3) We now can prove the following result.THEOREM.Let{akj}be the subsequence of the{ak}consisting of all the nonzero coefficeints.If for all j
