In this paper we study the problem of on-line allocation of routes to virtual circuits (bothpoint-to-pointandmulticast) where the goal is to route all requests while minimizing the required bandwidth.  We concentrate on the case ofPermanentvirtual circuits (i.e., once a circuit is established it exists forever), and describe an algorithm that achieves onO(logn) competitive ratio with respect to maximum congestin, wherenis the number of nodes in the network.  Informally, our results show that instead of knowing all of the future requests, it is sufficient to increase the bandwidth of the communication links by anO(logn) factor.  We also show that this result is tight, that is, for any on-line algorithm there exists a scenario in which ***(logn) increase in  bandwidth is necessary in directed networks.We view virtual circuit routing as a generalization of an on-line load balancing problem, defined as follows: jobs arrive on line and each job must be assigned to one of the machines immediately upon arrival.  Assigning a job to a machine increases the machine's load by an amount that depends both on the job and on the machine.  The goal is to minimize the maximum load.For therelated machinescase, we describe the first algorithm that achieves constant competitive ratio. for theunrelatedcase (withnmachines), we describe a new method that yieldsO(logn)-competitive algorithm.  This stands in contrast to the natural greed approach, whose competitive ratio is exactlyn.show that this result is tight, that is, for any on-line algorithm there exists a scenario in which ***(logn) increase in bandwidth is necessary in directed networks.
