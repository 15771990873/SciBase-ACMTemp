We consider a processor shared M/M/1 queue that can accommodate at most a finite numberKof customers. Using singular perturbation techniques, we construct asymptotic approximations to the distribution of a customer's sojourn time. We assume thatKis large and treat several different cases of the model parameters and also treat different time scales. Extensive numerical comparisons are used to back up our asymptotic formulas.â€”Author's Abstract
