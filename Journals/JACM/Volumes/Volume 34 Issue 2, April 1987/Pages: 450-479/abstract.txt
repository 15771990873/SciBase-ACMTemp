In this paper concurrent dynamic logic (CDL) is introduced as an extension of dynamic logic tailored toward handling concurrent programs. Properties of CDL are discussed, both on the propositional and first-order level, and the extension is shown to possess most of the desirable properties of DL. Its relationships with the &mgr;-calculus, game logic, DL with recursive procedures, and PTIME are further explored, revealing natural connections between concurrency, recursion, and alternation.
