A graphical representation of quantifier-free predicate calculus formulas in negation normal form and a new rule of inference that employs this representation are introduced. The new rule,path resolution, is an amalgamation of resolution and Prawitz analysis. The goal in the design of path resolution is to retain some of the advantages of both Prawitz analysis and resolution methods, and yet to avoid to some extent their disadvantages.Path resolution allows Prawitz analysis of an arbitrary subgraph of the graph representing a formula. If such a subgraph is not large enough to demonstrate a contradiction, a path resolvent of the subgraph may be generated with respect to the entire graph. This generalizes the notions of large inference present in hyperresolution, clash-resolution, NC-resolution, and UR-resolution. A class of subgraphs is described for which deletion of some of the links resolved upon preserves the spanning property.
