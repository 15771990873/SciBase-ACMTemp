New, improved algorithms are proposed for regulating access to a multiple-access channel, a common channel shared by many geographically distributed computing stations. A conflict ofmultiplicity noccurs whennstations transmit simultaneously to the channel. As a result, all stations receive feedback indicating whethernis 0, 1, or ≥2. Ifn= 1, the transmission succeeds; whereas ifn≥ 2, all the transmissions fail. Algorithms are presented and analyzed that allow the conflicting stations to compute a stochastic estimaten*ofn, cooperatively, at small cost, as a function of the feedback elicited during its execution. An algorithm toresolvea conflict among two or more stations controls the retransmissions of the conflicting stations so that each eventually transmits singly to the channel. Combining one of our estimation algorithms with a tree algorithm (of Capetanakis, Hayes, and Tsybakov and Mikhailov) then leads to a hybrid algorithm for conflict resolution. Several efficient combinations are possible, the most efficient of which resolves conflicts about 20 percent faster on average than any of the comparable algorithms reported to date.
