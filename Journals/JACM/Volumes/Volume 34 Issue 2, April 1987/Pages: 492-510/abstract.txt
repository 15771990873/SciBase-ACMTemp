This paper is concerned with the question of thedecidabilityand thecomplexityof the decision problem for certain fragments of the theory of freeterm algebras. The existential fragment of the theory of term algebras is shown to be decidable through the presentation of a nondeterministic algorithm, which, given a quantifier-free formulaP, constructs a solution forPif it has one and indicates failure if there are no solutions. It is shown that the decision problem is in NP by proving that, if a quantifier-free formulaPhas a solution, then there is one that can be represented as a dag in space at most cubic in the length ofP. The decision problem is shown to be complete for NP by reducing 3-SAT to that problem. Thus it is established that the existential fragment of the theory of pure list structures in the language of NIL, CONS, CAR, CDR, =, â‰¤ (subexpression) is NP-complete. It is further shown that even a slightly more expressive fragment of the theory of term algebras, the one that allows bounded universal quantifiers, is undecidable.
