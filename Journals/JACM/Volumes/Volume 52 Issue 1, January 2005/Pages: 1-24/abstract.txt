LetG=(V,E)be an undirectedweightedgraph with &verbar;V&verbar; =nand &verbar;E&verbar; =m. Letk≥ 1 be an integer. We show thatG=(V,E)can be preprocessed inO(kmn1/k) expected time, constructing a data structure of sizeO(kn1&plus;1/k), such that any subsequentdistance querycan be answered, approximately, inO(k)time. The approximate distance returned is of stretch at most2k−1, that is, the quotient obtained by dividing the estimated distance by the actual distance lies between 1 and2k−1. A 1963 girth conjecture of Erdós, implies that Ω(n1&plus;1/k) space is needed in the worst case for any real stretch strictly smaller than 2k&plus;1. The space requirement of our algorithm is, therefore, essentially optimal. The most impressive feature of our data structure is itsconstantquery time, hence the name "oracle". Previously, data structures that used onlyO(n1&plus;1/k) space had a query time of Ω(n1/k).Our algorithms are extremely simple and easy to implement efficiently. They also provide faster constructions of sparsespannersof weighted graphs, and improvedtree coversanddistance labelingsof weighted or unweighted graphs.
