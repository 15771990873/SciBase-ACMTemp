In this article, we present an approximation algorithm for solving the single source shortest paths problem on weighted polyhedral surfaces. We consider a polyhedral surfacePas consisting ofntriangular faces, where each face has an associated positive weight. The cost of travel through a face is the Euclidean distance traveled, multiplied by the face's weight. For a given parameter &epsiv;, 0 <&epsiv; < 1, the cost of the computed paths is at most 1 &plus; &epsiv; times the cost of corresponding shortest paths. Our algorithm is based on a novel way of discretizing polyhedral surfaces and utilizes a generic greedy approach for computing shortest paths in geometric graphs obtained by such discretization. Its running time isO(C(P)n/&sqrt;&epsiv; logn/&epsiv; log 1/&epsiv;) time, whereC(P)captures geometric parameters and the weights of the faces ofP.
