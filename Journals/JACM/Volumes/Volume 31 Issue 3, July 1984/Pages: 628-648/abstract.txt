A popular means of increasing the effective rate of main storage
accesses in a large computer is a multiplicity of memory modules
accessible in parallel. Although such an organization usually
achieves a net gain in access rate, it also creates new modes of
congestion at the storage controller. This paper analyzes the
variables that describe such a congestion: queue lengths and
delays. A controller that maintains separate register sets to
accommodate the request queue of each module is considered. The
various processors attached to the storage are assumed to generate,
in each memory cycle, a number of access requests with the same
given distribution. The addresses specified by these requests
(reduced to the module index) are further assumed to follow the
states of a first-order Markov chain. The analysis then becomes one
of a single-server queuing system with constant service time and
indexed batch arrival process. Results are derived for several
descriptors of the congestion and thus of the quality of service
offered by such an organization. The aim throughout is to embody
the results in a form readily suitable for numerical
evaluation.
