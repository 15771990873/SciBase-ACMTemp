An intuitive presentation of the trace method for the abstract
specification of software contains sample specifications, syntactic
and semantic definitions of consistency and totalness, methods for
proving specifications consistent and total, and a comparison of
the method with the algebraic approach to specification. This
intuitive presentation is underpinned by a formal syntax,
semantics, and derivation system for the method. Completeness and
soundness theorems establish the correctness of the derivation
system with respect to the semantics, the coextensiveness of the
syntactic definitions of consistency and totalness with their
semantic counterparts, and the correctness of the proof methods
presented. Areas for future research are discussed.
