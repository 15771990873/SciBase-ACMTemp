A randomized algorithm that sorts on anNnode network with constant valence inO(logN) time is given. More particularly, the algorithm sortsNitems on anN-node cube-connected cycles graph, and, for some constantk, for all large enough&agr;, it terminates withink&agr;logNtime with probability at least 1 -N-&agr;.
