A sequential network is said to be controllable if there exists at least one integerksuch that it is possible to transition between any pair of arbitrary states (S&agr;,S&bgr;) in exactlyksteps. In this paper, necessary and sufficient conditions are given for a nonlinear sequential network to be controllable. Strong connectedness is a necessary condition for controllability. It is shown that the existence of two cyclesC1andC2on a strongly connected sequential network, whose cycle lengthsL1andL2are relatively prime, is both necessary and sufficient for controllability. Simple test procedures are also developed which determine if a sequential network is controllable and which determine the transition sequences.
