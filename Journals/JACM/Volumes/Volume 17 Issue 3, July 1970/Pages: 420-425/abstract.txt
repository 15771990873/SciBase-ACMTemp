The nonlinear interpolation of functions of very many variables is discussed. Deterministic termwise assessment of a prohibitively large number of terms naturally leads to a choice of random sampling from these numerous terms. After introduction of an appropriate higher order interpolation formula, a working algorithm is established by the Monte Carlo method. Numerical examples are also given.
