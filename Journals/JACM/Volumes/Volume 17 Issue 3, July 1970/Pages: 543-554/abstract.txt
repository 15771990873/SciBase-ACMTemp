Directed graphs having logical control associated with each vertex have been introduced as models of computational tasks for automatic assignment and sequencing on parallel processor systems. A brief review of their properties is given. A procedure to test the “legality” of graphs in this class is described, and leads to algorithms for counting the number of all possible executions (AND-type subgraphs), and for evaluating the probability of ever reaching a given vertex in the graph. Numerical results are given for some example graphs.
