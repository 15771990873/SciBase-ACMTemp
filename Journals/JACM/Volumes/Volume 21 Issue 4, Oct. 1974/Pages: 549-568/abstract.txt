This paper describes an efficient algorithm to determine whether an arbitrary graphGcan be embedded in the plane. The algorithm may be viewed as an iterative version of a method originally proposed by Auslander and Parter and correctly formulated by Goldstein. The algorithm used depth-first search and hasO(V) time and space bounds, whereVis the number of vertices inG. An ALGOL implementation of the algorithm succesfully tested graphs with as many as 900 vertices in less than 12 seconds.
