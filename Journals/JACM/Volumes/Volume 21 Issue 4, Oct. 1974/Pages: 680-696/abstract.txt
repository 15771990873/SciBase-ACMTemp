The fundamentals of Post algebras are presented and Post and Boolean functions are examined. A functional representation is developed that facilitates the comparison of Post and Boolean algebras. Based on this representation, relationships between finite, higher-order (that is, more than 2-valued) Boolean algebras and functions in these algebras and finite, higher-order Post algebras and their corresponding functions are develop.
