A search procedure is given which will determine whether Hamilton paths or circuits exist in a given graph, and will find one or all of them. A combined procedure is given for both directed and undirected graphs. The search consists of creating partial paths and making deductions which determine whether each partial path is a section of any Hamilton path whatever, and which direct the extension of the partial paths.
