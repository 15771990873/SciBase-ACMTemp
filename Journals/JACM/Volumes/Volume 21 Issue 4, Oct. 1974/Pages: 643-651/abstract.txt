The problem is to calculate a simple zero of a nonlinear function ƒ by iteration. There is exhibited a family of iterations of order 2n-1which usenevaluations of ƒ and no derivative evaluations, as well as a second family of iterations of order 2n-1based onn— 1 evaluations of ƒ and one of ƒ′. In particular, with four evaluations an iteration of eighth order is constructed. The best previous result for four evaluations was fifth order.It is proved that theoptimalorder of one general class of multipoint iterations is 2n-1and that an upper bound on the order of a multipoint iteration based onnevaluations of ƒ (no derivatives) is 2n.It is conjectured that a multipoint iteration without memory based onnevaluations has optimal order 2n-1.
