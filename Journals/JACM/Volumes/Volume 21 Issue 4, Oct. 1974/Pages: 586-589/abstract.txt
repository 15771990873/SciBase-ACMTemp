From Richardson's undecidability results, it is shown that the predictive “there exists a real numberrsuch thatG(r) = 0” is recursively undecidable forG(x) in a class of functions which involves polynomials and the sine function. The deduction follows that the convergence of a class of improper integrals is recursively undecidable.
