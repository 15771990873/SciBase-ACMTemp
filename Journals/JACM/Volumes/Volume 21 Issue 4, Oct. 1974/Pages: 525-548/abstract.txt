A parsing method for strict deterministic grammars is presented and a technique for using it to parse any deterministic language is indicated. An important characterization of the trees of strict deterministic grammars is established. This is used to prove iteration theorems for (strict) deterministic languages, and hence proving that certain sets are not in these families becomes comparatively straightforward. It is shown that every strict deterministic grammar is LR(0) and that any strict deterministic grammar is equivalent to a bounded right context (1, 0) grammar. Thus rigorous proofs that the families of deterministic, LR (k), and bounded right context languages are coextensive are presented for the first time.
