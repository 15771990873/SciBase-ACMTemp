We give the firstpolynomial-time approximation scheme(PTAS) for theSteiner forestproblem on planar graphs and, more generally, on graphs of bounded genus. As a first step, we show how to build aSteiner forest spannerfor such graphs. The crux of the process is a clustering procedure calledprize-collecting clusteringthat breaks down the input instance into separate subinstances which are easier to handle; moreover, the terminals in different subinstances are far from each other. Each subinstance has a relatively inexpensive Steiner tree connecting all its terminals, and the subinstances can be solved (almost) separately. Another building block is a PTAS forSteiner foreston graphs of bounded treewidth. Surprisingly,Steiner forestis NP-hard even on graphs of treewidth 3. Therefore, our PTAS for bounded-treewidth graphs needs a nontrivial combination of approximation arguments and dynamic programming on the tree decomposition. We further show thatSteiner forestcan be solved in polynomial time for series-parallel graphs (graphs of treewidth at most two) by a novel combination of dynamic programming and minimum cut computations, completing our thorough complexity study ofSteiner forestin the range of bounded-treewidth graphs, planar graphs, and bounded-genus graphs.
