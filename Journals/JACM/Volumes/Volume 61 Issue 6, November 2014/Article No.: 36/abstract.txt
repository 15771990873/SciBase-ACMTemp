Peer-to-peer systems rely on a scalable overlay network that enables efficient routing between its members. Hypercubic topologies facilitate such operations while each node only needs to connect to a small number of other nodes. In contrast to static communication networks, peer-to-peer networks allow nodes to adapt their neighbor set over time in order to react to join and leave events and failures. This article shows how to maintain such networks in a robust manner. Concretely, we present a distributed and self-stabilizing algorithm that constructs a (slightly extended) skip graph, SKIP&plus;, in polylogarithmic time fromany giveninitial state in which the overlay network is still weakly connected. This is an exponential improvement compared to previously known self-stabilizing algorithms for overlay networks. In addition, our algorithm handles individual joins and leaves locally and efficiently.
