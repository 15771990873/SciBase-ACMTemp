Image sharing is an attractive research subject in computer image techniques and in the information security field. This article presents a novel scheme of image sharing with a (t,n) high-security threshold structure. The scheme can encode secret images intonshadow images in such a way that all the shadow images are in aperfectandideal(t,n) threshold structure, while each shadow image has its own visual content assigned at random. The most common method to implement image sharing is based on interpolation polynomial over the field Fp=&lcub;0, 1, 2,&mldr;,p-1&rcub; [Shamir 1979]. In this article, the authors present a new approach to image sharing and its computation based on algebraic-geometry code over the pixel value field GF(2m).
