It is shown that arithmetic expressions withn≥ 1 variables and constants; operations of addition, multiplication, and division; and any depth of parenthesis nesting can be evaluated in time 4 log2n+ 10(n- 1)/pusingp≥ 1 processors which can independently perform arithmetic operations in unit time. This bound is within a constant factor of the best possible. A sharper result is given for expressions without the division operation, and the question of numerical stability is discussed.
