Previous studies of heuristic search techniques have usually considered situations for which the search space could be represented as a tree, which limits the applicability of the results obtained. Here Kowalski is followed and a more general formulation in terms of derivation graph is offered; the graphs correspond rather naturally to the search problems arising in automatic theoremproving and other areas. We consider a family of search procedures controlled by evaluation functions of a very general sort, having the form Æ’Dgr;(x, Lk), whereLkis that portion of the graph generated thus far by the procedure, and the nodexis a candidate for incorporation intoLk. Completeness and minimality results are obtained for a number of procedures in this family, including methods analogous to those of Moore, Dijkstra, and Pohl.
