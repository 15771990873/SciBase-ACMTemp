In a 1967 publication, D. P. Gaver studied a probabilistic model of a multiprogramming computer system. His results have been utilized recently by a number of authors. However, we have observed that Gaver's results contain inconsistencies. These inconsistencies are discussed in detail and a correction suggested and verified through an independent derivation.
