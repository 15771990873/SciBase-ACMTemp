Some elementary mathematical properties of term matching document retrieval systems are developed. These properties are used as a basis for a new file organization technique. Some of the advantages of this new method are (1) the key-to-address transformation is easily determined; (2) the documentary information is stored only once in the file; (3) the file organization allows the use of various matching functions and thresholds; and (4) the dimensionality of the transform is easily expanded to accommodate various sized data bases.
