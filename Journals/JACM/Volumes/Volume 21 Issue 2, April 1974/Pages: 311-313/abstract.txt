Chebyshev approximation on an interval and closed subsets by a Haar subspace are considered. The closeness of best approximations on subsets to the best approximation on the interval is examined. It is shown that under favorable conditions the difference isO((density of the subset)2), making it unnecessary to use very large finite subsets to get good approximations on the interval.
