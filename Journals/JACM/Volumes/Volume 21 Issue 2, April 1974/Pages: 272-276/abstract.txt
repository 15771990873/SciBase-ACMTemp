The solution of a set ofmlinear equations with a non-Hermitian Toeplitz associated matrix is considered. Presently available fast algorithms solve this set with 4m2“operations” (an “operation” is defined here as a set of one addition and one multiplication). An improved algorithm requiring only 3m2“operations” is presented.
