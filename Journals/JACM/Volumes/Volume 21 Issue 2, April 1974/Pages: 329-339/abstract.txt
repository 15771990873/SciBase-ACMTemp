Considerable effort has been invested in devising and analyzing sequencing rules for multiprogrammed or time-shared systems. A much studied discipline of this kind is the so-called system with feedback to lower priority queues. This discipline contains many parameters, in general, which must be fixed in order to achieve the desired waiting-time performance of the discipline. In this paper the problem of synthesizing a system of the above type is solved, by setting parameter values so that prespecified waiting time criteria are satisfied, assuming Poisson arrival and general service time parameters are known.
