Balancing networks, originally introduced by Aspnes et al.(Proceedings of the 23rd Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, pp. 348-358, May 1991), represent a new class of distributed, low-contention data structures suitable for solving many fundamental multi-processor coordination problems that can be expressed asbalancing problems. In this work, we present a mathematical study of the combinatorial structure of balancing networks, and a variety of its applications.Our study identifies important combinatorialtransfer parametersof balancing networks. In turn, necessary and sufficient combinatorial conditions are established, expressed in terms of transfer parameters, which precisely characterize many important and  well studied classes of balancing networks such ascounting networksandsmoothing networks. We propose these combinatorial conditions to be “balancing analogs” of the well knownZero-One principleholding forsorting networksWithin the combinatorial framework we develop, our first application is in deriving combinatorial conditions, involving the transfer parameters, which precisely delimit the boundary between counting networks and sorting networks.
