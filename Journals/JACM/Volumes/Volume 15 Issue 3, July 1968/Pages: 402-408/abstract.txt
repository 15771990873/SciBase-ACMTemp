The problem to be solved is the computation of the inverse of a modified symmetric matrix if the inverse of the original symmetric matrix is already known. By “modified” it is meant that the two symmetric matrices differ from each other in two symmetric elements or columns and rows. For both cases new identities and ALGOL algorithms are derived.
