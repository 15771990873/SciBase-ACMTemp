As a step toward the solution of the placement problem in engineering design, a procedure has been developed for detecting intersections of convex regions in 3-space by means of a pseudocharacteristic function. The mathematical techniques underlying the procedure are discussed, and a system of programs embodying these techniques is described. As a special case a solution is given for the hidden-line problem in graphic display.
