An algorithm is described that will recognize, and fully analyze, strings of unbounded length, using the rewriting rules of any context-free grammar. It uses a finite random access store, three pushdown tapes, and a counter. It imposes no restrictions on the grammar defined by the rewriting rules, excepting only that it be a context-free phrase structure grammar. The analysis printed out is a linearized form of the structural description tree (or trees, in an ambiguous case) of the input string. A proof that the analyzer will always stop in a finite time is provided. The upper bound on the running time increases exponentially with input string length.
