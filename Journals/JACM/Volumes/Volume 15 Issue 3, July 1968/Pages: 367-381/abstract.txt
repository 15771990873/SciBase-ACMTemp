A refinement of the resolution method for mechanical theorem proving is presented. A resolventCof clausesAandBis called amergeif literals fromAandBmerge together to form some literal ofC. It is shown that the resolution method remains complete if it is required that two noninitial clauses which are not merges never be resolved with one another. It is also shown that this strategy can be combined with the set-of-support strategy.
