It is shown that if a languageLis recognized by a (nondeterministic) single-tape Turing machine of time complexityT(n), thenLis recognized by a (nondeterministic) offline Turing machine of tape complexityT1/2(n). IfT(n) ≥n2;,Lis recognized by a (nondeterministic) single-tape Turing machine of tape complexityT1/2(n). If a languageLis recognized by a (nondeterministic) offline Turing machine of time complexity (T(n), thenLis recognized by a (nondeterministic) offline Turing machine of tape complexity (T(n) logn)1/2and by a (nondeterministic) single-tape Turing machine of that tape complexity ifT(n) ≥n2/logn.
