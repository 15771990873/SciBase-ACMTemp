A transduction is a mapping from one set of sequences to another. A syntax-directed transduction is a particular type of transduction which is defined on the grammar of a context-free language and which is meant to be a model of part of the translation process used in many compilers. The transduction is considered from an automata theory viewpoint as specifying the input-output relation of a machine. Special consideration is given to machines called translators which both transduce and recognize. In particular, some special conditions are investigated under which syntax-directed translations can be performed on (deterministic) pushdown machines. In addition, some time bounds for translations on Turing machines are derived.
