Gödel Incompleteness Theorem leaves open a way around it, vaguely perceived for a long time but not clearly identified. (Thus, Gödel believed informal arguments can answer any math question.) Closing this loophole does not seem obvious and involves Kolmogorov complexity. (This is unrelated to, well studied before, complexity quantifications of the usual Gödel effects.) I consider extensionsUof the universal partial recursive predicate (or, say, Peano Arithmetic). I prove that anyUeither leaves ann-bit input (statement) unresolved or contains nearly all information about then-bit prefix of any r.e. real ρ (which isnbits for some ρ). I argue that creating significant information about aspecificmath sequence is impossible regardless of the methods used. Similar problems and answers apply to other unsolvability results for tasks allowing multiple solutions, for example, nonrecursive tilings.
