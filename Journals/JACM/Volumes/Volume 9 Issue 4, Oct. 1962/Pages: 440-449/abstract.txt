The use of iterative procedures for interpolation is well-known. In this paper an iterative procedure, that may be used to compute values of derivatives and definite integrals, is derived. The procedure may also be used to compute the result of applying any linear operator to a function. The data used are a set of point values, at any reasonable set of abscissae. Within certain limitations, values of the derivatives may also be used. Worked examples are given to demonstrate the use of the procedure in three simple problems.
