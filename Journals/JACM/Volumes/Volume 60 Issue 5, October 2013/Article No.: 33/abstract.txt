We study the problem of identity testing for depth-3 circuits of top faninkand degreed. We give a new structure theorem for such identities that improves the known deterministicdkO(k)-time blackbox identity test over rationals [Kayal and Saraf, 2009] to one that takesdO(k2)-time. Our structure theorem essentially says that the number of independent variables in a real depth-3 identity is very small. This theorem affirmatively settles the strong rank conjecture posed by Dvir and Shpilka [2006].We devise various algebraic tools to study depth-3 identities, and use these tools to show that any depth-3 identity contains a much smallernucleus identitythat contains most of the “complexity” of the main identity. The special properties of this nucleus allow us to get near optimal rank bounds for depth-3 identities. The most important aspect of this work is relating a field-dependent quantity, theSylvester-Gallai rank bound, to the rank of depth-3 identities. We also prove a high-dimensional Sylvester-Gallai theorem for all fields, and get a general depth-3 identity rank bound (slightly improving previous bounds).
