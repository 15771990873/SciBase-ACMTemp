The Counting Constraint Satisfaction Problem (&num;CSP(H)) over a finite relational structure H can be expressed as follows: given a relational structure G over the same vocabulary, determine the number of homomorphisms from G to H. In this article we characterize relational structures H for which (&num;CSP(H) can be solved in polynomial time and prove that for all other structures the problem is &num;P-complete.
