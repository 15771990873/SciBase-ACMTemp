We consider the problem of computing the rank of anm×nmatrixAover a field. We present a randomized algorithm to find a set ofr= rank(A) linearly independent columns inÕ(&verbar;A&verbar; &plus;rω) field operations, where &verbar;A&verbar; denotes the number of nonzero entries inAand ω < 2.38 is the matrix multiplication exponent. Previously the best known algorithm to find a set ofrlinearly independent columns is by Gaussian elimination, with deterministic running timeO(mnrω-2). Our algorithm is faster whenr< max&lcub;m,n&rcub;, for instance when the matrix is rectangular. We also consider the problem of computing the rank of a matrix dynamically, supporting the operations of rank one updates and additions and deletions of rows and columns. We present an algorithm that updates the rank inÕ(mn) field operations. We show that these algorithms can be used to obtain faster algorithms for various problems in exact linear algebra, combinatorial optimization and dynamic data structure.
