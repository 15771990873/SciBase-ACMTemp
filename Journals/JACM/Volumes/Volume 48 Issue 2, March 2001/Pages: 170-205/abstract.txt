This paper presents new theorems to analyze divide-and-conquer recurrences, which improve other similar ones in several aspects. In particular, these theorems provide more information, free us almost completely from technicalities like floors and ceilings, and cover a wider set of toll functions and weight distributions, stochastic recurrences included.
