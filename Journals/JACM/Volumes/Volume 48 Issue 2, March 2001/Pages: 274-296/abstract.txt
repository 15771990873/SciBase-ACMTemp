We present approximation algorithms for the metric uncapacitated facility location problem and the metrick-median problem achieving guarantees of 3 and 6 respectively. The distinguishing feature of our algorithms is their low running time:O(mlogm) andO(mlogm(L+ log (n))) respectively, wherenandmare the total number of vertices and edges in the underlying complete bipartite graph on cities and facilities. The main algorithmic ideas are a new extension of the primal-dual schema and the use of Lagrangian relaxation to derive approximation algorithms.
