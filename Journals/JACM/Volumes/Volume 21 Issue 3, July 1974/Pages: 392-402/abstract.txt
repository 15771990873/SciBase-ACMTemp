This paper deals with a combinatorial minimization problem arising from studies on multimodule memory organizations. Instead of searching for an optimum solution, a particular solution is proposed and it is demonstrated that it is close to optimum. Lower bounds for the objective functions are obtained and compared with the corresponding values of the particular solution. The maximum percentage deviation of this solution from optimum is also established.
