The amount of store necessary to operate a dynamic storage allocation system, subject to certain constraints, with no risk of breakdown due to storage fragmentation, is considered. Upper and lower bounds are given for this amount of store, both of them stronger than those established earlier. The lower bound is the exact solution of a related problem concerning allocation of blocks whose size is always a power of 2.
