The set covering problem is considered and an efficient procedure for finding an irredundant cover is presented. For anm√óncover table, the execution time of the procedure is, in the worst case, proportional tomn. Methods are suggested for obtaining alternate irredundant covers based on an initially obtained irredundant cover. The basic cost-independent algorithm is heuristically extended to consider costs so that a reduced-cost irredundant cover can be obtained. A summary of some computational experience is presented, which indicates that the procedure is fast and applicable to large problems.
