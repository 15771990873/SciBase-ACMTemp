An attempt is made to apply information-theoretic computational complexity to meta-mathematics. The paper studies the number of bits of instructions that must be given to a computer for it to perform finite and infinite tasks, and also the time it takes the computer to perform these tasks. This is applied to measuring the difficulty of proving a given set of theorems, in terms of the number of bits of axioms that are assumed, and the size of the proofs needed to deduce the theorems from the axioms.
