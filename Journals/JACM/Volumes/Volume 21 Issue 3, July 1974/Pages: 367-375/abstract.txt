It is established that ifGis a reducible flow graph, then edge (n, m) is backward (a back latch) if and only if eithern = mormdominatesninG. Thus, the backward edges of a reducible flow graph are unique.Further characterizations of reducibility are presented. In particular, the following are equivalent: (a)G= (N, E, n0) is reducible. (b) The “dag” ofGis unique. (A dag of a flow graphGis a maximal acyclic flow graph which is a subgraph ofG.) (c)Ecan be partitioned into two setsE1andE2such thatE1forms a dagDofGand each (n, m) inE2hasn = mormdominatesninG. (d) Same as (c), except each (n, m) inE2hasn = mormdominatesninD. (e) Same as (c), exceptE2is the back edge set of a depth-first spanning tree forG. (f) Every cycle ofGhas a node which dominates the other nodes of the cycle.Finally, it is shown that there is a “natural” single-entry loop associated with each backward edge of a reducible flow graph.
