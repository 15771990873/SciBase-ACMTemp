The problem of computing a desired function value to within a prescribed tolerance can be formulated in the following two distinct ways:FormulationI: Given x and ∈ > 0, computef(x) to within ∈.FormulationII: Given only that x is in a closed interval X, compute a subinterval of the image,f(X) = {f(x) : x ∈ X}. The first formulation is applicable when x is known to arbitrary accuracy. The second formulation is applicable when x is known only to a limited accuracy, in which case the tolerance is prescribed albeit indirectly by the interval X, and one must be satisfied with all or part of the setf(X) of possible function values.Elsewhere the author has presented an efficient solution to Formulation I for any rationalfand many nonrationalf. B. A. Chartres has presented an efficient solution to Formulation II for a very restricted class of rationalfand for a few nonrationalf.In this paper a solution to Formulation II for the arbitrary nonconstant rationalfis presented. By boundingdf/dxaway from zero over some subset of X, it is shown how to reduce Formulation II to Formulation I, yielding the solution given here.In generalizing to vector-valued functions f, Chartres has solved Formulation II only for rational f which satisfy a linear system of equations, while this paper presents a solution for arbitrary non-degenerate rational vector-valued f.
