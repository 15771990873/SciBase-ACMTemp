We present a fully dynamic randomized data structure that can answer queries about the convex hull of a set ofnpoints in three dimensions, where insertions takeO(log3n) expected amortized time, deletions takeO(log6n) expected amortized time, and extreme-point queries takeO(log2n) worst-case time. This is the first method that guarantees polylogarithmic update and query cost for arbitrary sequences of insertions and deletions, and improves the previousO(n&epsis;)-time method by Agarwal and Matou≈°ek a decade ago. As a consequence, we obtain similar results for nearest neighbor queries in two dimensions and improved results for numerous fundamental geometric problems (such as levels in three dimensions and dynamic Euclidean minimum spanning trees in the plane).
