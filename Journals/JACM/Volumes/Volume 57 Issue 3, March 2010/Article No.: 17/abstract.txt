We present several new results regarding λs(n), the maximum length of a Davenport--Schinzel sequence of ordersonndistinct symbols.First, we prove that λs(n) &leq;n⋅ 2(1/t&excel;)α(n)t+O(α(n)t−1)fors&geq; 4 even, and λs(n) &leq;n⋅ 2(1/t&excel;)α(n)tlog2α(n) +O(α(n)t)fors&geq; 3 odd, wheret&equals; ⌊(s−2)/2⌋, and α(n) denotes the inverse Ackermann function. The previous upper bounds, by Agarwal et al. &lsqb;1989&rsqb;, had a leading coefficient of 1 instead of 1/t&excel; in the exponent. The bounds for evensare now tight up to lower-order terms in the exponent. These new bounds result from a small improvement on the technique of Agarwal et al.More importantly, we also present a new technique for deriving upper bounds for λs(n). This new technique is very similar to the one we applied to the problem of stabbing interval chains &lsqb;Alon et al. 2008&rsqb;. With this new technique we: (1) re-derive the upper bound of λ3(n) &leq; 2nα(n) +O(n&sqrt;α(n)) (first shown by Klazar &lsqb;1999&rsqb;); (2) re-derive our own new upper bounds for generalsand (3) obtain improved upper bounds for the generalized Davenport--Schinzel sequences considered by Adamec et al. &lsqb;1992&rsqb;.Regarding lower bounds, we show that λ3(n) &geq; 2nα(n) −O(n) (the previous lower bound (Sharir and Agarwal, 1995) had a coefficient of 1/2), so the coefficient 2 is tight. We also present a simpler variant of the construction of Agarwal et al. &lsqb;1989&rsqb; that achieves the known lower bounds of λs(n) &geq;n⋅ 2(1/t&excel;) α(n)t−O(α(n)t−1)fors&geq; 4 even.
