We present a new method for upper bounding the second eigenvalue of the Laplacian of graphs. Our approach uses multi-commodity flows to deform the geometry of the graph; we embed the resulting metric into Euclidean space to recover a bound on the Rayleigh quotient. Using this, we show that everyn-vertex graph of genusgand maximum degreeDsatisfies λ2(G)&equals;O((g+1)3D/n). This recovers theO(D/n) bound of Spielman and Teng for planar graphs, and compares to Kelner's bound ofO((g+1)poly(D)/n), but our proof does not make use of conformal mappings or circle packings. We are thus able to extend this to resolve positively a conjecture of Spielman and Teng, by proving that λ2(G) &equals;O(Dh6logh/n) wheneverGisKh-minor free. This shows, in particular, that spectral partitioning can be used to recoverO(&sqrt;n)-sized separators in bounded degree graphs that exclude a fixed minor. We extend this further by obtaining nearly optimal bounds on λ2for graphs that exclude small-depth minors in the sense of Plotkin, Rao, and Smith. Consequently, we show that spectral algorithms find separators of sublinear size in a general class of geometric graphs.Moreover, while the standard “sweep” algorithm applied to the second eigenvector may fail to find good quotient cuts in graphs of unbounded degree, our approach produces a vector that works forarbitrarygraphs. This yields an alternate proof of the well-known nonplanar separator theorem of Alon, Seymour, and Thomas that states that every excluded-minor family of graphs hasO(&sqrt;n)-node balanced separators.
