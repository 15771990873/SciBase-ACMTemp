We observe that many important computational problems in NC1share a simple self-reducibility property. We then show that, for any problemAhaving this self-reducibility property,Ahas polynomial-size TC0circuits if and only if it has TC0circuits of sizen1+&epsis;for every &epsis;> 0 (counting the number of wires in a circuit as the size of the circuit). As an example of what this observation yields, consider the Boolean Formula Evaluation problem (BFE), which is complete for NC1and has the self-reducibility property. It follows from a lower bound of Impagliazzo, Paturi, and Saks, that BFE requires depthdTC0circuits of sizen1+&epsis;d. If one were able to improve this lower bound to show that there is some constant &epsis;> 0 (independent of the depthd) such that every TC0circuit family recognizing BFE has size at leastn1+&epsis;, then it would follow that TC0≠ NC1. We show that proving lower bounds of the formn1+&epsis;is not ruled out by the Natural Proof framework of Razborov and Rudich and hence there is currently no known barrier for separating classes such as ACC0, TC0and NC1via existing “natural” approaches to proving circuit lower bounds.We also show that problems with small uniform constant-depth circuits have algorithms that simultaneously have small space and time bounds. We then make use of known time-space tradeoff lower bounds to show that SAT requires uniform depthdTC0and AC0&lsqb;6&rsqb; circuits of sizen1+cfor some constantcdepending ond.
