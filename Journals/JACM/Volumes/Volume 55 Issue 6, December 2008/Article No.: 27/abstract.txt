Given a set of demands in a directed graph, thedirected congestion minimizationproblem is to route every demand with the objective of minimizing the heaviest load over all edges. We show that for any constant &epsiv; > 0, there is no Ω(log1−&epsiv;M)-approximation algorithm on networks of sizeMunlessNP⊆ZPTIME(npolylogn). This bound is almost tight given theO(logM/log logM)-approximation via randomized rounding due to Raghavan and Thompson.
