We show two new direct product results in two different models of communication complexity. Our first result is in the one-way public-coin model. Letf ⊆ X × Y × Zbe a relation and &epsi; > 0 be a constant. Let R1,pub&epsi;(f) represent the communication complexity off, with worst-case error &epsi; in this model. We show that if for computingfk(kindependent copies off) in this model,o(k&cdot; R1, pub1/3(f)) communication is used, then the success is exponentially small ink. We show a new tight characterization of communication complexity in this model which strengthens the tight characterization shown in Jain et al. [2008]. We use this new characterization to show our direct product result and this characterization may also be of independent interest.Our second direct product result is in the model of two-way public-coin communication complexity. We show a direct product result for all relations in this model in terms of a new complexity measure that we define. Our new measure is a generalization to nonproduct distributions, of the two-way product subdistribution bound of Jain et al. [2008]. Our direct product result therefore generalizes to nonproduct distributions, their direct product result in terms of the two-way product subdistribution bound. As an application of our new direct product result, we reproduce (via completely different arguments) strong direct product result for the set-disjointness problem which was previously shown by Klauck [2010]. We show this by proving that our new complexity measure gives a tight lower bound of Ω(n) for the set-disjointness problem onn-bit inputs (this strengthens the linear lower bound on the rectangle/corruption bound for set-disjointness shown by Razborov [1992]). In addition, we show that many previously known direct product results in this model are uniformly implied and often strengthened by our result.
