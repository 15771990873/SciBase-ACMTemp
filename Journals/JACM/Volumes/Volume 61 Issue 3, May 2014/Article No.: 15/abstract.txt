The computation of the winning set for Büchi objectives in alternating games on graphs is a central problem in computer-aided verification with a large number of applications. The long-standing best known upper bound for solving the problem isÕ(n⋅m), wherenis the number of vertices andmis the number of edges in the graph. We are the first to break theÕ(n⋅m) boundary by presenting a new technique that reduces the running time toO(n2). This bound also leads toO(n2)-time algorithms for computing the set of almost-sure winning vertices for Büchi objectives (1) in alternating games with probabilistic transitions (improving an earlier bound ofÕ(n⋅m)), (2) in concurrent graph games with constant actions (improving an earlier bound ofO(n3)), and (3) in Markov decision processes (improving form>n4/3an earlier bound ofO(m⋅ √m)). We then show how to maintain the winning set for Büchi objectives in alternating games under a sequence of edge insertions or a sequence of edge deletions inO(n) amortized time per operation. Our algorithms are the first dynamic algorithms for this problem. We then consider another core graph theoretic problem in verification of probabilistic systems, namely computing the maximal end-component decomposition of a graph. We present two improved static algorithms for the maximal end-component decomposition problem. Our first algorithm is anO(m⋅ √m)-time algorithm, and our second algorithm is anO(n2)-time algorithm which is obtained using the same technique as for alternating Büchi games. Thus, we obtain anO(min &lcu;m ⋅ √m,n2&rcub;)-time algorithm improving the long-standingO(n⋅m) time bound. Finally, we show how to maintain the maximal end-component decomposition of a graph under a sequence of edge insertions or a sequence of edge deletions inO(n) amortized time per edge deletion, andO(m) worst-case time per edge insertion. Again, our algorithms are the first dynamic algorithms for this problem.
