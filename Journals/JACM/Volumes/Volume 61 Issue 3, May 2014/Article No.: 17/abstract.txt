Given topological spacesX,Y, a fundamental problem of algebraic topology is understanding the structure of all continuous mapsX→Y. We consider a computational version, whereX,Yare given as finite simplicial complexes, and the goal is to compute [X,Y], that is, all homotopy classes of such maps. We solve this problem in thestable range, where for somed≥ 2, we have dimX≤ 2d−2 andYis (d-1)-connected; in particular,Ycan be thed-dimensional sphereSd. The algorithm combines classical tools and ideas from homotopy theory (obstruction theory, Postnikov systems, and simplicial sets) with algorithmic tools from effective algebraic topology (locally effective simplicial sets and objects with effective homology). In contrast, [X,Y] is known to be uncomputable for generalX,Y, since forX&equals;S1it includes a well known undecidable problem: testing triviality of the fundamental group ofY.In follow-up papers, the algorithm is shown to run in polynomial time fordfixed, and extended to other problems, such as theextension problem, where we are given a subspaceA⊂Xand a mapA→Yand ask whether it extends to a mapX→Y, or computing the &integers;2-index—everything in the stable range. Outside the stable range, the extension problem is undecidable.
