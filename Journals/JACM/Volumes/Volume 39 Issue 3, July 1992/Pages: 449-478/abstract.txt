A high-level, knowledge-based approach for deriving a family of protocols for thesequence transmissionproblem is presented. The protocols of Aho et al. [2, 3], the Alternating Bit protocol [5], and Stenning's protocol [44] are all instances of one knowledge-based protocol that is derived. The derivation in this paper leads to transparent and uniform correctness proofs for all these protocols.
