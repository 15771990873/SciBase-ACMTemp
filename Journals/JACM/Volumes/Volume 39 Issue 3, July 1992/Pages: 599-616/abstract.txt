The problem of testing membership in aperiodic or “group-free” transformation monoids is the natural counterpart to the well-studied membership problem in permutation groups. The classAof all finite aperiodic monoids and the classGof all finite groups are two examples ofvarieties, the fundamental complexity units in terms of which finite monoids are classified. The collection of all varietiesVforms an infinite lattice under the inclusion ordering, with the subfamily of varieties that are contained inAforming an infinite sublattice. For eachV⊆A, the associated problem MEMB(V) of testing membership in transformation monoids that belong toV,   is considered. Remarkably, the computational complexity of each such problem turns out to look familiar. Moreover, only five possibilities occur asVranges over the whole aperiodic sublattice: With one family of NP-hard exceptions whose exact status is still unresolved, any such MEMB(V) is either PSPACE-complete, NP-complete, P-complete or in AC0. These results thus uncover yet another surprisingly tight link between the theory of monoids and computational complexity theory.
