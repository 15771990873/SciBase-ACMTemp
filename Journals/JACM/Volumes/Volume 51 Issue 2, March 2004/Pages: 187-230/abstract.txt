We study the security of individual bits in an RSA encrypted messageEN(x). We show that givenEN(x), predicting any single bit inxwith only a nonnegligible advantage over the trivial guessing strategy, is (through a polynomial-time reduction) as hard as breaking RSA. Moreover, we prove that blocks ofO(log logN) bits ofxare computationally indistinguishable from random bits. The results carry over to the Rabin encryption scheme.Considering the discrete exponentiation functiongxmodulop, with probability 1 âˆ’o(1) over random choices of the primep, the analog results are demonstrated. The results do not rely on group representation, and therefore applies to general cyclic groups as well. Finally, we prove that the bits ofax+bmodulopgive hard core predicates for any one-way functionf.All our results follow from a general result on thechosen multiplier hidden number problem:given an integerN, and access to an algorithmPxthat on input a randoma&in; ZN, returns a guess of theith bit ofaxmodN, recoverx. We show that for anyi, if Pxhas at least a nonnegligible advantage in predicting theith bit, we either recoverx, or, obtain a nontrivial factor ofNin polynomial time. The result also extends to prove the results about simultaneous security of blocks ofO(log logN) bits.
