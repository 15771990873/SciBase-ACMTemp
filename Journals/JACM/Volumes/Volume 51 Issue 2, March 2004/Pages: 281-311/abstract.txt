A descriptive complexity approach to random 3-SAT is initiated. We show that unsatisfiability of any significant fraction of random 3-CNF formulas cannot be certified by any property that is expressible in Datalog. Combined with the known relationship between the complexity of constraint satisfaction problems and expressibility in Datalog, our result implies that any constraint propagation algorithm working with small constraints will fail to certify unsatisfiability almost always. Our result is a consequence of designing a winning strategy for one of the players in the existential pebble game. The winning strategy makes use of certain extension axioms that we introduce and hold almost surely on a random 3-CNF formula. The second contribution of our work is the connection between finite model theory and propositional proof complexity. To make this connection explicit, we establish a tight relationship between the number of pebbles needed to win the game and the width of the Resolution refutations. As a consequence to our result and the known size--width relationship in Resolution, we obtain new proofs of the exponential lower bounds for Resolution refutations of random 3-CNF formulas and the Pigeonhole Principle.
