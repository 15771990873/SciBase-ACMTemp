We describe efficient constructions for various cryptographic primitives in private-key as well as public-key cryptography. Our main results are two new constructions of pseudo-random functions. We prove the pseudo-randomness of one construction under the assumption thatfactoring(Blum integers) is hard while the other construction is pseudo-random if thedecisional version of the Diffie--Hellmanassumption holds. Computing the value of our functions at any given point involves two subset products. This is much more efficient than previous proposals. Furthermore, these functions have the advantage of being inTC0(the class of functions computable by constant depth circuits consisting of a polynomial number of threshold gates). This fact has several interesting applications. The simple algebraic structure of the functions implies additional features such as a zero-knowledge proof for statements of the form "y&equals;fs(x)" and "y&neq;fs(x)" given a commitment to a keysof a pseudo-random functionfs.
