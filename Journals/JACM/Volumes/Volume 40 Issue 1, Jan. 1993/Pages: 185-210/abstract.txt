A read-once formula is a Boolean formula in which each variable occurs, at most, once. Such formulas are also called &mgr;-formulas or Boolean trees. This paper treats the problem of exactly identifying an unknown read-once formula using specific kinds of queries.The main results are a polynomial-time algorithm for exact identification of monotone read-once formulas using only membership queries, and a polynomial-time algorithm for exact identification of general read-once formulas using equivalence and membership queries (a protocol based on the notion of aminimally adequate teacher[1]). The results of the authors improve on Valiant's previous results for read-once formulas [26]. It is also shown, that no polynomial-time algorithm using only membership queries or only equivalence queries can exactly identify all read-once formulas.
