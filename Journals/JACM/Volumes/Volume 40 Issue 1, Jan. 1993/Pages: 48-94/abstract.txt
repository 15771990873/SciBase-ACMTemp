Consider the problem of generating bitmaps from character shapes given as outlines. The obvious scan-conversion process does not produce acceptable results unless important features such as stem widths are carefully controlled during the scan-conversion process. This paper describes a method for automatically extracting the necessary feature information and generating high-quality bitmaps without resorting to hand editing. Almost all of the work is done in a preprocessing step, the result of which is an intermediate form that can be quickly converted into bitmaps once the font size and device resolution are known.A heuristically defined system of linear equations describes how the ideal outlines should be distorted in order to produce the best possible results when scan converted in a straightforward manner. The LovaÂ´sz basis reduction algorithm then reduces the system of equations to a form that makes it easy to find an approximate solution subject to the constraint that some variables must be integers.The heuristic information is of such a general nature that it applies equally well to Roman fonts and Japanese Kanji.
