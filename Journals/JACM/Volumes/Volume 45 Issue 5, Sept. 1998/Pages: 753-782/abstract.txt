We present a polynomial time approximation scheme for Euclidean TSP in fixed dimensions. For every fixedc> 1 and given anynnodes inR2, a randomized version of the scheme finds a (1 + 1/c)-approximation to the optimum traveling salesman tour inO(n(logn)O(c))time. When the nodes are inRd, the running time increases toO(n(logn)(O(dc))d-1). For every fixedc,    dthe running time isn• poly(logn), that isnearly linearinn. The algorithmm can be derandomized, but this increases the running time by  a  factorO(nd). The previous best approximation algorithm for the problem (due to Christofides) achieves a 3/2-aproximation in polynomial time.We also give similar approximation schemes for some other NP-hard Euclidean problems: Minimum Steiner Tree,k-TSP, andk-MST. (The running times of the algorithm fork-TSP andk-MST involve an additional multiplicative factork.) The previous best approximation algorithms for all these problems    achieved a constant-factor approximation. We also give efficient approximation schemes for Euclidean Min-Cost Matching, a problem that can be solved exactly in polynomial time.All our algorithms also work, with almost no modification, when distance is measured using any geometric norm (such as&ell;pforp≥ 1 or other Minkowski norms). They also have simple parallel (i.e., NC) implementations.
