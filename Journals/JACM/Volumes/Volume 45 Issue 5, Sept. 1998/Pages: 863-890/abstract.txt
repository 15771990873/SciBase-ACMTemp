We present an efficient algorithm for PAC-learning a very general class of geometric concepts overRdfor fixedd. More specifically, letTbe any set ofshalfspaces. Letx=(x1, …,xd) be an arbitrary point inRd. With eacht∈Twe associate a boolean indicator functionIt(x)which is 1 if and only ifxis in the halfspacet. The  concept class,Cds, that we study consists of all  concepts formed by any Boolean function overIt1, …, Itsforti∈T. This class is much more general than any geometric concept class known to be PAC-learnable. Our results can be extended easily to learn efficiently any Boolean combination of a polynomial number of concepts selected from any concept classCoverRgiven that the VC-dimension ofChas dependence only ondand there is a polynomial time algorithm to determine if there is a concept fromCconsistent with a given set of labeled examples. We also present a statistical query version of our algorithm that can tolerate random classification noise. Finally we present a generalization of the  standard &egr;-net result of Haussler and Welzl [1987] and apply it to give an alternative noise-tolerant algorithm ford= 2 based on geometric subdivisions.
