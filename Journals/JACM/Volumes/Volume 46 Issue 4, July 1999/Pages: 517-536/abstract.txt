We introduce a search problem called “mutual search” wherekagents, arbitrarily distributed overnsites, are required to locate one another by posing queries of the form “Anybody at sitei?”. We ask for the least number of queries that is necessary and sufficient. For the case of two agents using deterministic protocols, we obtain the following worst-case results: In an oblivious setting (where all pre-planned queries are executed), there is no savings:n−1 queries are required and are sufficient. In a nonoblivious setting, we can exploit the paradigm of “no news is also news” to obtain significant savings: in the synchronous case 0.586nqueries are    required; in the asynchronous case  0.896nqueries suffice and a fortiori  0.536nqueries are required; foronagents using a synchronous deterministic protocol less thannqueries suffice; there is a simple randomized protocol for two agents with worst-case expected 0.5nqueries and all radomized protocols require at least 0.25nworst-case expected queries. The graph-theoretic framework we formulate for expressing and analyzing algorithms for this problem may be of independent interest.
