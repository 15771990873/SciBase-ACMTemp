This paper solves a longstanding open problem in fully dynamic algorithms: We present the first fully dynamic algorithms that maintain connectivity, bipartiteness, and approximate minimum spanning trees in polylogarithmic time per edge insertion or deletion. The algorithms are designed using a new dynamic technique that combines a novel graph decomposition with randomization. They are Las-Vegas type randomized algorithms which use simple data structures and have a small constant factor.Letndenote the number of nodes in the graph. For a sequence of &OHgr;(m0) operations, wherem0is the number of edges in the initial graph, the expected time forpupdates isO(plog3n) (througout the paper the logarithms are based 2) for connectivity and bipartiteness. The worst-case time for one query isO(logn/log logn). For thek-edge witness problem (“Does the removal ofkgiven edges disconnect the graph?”) the expected time forpupdates isO(plog3n) and the expected time forqqueries isO(qklog3n). Given a graph withkdifferent weights, the minimum spanning tree can be maintained during   a   sequence ofpupdates in expected timeO(pklog3n). This implies an algorithm to maintain a 1 + &egr;-approximation of the minimum spanning tree 
in expected timeO((plog3nlogU)/&egr;) forpupdates, where the weights of the edges are between 1 andU.
