It is known that if P and NP are different then there is an infinite hierarchy of different complexity classes that lie strictly between them. Thus, if P ≠ NP, it is not possible to classify NP using any finite collection of complexity classes. This situation has led to attempts to identify smaller classes of problems within NP wheredichotomyresults may hold: every problem is either in P or is NP-complete. A similar situation exists forcountingproblems. If P ≠&num;P, there is an infinite hierarchy in between and it is important to identify subclasses of &num;P where dichotomy results hold. Graph homomorphism problems are a fertile setting in which to explore dichotomy theorems. Indeed, Feder and Vardi have shown that a dichotomy theorem for the problem of deciding whether there is a homomorphism to a fixed directed acyclic graph would resolve their long-standing dichotomy conjecture for all constraint satisfaction problems. In this article, we give a dichotomy theorem for the problem of counting homomorphisms to directed acyclic graphs. LetHbe a fixed directed acyclic graph. The problem is, given an input digraphG, determine how many homomorphisms there are fromGtoH. We give a graph-theoretic classification, showing that for some digraphsH, the problem is in P and for the rest of the digraphsHthe problem is &num;P-complete. An interesting feature of the dichotomy, which is absent from previously known dichotomy results, is that there is a rich supply of tractable graphsHwith complex structure.
