Nancy Lynch proved that if a decision problemAis not solvable in polynomial time, then there exists an infinite recursive subsetXof its domain on which the decision is almost everywhere complex. In this paper, general theorems of this kind that can be applied to several well-known automata-based complexity classes, including a common class of randomized algorithms, are proved.
