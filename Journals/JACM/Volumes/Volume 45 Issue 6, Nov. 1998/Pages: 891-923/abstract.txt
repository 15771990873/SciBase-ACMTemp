Consider a set ofSofndata points  in reald-dimensional space, Rd, where distances are measured using any Minkowski metric. In nearest neighbor searching, we preprocessSinto a data structure, so that given any query pointq∈Rd, is the closest point of S toqcan be reported quickly. Given any positive real &egr;, data pointpis a (1 +&egr;)-approximate nearest neighborofqif its distance fromqis within a factor of (1 + &egr;) of the distance to the true nearest neighbor. We show that it is possible to preprocess a    set ofnpoints in     RdinO(dnlogn) time andO(dn)space, so that given a query pointq∈Rd, and &egr; > 0, a (1 + &egr;)-approximate nearest neighbor ofqcan be computed inO(cd, &egr;logn) time, wherecd,&egr;≤d1 + 6d/e;dis a factor depending only on dimension and &egr;. In general, we show that given an integerk≥ 1, (1 + &egr;)-approximations  to theknearest neighbors ofqcan  be computed in additionalO(kdlogn) time.
