A class of parallel algorithms for evaluating game trees is presented. These algorithms parallelize a standard sequential algorithm for evaluating AND/OR trees and the &agr;-&bgr; pruning procedure for evaluating MIN/MAX trees. It is shown that, uniformly on all instances of uniform AND/OR trees, the parallel AND/OR tree algorithm achieves an asymptotic linear speedup using a polynomial number of processors in the height of the tree. The analysis of linear speedup using more than a linear number of processors is due to J. Harting. A numerical lower bound rigorously establishes a good speedup for the uniform AND/OR trees with parameters that are typical in practice. The performance of the parallel &agr;-&bgr; algorithm on best-ordered MIN/MAX trees is analyzed.
