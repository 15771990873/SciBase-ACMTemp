A new method of checking the consistency of precedence matrices is demonstrated. The method is based on the theorem that a precedence matrix is consistent if and only if every principal submatrix has at least one zero row or zero column. Because this method recognizes inconsistencies in their implicit form whereas the conventional method recognized only explicit contradictions, a considerable saving in time and effort can be effected, since the process of making explicit all the implications of a precedence matrix particularly a larger one, is a tedious time-consuming operation.
