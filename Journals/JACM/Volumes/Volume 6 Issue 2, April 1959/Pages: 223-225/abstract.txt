In [1] Ward described the “downhill” method for determining roots off(z) = 0, whqeref(z) is analytic. He denoted byR(x, y) andJ(x, y) the real and imaginary parts, respectively, off(z) and defined the surfaceWby (1)W(x, y) = |R(x, y) | + |J(x, y) |. He proved thatW(x, y) is a minimum if and only ifx+iyis a zero of ƒ(z), i.e.,Wis a minimum if and only ifW= 0.The application of this method to the solution off(z) = 0 is conceptually simple in view of the results in [1]. A starting value,x0+iy0, is chosen (at random, if it is desired so), and the correspondingW(x0,y0) is computed. IfW(x0,y0) > 0, new values ofxandy,x1=x0+h1,y1=y0+k1, are chosen, theh1andk1being subject only to the restriction thatW(x1,y1) <W(x0,y0). Therefore, the actual problem consists of determining suitable values ofh1andk1. It is the purpose of this note to indicate a method for the determination of these increments.Let (2) ƒ(z) =c0+ ∑∞j=pcj(z-z)jbe analytic in whatever region aboutzis being considered. It is assumed thatc0≠ 0, thatcp≠ 0, and thep≥ 1. Thecjare complex numbers. Although the final result will be given in rectangular coordinates, it is easier to work here with the polar form.Accordingly, letcj=&agr;jei
