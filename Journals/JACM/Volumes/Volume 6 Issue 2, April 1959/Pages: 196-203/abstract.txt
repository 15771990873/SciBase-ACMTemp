In 1926 Milne [1] published a numerical method for the solution of ordinary differential equations. This method turns out to be unstable, as shown by Muhin [2], Hildebrand [3], Liniger [4], and others. Instability was not too serious in the day of desk calculators but is fatal in the modern era of high speed computers. The basic cause of the instability in this particular method is the use of Simpson's rule to perform the final integration. Simpson's rule integrates over two intervals, and under certain conditions can produce an error which alternates in sign from step to step and which increases in magnitude exponentially. It is the purpose of this paper to show that the occasional application of Newton's “three eighths” quadrature formula over three intervals can effectively damp out the unwanted oscillation without harm to the desired solution.Let the given differential equation bedy/dx= ƒ(x, y), and let the step length for the independent variablexbe denoted byh. The quantitys=h∂ƒ/∂yplays a basic role in the analysis, for it may be shown that when Simpson's rule is used an errorE0atx=x0is propagated through subsequent steps according to the second order difference equation (1 -sn+1/3)En+1- (4sn/3)En- (1 +sn-1/3)En-1= 0. (See e.g., Hildebrand [3], p. 206, Milne [5], p. 68.)While in generalsis a variable, the special case wheresis constant not only permits a simple analysis but also serves to explain the behavior in other cases. Cf. Hildebrand [3], p. 202. Accordingly we treatsas a constant and assume that our differential equation isdy/dx=Gy, the general solution of which, afternsteps, isyn=Aens, whereAis an arbitrary constant,s=hG, andx=nh.When Simpson's rule is used, the corresponding difference equation is (1 -s/3)yn+1- (4s/3)yn- (1 +s/3)yn-1= 0, (1) with the general solutionyn=Ar1n+Br2n, (2) in whichr1andr2are the roots of the quadratic equation (1 -s/3)r2- (4s/3)r- (1 +s/3) = 0. From this equation we obtain the derivativedr/ds= (r2+ 4r+ 1)2(12r2+ 12r+ 12)-1, which is never negative. Hence the rootsr1= [2s/3 + (1 +s2/3)1/2] (1 -s/3)-1,r2= [2s/3 - (1 +s2/3)1/2] (1 -s/3)-1, are monotone increasing functions for all real values ofs, except for a discontinuity inr1ats= 3.Moreover, the rootsr1andr2are analytic within a circle of radius 31/2with center at the origin in the complexsplane. Through terms of degree five insthe power series forr1andr2are respectivelyr1= 1 +s+s2/2! +s3/3! +s4/4! +s5/72 + ··· =es+s5/180 + ··· , (3) andr2= -1 +s/3 -s2/18 -s3/54 + 5s4/648 + 5s5/1944 + ··· (4) Obviouslyr1is the desired root andr2is the unwanted root that produces the oscillation.Quite apart from questions of stability the process of numerical integration with Simpson's rule requires that the quantitys/3 must be numerically less than unity and in practical computation should be considerably less than unity. Cf. Milne [5], p. 67. We shall therefore assume that |s| \lt 1. Table I shows to six decimal places the value ofr1andr2forsranging from -1 to +1 at steps of 0.1. It is evident that in this ranger2is numerically less than one ifsis positive, greater than one ifsis negative. Thus the oscillating term increases exponentially withnifGis negative, decreases ifGis positive.Now suppose that afterksteps of the process we recomputeykfrom the values already found, using Newton's “three eighths rule”, to obtainyk*=yk-3+ (3s/8)(yk+ 3yk-1+ 3yk-2+yk-3). Then we replace the originally computedykby the arithmetic meanyk= (yk+yk*)/2. (5) From (2) and (5) we find thatyk=Ark-31K(r1) +Brk-32K(r2), (6) in whichK(r) is defined by the equationK(r) = [r3+ 1 + (3s/8) (r+ 1)3]/2. (7) This functionK(r) is the key to the problem.For by means of the series forr1andr2it can be shown thatK(r1) =r13+s5/96 + ··· (8) whileK(r2) =s/2 -s2/4 + ··· . Hence equation (3) becomesyk=Ar1k+ terms of degree 5 and higher +Brk-32(s/2) + terms of degree 2 and higher. (9) Comparingykwithykwe note that the desired solution is substantially unchanged, and agrees with the true solutioneksthrough terms of degree 4 ins, while the unwanted solution has been decreased roughly by a factor of magnitudes/2.Table I shows to six decimal places the values ofK(r1) andK(r2) in the range froms= -1 tos= +1. It is seen that in this interval the absolute value ofK(r2) is always less than unity.Consider now the propagation of a single error starting atn= 0 and modified after every group ofksteps by means of formula (5). SinceEnis a solution of equation (1), in themth group ofksteps the errorEncan be expressed by formula (2) in the formEn=amr1j+bmr2j, (10) providedn=mk+jandj<k. But ifj=kthe value ofEncan be expressed approximately asEn=amr1k+bmrk-32K(r2). (11) To obtain this result one must replaceK(r1) by its approximate valuer13, as shown in equation (8).Similarly in the (m+ 1)th group of steps we may letEn=am+1r1j+bm+1r2j, wheren= (m+ 1)k+jandj<k. The coefficientsam+1andbm+1are connected to the coefficientsamandbmby the following equations, written in matrix form: (r-11r-121 1)(am+1bm+1) = (rk-11rk-12r1krk-32K(r2))(ambm). One may verify the above statement by noting that both members of the first equation are equal toEmk+k-1and both members of the second equation are equal toEmk+k.Left-hand multiplication by the inverse of the matrix on the left leads to (am+1bm+1) =M(ambm) (12) in whichM= (u v0w), whereu=r1k,v=r2kP,w=r2kQ, andP= - [r1-r1K(r2)r-32] (r1-r2)-1,Q= [r1-r2K(r2)r32] (r1-r2)-1.The quantitiesamandbm, and consequently (by equation (10)) the quantityEnalso, will approach zero asmbecomes infinite provided both latent roots ofM, namelyuandw, are less than one in absolute value. For the case under consideration whereslies between -1 and 0 the value ofuis always less than one, as we see from table I.It remains to examine the other latent rootw=r2kQ. The quantityQis a function ofsalone and its values forsin the interval form -1 to 0 are shown in table II. If we defineqby the equationq= - logQ/log(-r2) (13) it can be shown that forsbetween -1 and 0 and forkan integer less thanqthe latent rootwwill be less than one in absolute value. Hence to assure that the propagated errorEnwill approach zero it is sufficient to choose a value ofkwhich is less thanq. For convenience of computers some values ofqforsbetween -1 and 0 are supplied in table II.It may be noted that the foregoing analysis does not strictly apply ifkis less than 3 since formula (6) on which the reasoning depends was derived with the tacit assumption thatkis not less than 3. Nevertheless machine tests indicate that the convergence forkless than 3 is just about what might be expected on the basis of the above analysis. However, it is unwise for other reasons than stability to use values ofsnumerically greater than 0.8, so that the accuracy of table II in this range is unimportant.To illustrate the foregoing theory several computations were performed on the Alwac III-E at Oregon State College for the systemdy/dx= -y,y(0) = 1. In this cases< 0, |r2| > 1, and Simpson's rule, if uncorrected, produces instability.Table III shows the differenceE=ens-ynbetween the true solutionensand the computed solutionynafternsteps of the computation. Six values ofkare used in table III,k= ∞ (that is, no stabilization),k= 169, 39, 19, 5, and 3. Four values ofsare used, namelys= -0.10, -0.07, -0.04, and -0.01. The numbernof steps in the computations varies from 300 for larger values of -sto 2000 for the smallest. Not all computations were carried to the full number of steps shown at the left, hence some columns are partially blank.The number of decimal places is indicated for each division of the table. For example ats= -0.10,k= 169, andn= 300, the entry -31 means -0.000031, while fors= -0.04,k= 169,n= 500, the entry -6 means -0.00000006.From table II we obtain the integral parts ofqcorresponding to the given values ofsand find that according to theory the solution should be stable fors= -0.10 ifk< 21, fors= -0.07 ifk< 30, fors= -0.04 ifk< 52, and fors= -0.01 ifk< 208. Hence in table III the three right-hand columns should be stable for all four values ofs, four right-hand columns should be stable fors= -0.04, and five right-hand columns fors= -0.01. The computations appear to conform to the theory, since the error is negligible in these cases. Occasional errors of one unit in the last place are to be explained by the accidents of roundoff, for if they were due to instability they would increase withn. (The error -2 fork= 169 atn= 2000 is unexplained, but apparently is not due to instability, as it persisted without increasing through many steps between 1800 and 2000.)The results shown in table III illustrate the normal situation occurring in practice, where ifhis properly chosen and the machine operates correctly, the only source of error is roundoff.We note that of two consecutive values ofkthe odd value is likely to give somewhat better results. For ifkis even no stabilization occurs at odd values ofn, and since Simpson's rule operates over two intervals the effect of stabilization only reaches the odd entries indirectly through the derivativey′.It is the intent of the authors to treat differential systems of higher order in a future paper.
