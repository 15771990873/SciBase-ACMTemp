This paper deals with the dispatching problem that arises when a computer is able to execute asynchronous routines in parallel. It will contain a brief description of the pertinent features of such a computer (the IBM 709) and then describe a program which handles the dispatching semi-automatically fairly efficiently for a wide class of problems on the 709. This paper deals with the dispatching problem only and does not deal with conversion or with input-output constraints (such as record sizes or character coding) that are introduced by external equipment which cause tapes generated externally to differ from tapes written by the 709 itself.
