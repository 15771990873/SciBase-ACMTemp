Some general results about hierarchies of undecidable problems in automata theory are given, and studies are described which show how properties of sets accepted by automata (i.e. languages) change from decidable to undecidable problems as the computational power of the automata is increased. This work also yields unified techniques which characterize for different languages large classes of undecidable problems.
