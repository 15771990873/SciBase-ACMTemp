An attempt is made to carry out a program (outlined in a previous paper) for defining the concept of a random or patternless, finite binary sequence, and for subsequently defining a random or patternless, infinite binary sequence to be a sequence whose initial segments are all random or patternless finite binary sequences. A definition based on the bounded-transfer Turing machine is given detailed study, but insufficient understanding of this computing machine precludes a complete treatment. A computing machine is introduced which avoids these difficulties.
