A number of observations and comments are directed toward suggesting that more than the usual engineering flavor be given to computer science. The engineering aspect is important because most present difficulties in this field do not involve the theoretical question of whether certain things can be done, but rather the practical question of how can they be accomplished well and simply.The teaching of computer science could be made more effective by various alterations, for example, the inclusion of a laboratory course in programming, the requirement for a strong minor in something other than mathematics, and more practical coding and less abstract theory, as well as more seriousness and less game playing.
