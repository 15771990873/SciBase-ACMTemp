A one-dimensional array of finite-state machines is being considered as a model for sequence replication. The authors consider the initial state of the firstkmachines in the array as representing the sequence ofksymbols to be replicated along the array. A construction scheme is developed which allows for such replication to take place. It is also shown that the speed of replication approaches synchronous speed.
