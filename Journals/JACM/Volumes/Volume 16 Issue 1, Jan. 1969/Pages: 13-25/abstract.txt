MERCURY is a computer-aided system for the selective distribution of Bell Telephone Laboratories technical reports to employees. MERCURY is based on the idea that the job of distribution should be divided between the author and the reader with each performing that part of the job which he does best. The author is asked to describe the interests of the readers to whom his report should be sent. The reader is asked to described the reports that he wishes to receive. The descriptions are made from a small structured vocabulary. The matching of report to reader and the printing of address labels is done by computer.
