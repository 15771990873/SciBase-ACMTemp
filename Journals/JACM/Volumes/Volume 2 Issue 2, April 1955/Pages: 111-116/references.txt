The first run consisted of p ( < 3000) for which the class number is even. See Cob_n, H., CSNumerical Study of Signature Rank of Cubic Cyclotomic Units , Mathematical Tables and Other Aids to Computation, voL 8, 1954, pp. 186-188.
The list must contain all q < p/9 ; see footnote 7.
Accordio toelena Thue (Nagell, T " ntroductioo to Number Theory, " 1951, p. 122), all residue classes rood q are represented by some ratio x/y with max(I x I, I Y 1) < k /' Hence we ascertain by this method all primes q ( < p/9) for which f(x, y) splits into linear factors modulo q.
The fact that we need study only primes q subject to this inequality follows i from He MIInKOWSKI-limit ct IHUUALX Jr, Davenrort H "On the Product of Three Homogeneous Linear Forms IV, ' Proc. Cambridge Philosophical Society, vol. 39, 1943, pp. 1-21.
This is a property of the q-adic approximation (of the root of f (, 1) = 0 ) by means of rational integers (x /y ).
For the primes of the f i r s t run from 163 to 1399 (inclusive ) the right-hand term of inequality (2) had been taken a s f3 which turned out to be much I less satisfactory although consistent with footnote 6.
In class -field theory it is of some interest to note that here the smallest splitting prime happens to have principal ideal factors, as was demonstrated by the (omited)prime power print-outs.
This is equivalent to saying that if we had a relationship among group elements E = Q1e1.. Qv-1 e? ? then the group element Qv lies in the group generated by QI ''''' Qv-1' (The generators are not necessarily minimal).
The actual values of h are equal to 4 in the first run and 1 in the second run with the exception of p = 1777 where h-- 16, p = 1063 where h= 13, and p -- 1129 where h = 7, according to an unpublished table kindly communicated by P. Swinnerton-Dyer.
