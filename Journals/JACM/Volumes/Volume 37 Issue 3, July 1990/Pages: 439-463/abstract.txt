Lower bounds on the complexity of orthogonal range searching in the
static case are established. Specifically, we consider the following
dominance search problem: Given a collection ofnweighted points ind-space and a query pointq, compute the cumulative weight of
the points dominated (in all coordinates) byq. It is assumed that the weights are
chosen in a commutative semigroup and that the query time measures only
the number of arithmetic operations needed to compute the answer. It is
proved that ifmunits of storage are
available, then the query time is at least proportional to (logn/log(2m/n))d–1in both the worst and average cases. This lower bound is provably tight

on the time required for executingninserts and queries is also established.—Author's  Abstract
