An arithmetic formula is multilinear if the polynomial computed by each of its subformulas is multilinear. We prove that any multilinear arithmetic formula for the permanent or the determinant of ann√ónmatrix is of size super-polynomial inn. Previously, super-polynomial lower bounds were not known (for any explicit function) even for the special case of multilinear formulas of constant depth.
