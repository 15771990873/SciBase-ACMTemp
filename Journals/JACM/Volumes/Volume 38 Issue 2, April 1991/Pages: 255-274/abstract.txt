Certain problems related to the length of cycles and paths modulo a given integer are studied. Linear-time algorithms are presented that determine whether all cycles in an undirected graph are of lengthPmodQand whether all paths between two specified nodes are of lengthPmodQ, for fixed integersP.Q. These results are compared to those for directed graphs.
