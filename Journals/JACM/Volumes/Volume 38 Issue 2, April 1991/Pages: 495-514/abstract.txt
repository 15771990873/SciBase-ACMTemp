LetK(m) denote the smallest number with the property that everym-state finite automaton can be built as a neural net usingK(m) or fewer neurons. A counting argument shows thatK(m) is at least &OHgr;((mlogm)1/3), and a construction shows thatK(m) is at mostO(m3/4). The counting argument and the construction allow neural nets with arbitrarily complex local structure and thus may require neurons that themselves amount to complicated networks. Mild, and in practical situations almost necessary, constraints on the local   structure of the network give, again by a counting argument and a construction, lower and upper bounds forK(m) that are both linear inm.
