It is proved that no finite computation tree with operations { +, -, *, /, mod, < } can decide whether the greatest common divisor (gcd) ofaandbis one, for all pairs of integersaandb. This settles a problem posed by Gro¨tschel et al. Moreover, if the constants explicitly involved in any operation performed in the tree are restricted to be “0” and “1” (and any other constant must be computed), then we prove an &OHgr;(log logn) lower bound on the depth of any computation tree with operations { +, -, *, /, mod, < } that decides whether the gcd ofaandbis one, for all pairs ofn-bit integersaandb.A novel technique for handling the truncation operation is implicit in the proof of this lower bound. In a companion paper, other lower bounds for a large class of problems are proved using a similar technique.
