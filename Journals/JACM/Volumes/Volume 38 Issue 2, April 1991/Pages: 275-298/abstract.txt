LetSbe a set,f:S×S→R+a bivariate function, andf(x,S) themaximumvalue off(x,y) over all elementsy∈S. We say thatfisdecomposablewith respect with the maximum iff(x,S) = max    {f(x,S1),f(x,S2),…,f(x,Sk)} for any decompositionS= &mgr;i=1i=kSi. Computing the maximum (minimum) value of a decomposable function is inherent in many problems of computational geometry and robotics. In this paper, a general technique is presented for updating the maximum (minimum) value of a decomposable function as elements are inserted into and deleted from the setS. Our result holds for asemi-onlinemodel of dynamization: When an element is inserted, we are told how long it will stay. Applications of this technique include efficient algorithms fordynamicallycomputing the diameter or closest pair of a set of points, minimum separation among a set of rectangles, smallest distance between a set of points and a set of hyperplanes, and largest or smallest area (perimeter) retangles determined by a set of points. These problems are fundamental to application areas such as robotics, VLSI masking, and optimization.
