The random, heuristic search algorithm called simulated annealing is considered for the problem of finding the maximum cardinality matching in a graph. It is shown that neither a basic form of the algorithm, nor any other algorithm in a fairly large related class of algorithms, can find maximum cardinality matchings such that the average time required grows as a polynomial in the number of nodes of the graph. In contrast, it is also shown for arbitrary graphs that a degenerate form of the basic annealing algorithm (obtained by letting “temperature” be a suitably chosen constant) produces matchings withnearlymaximum cardinality in polynomial average time.
