Exponential lower bounds on the complexity of computing the clique functions in the Boolean decision-tree model are proved. For one-time-only branching programs, large polynomial lower bounds are proved fork-clique functions ifkis fixed, and exponential lower bounds ifkincreases withn. Finally, the hierarchy of the classes BPd(P) of all sequences of Boolean functions that may be computed byd-times only branching programs of polynomial size is introduced. It is shown constructively that BP1(P) is a proper subset of BP2(P).
