A modification of Pohl's bidirectional heuristic search algorithm is described together with a simplified implementation. Theorems are proved about conditions yielding shortest paths. The results are given of a worst-case analysis of different algorithms, suggesting a rank order of their quality. Results that Pohl had obtained with a unidirectional heuristic search algorithm on the 15-puzzle are compared with the results obtained with the new — simplified — algorithm.
