It is shown that every deterministic multitape Turing machine of time complexityt(n) can be simulated by a deterministic Turing machine of tape complexityt(n)/logt(n). Consequently, for tape constructablet(n), the class of languages recognizable by multitape Turing machines of time complexityt(n) is strictly contained in the class of languages recognized by Turing machines of tape complexityt(n). In particular the context-sensitive languages cannot be recognized in linear time by deterministic multitape Turing machines.
