A queueing-type model is used to analyze the storage requirements of a component of a real-time data entry system. The objectives and criteria of the buffer management procedure are identified and related to the variables of the model. Both infinite and finite buffers are considered. The analysis is done symbolically in part and numerically in part to accommodate input processes that are peculiar to the system. Techniques to obtain overflow probabilities are described in detail. It is shown that creating a pool of storage blocks for all the terminals is a better policy than maintaining a separate buffer for each station. The savings brought about by this policy are remarkably insensitive to the characteristics of the input process.
