A dominance relationDis a binary relation defined on the set of partial problems generated in a branch-and-bound algorithm, such thatPiDPj(wherePiandPjare partial problems) implies thatPjcan be excluded from consideration without loss of optimality of the given problem ifPihas already been generated whenPjis selected for the test. The branch-and-bound computation is usually enhanced by adding the test based on a dominance relation.A dominance relationD′is said to be stronger than a dominance relationDifPiDPjalways impliesPiD′Pj. Although it seems obvious that a stronger dominance relation makes the resulting algorithm more efficient, counterexamples can easily be constructed. In this paper, however, four classes of branch-and-bound algorithms are found in which a stronger dominance relation always gives a more efficient algorithm. This indicates that the monotonicity property of dominance relations would be observed in a rather wide class of branch-and-bound algorithms, thus encouraging the designer of a branch-and-bound algorithm to find the strongest possible dominance relation.
