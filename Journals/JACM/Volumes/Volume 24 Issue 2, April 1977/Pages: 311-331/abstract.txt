The foundations are laid for a theory of multiplicative complexity of algebras and it is shown how “multiplication problems” such as multiplication of matrices, polynomials, quaternions, etc., are instances of this theory. The usefulness of the theory is then demonstrated by utilizing algebraic ideas and results to derive complexity bounds. In particular linear upper and lower bounds for the complexity of certain types of algebras are established.
