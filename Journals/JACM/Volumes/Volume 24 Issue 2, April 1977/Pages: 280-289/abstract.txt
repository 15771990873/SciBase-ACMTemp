The finishing time properties of several heuristic algorithms for schedulingnindependent tasks onmnonidentical processors are studied. In particular, form= 2 annlogntime-bounded algorithm is given which generates a schedule having a finishing time of at most (âˆš5 + 1)/2 of the optimal finishing time. A simplified scheduling problem involving identical processors and restricted task sets is shown to be P-complete. However, the LPT algorithm applied to this problem yields schedules which are near optimal for largen.
