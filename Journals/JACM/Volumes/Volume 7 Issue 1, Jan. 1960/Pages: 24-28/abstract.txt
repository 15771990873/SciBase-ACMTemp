Given a sequential machine, in the terminology of E. F. Moore,Annals of Mathematics Studies,No. 34, 1956, a problem of some interest is that of determining testing procedures which will enable one to transform it into a known state starting from an initial situation in which only the set of possible states is given.To treat this problem, we introduce the concept of ambiguity, and show how the functional equation approach of dynamic programming can be applied.
