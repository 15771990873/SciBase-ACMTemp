In Part I of this paper [1] the authors have shown that instability in Milne's method of solving differential equations numerically [2] can be avoided by the occasional use of Newton's “three eights” quadrature formula. Part I dealt with a single differential equation of first order. In Part II the analysis is extended to equations and systems of equations of higher order.A differential equation of ordermor a system of equations of total ordermcan be expressed bymsimultaneous equations of the first orderdyi/dt=Fi(y1, …,ym,t), (i= 1, 2, …,m) (1) inmdependent variablesyi. Let y denote a vector inm-space which has the componentsy1, …,ym. Let z, with componentsz1,z2, …,zm, denote a small variation in the vector y such as might have been produced by a small error occurring at an earlier value oft. The differential system (1) can be written in vector form asdy/dt= F(y,t) (2) and the varied vector y + z satisfiesdy/dt+dz/dt= F (y + z,t). (3)Let us assume that the functionsFihave continuous partial derivatives ∂Fi/∂yi=aijand let G denote them×mmatrix [aij]. From equations (2) and (3) it may be shown that to terms of the first order in the small quantity z we havedz/dt= Gz. (4)The matrix G is usually a variable depending on they's andt, but it is possible to forecast the general behavior of the error by treating the simple case where G is constant. (See [3] of Part I.) Assuming that G is constant we first of all briefly review some well-known facts about the solution of the differential system (4).If we introduce a new vector variable x in place of the variable z by means of a nonsingular linear transformation x = Tz, it is seen that the system (4) is transformed intodx/dt= (TGT-1)x. (5)In particular the transformation T may be chosen so as to put the matrix TGT-1into the classical canonical form. (Cf. e.g., Turnbull and Aitkin [3].) Then if the latent roots &lgr;1, &lgr;2, … &lgr;m, of the matrix G are all distinct, the new matrix TGT-1has these latent roots in the principal diagonal and zeros elsewhere. In these case the differential system (5) separates intomindependent equationsdxi/dt= &lgr;ixi
