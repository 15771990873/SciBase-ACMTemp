Semidefinite programs (SDPs) have been used in many recent approximation algorithms. We develop a general primal-dual approach to solve SDPs using a generalization of the well-known multiplicative weights update rule to symmetric matrices. For a number of problems, such as SparsestCutand BalancedSeparatorin undirected and directed weighted graphs, MinUnCutand Min2CNF Deletion, this yields combinatorial approximation algorithms that are significantly more efficient than interior point methods. The design of our primal-dual algorithms is guided by a robust analysis of rounding algorithms used to obtain integer solutions from fractional ones. Our ideas have proved useful in quantum computing, especially the recent result of Jain et al. [2011] that QIP &equals; PSPACE.
