We study the following simple Bayesian auction setting:mitems are sold tonselfish bidders inmindependent second-price auctions. Each bidder has aprivatevaluation function that specifies his or her complex preferences overallsubsets of items. Bidders only havebeliefsabout the valuation functions of the other bidders, in the form of probability distributions. The objective is to allocate the items to the bidders in a way that provides a good approximation to the optimal social welfare value. We show that if bidders have submodular or, more generally, fractionally subadditive (aka XOS) valuation functions, every Bayes-Nash equilibrium of the resulting game provides a 2-approximation to the optimal social welfare. Moreover, we show that in the full-information game, a pure Nash always exists and can be found in time that is polynomial in bothmandn.
