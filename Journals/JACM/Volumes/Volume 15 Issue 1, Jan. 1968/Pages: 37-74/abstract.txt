A programming language for the IBM 360 computers and aspects of its implementation are described. The language, called PL360, provides the facilities of a symbolic machine language, but displays a structure defined by a recursive syntax. PL360 was designed to improve the readability of programs which must take into account specific characteristics and limitations of a particular computer. It represents an attempt to further the state of the art of programming by encouraging and even forcing the programmer to improve his style of exposition and his principles and discipline in program organization. Because of its inherent simplicity, the language is particularly well suited for tutorial purposes.The attempt to present a computer as a systematically organized entity is also hoped to be of interest to designers of future computers.
