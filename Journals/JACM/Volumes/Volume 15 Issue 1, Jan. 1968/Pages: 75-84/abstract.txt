An approximate but fairly rapid method for solving integer linear programming problems is presented, which utilizes, in part, some of the philosophy of “direct search” methods. The method is divided into phases which can be applied in order and has the desirable characteristic that a best feasible solution is always available. Numerical results are presented for a number of test problems. Some possible extensions and improvements are also presented.
