In this paper the construction of a switching network capable ofn!-permutation of itsninput terminals to itsnoutput terminals is described. The building blocks for this network are binary cells capable of permuting their two input terminals to their two output terminals.The number of cells used by the network is <n· log2n-n+ 1> = ∑nk=12
