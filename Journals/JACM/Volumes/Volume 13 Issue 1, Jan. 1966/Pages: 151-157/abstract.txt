Formulas and algorithms have recently been given for calculating the number of symmetry types of functions, networks and automata under various transformation groups. In almost all cases, the computations involved are quite difficult and require the use of a digital computer. In this paper, asymptotic estimates are given for these numbers, which are trivial to compute and which are very accurate in most cases even for small values of the parameters.
