This paper deals with the synthesis of sequential machines (without a distinguished initial state) which satisfies a specified list of input sequences and corresponding output sequences. Readily testable necessary and sufficient conditions are given for such a list to result in a realizable machine, and an algorithm is formulated for constructing the machine when these conditions are fulfilled.
