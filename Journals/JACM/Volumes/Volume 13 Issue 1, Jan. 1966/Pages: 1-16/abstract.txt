The problem studied is the effect of a time-sharing environment on the structure of programs and on the addressing strategies which may be employed in the hardware. An account is given of some very recent developments toward reduction in the system overhead needed to facilitate time-sharing. One hardware-software scheme designed to implement this reduction is described in some detail.
