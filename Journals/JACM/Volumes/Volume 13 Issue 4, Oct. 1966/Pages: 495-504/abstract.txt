A formal system is presented for the differentiation of mathematical formulas which can be implemented on a digital computer. The system departs in concept from others in that the programming language is nonprocedural, permitting the statement of the problem for the machine to more closely resemble the corresponding statement for the human. Although limited ostensibly to the narrow and well-defined problem of mechanizing differentiation, many of the ideas and techniques presented can be applied in the broader context of the deeper problem of mechanizing mathematics. They should also be useful in programming theory, where the fundamental problem continues to be the narrowing of the gap between a natural language statement of a problem and a formal language statement acceptable to a computer.
