The occurrence pattern of clusterings of keys is analyzed by use of the generating function. Probabilities of occurrences of several clustered patterns are given as the coefficients of generating functions. Moreover, the result when a key-to-address transformation ofaK+b/modcis performed on clustered keys is briefly discussed.
