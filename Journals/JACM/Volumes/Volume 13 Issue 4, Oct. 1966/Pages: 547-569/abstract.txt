The use of Turing machines for calculating finite binary sequences is studied from the point of view of information theory and the theory of recursive functions. Various results are obtained concerning the number of instructions in programs. A modified form of Turing machine is studied from the same point of view. An application to the problem of defining a patternless sequence is proposed in terms of the concepts here developed.
