With the availability of high speed electronic computers it is now quite convenient to devise statistical experiments for the purpose of estimating certain mathematical constants and functions. The paper contains statistical formulas for estimating such mathematical constants and functions as &pgr;,C(Euler's constant),e, &PSgr;(1)(1), &Ggr;(x), Inx,B(x, y), arctanx, &PSgr;(p) and polygamma functions. Statistical estimates of these quantities may be used to construct desired confidence intervals for these parameters. Although numerical techniques are available to approximate these mathematical quantities very satisfactorily, a statistical approach to these problems seems to deserve mention in the scientific literature. Numerical illustrations are given in the paper which also give some indication of the effect of pseudorandom numbers on the final results. Statistical procedures, considered in the paper, make extensive use of a high speed electronic computer which may help to develop a positive attitude among theoreticians, promising students of mathematics and others toward the role of computers in the ever-expanding scientific work.
