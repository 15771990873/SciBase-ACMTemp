A natural problem, related to the (known unsolvable) halting problem for Post normal systems, arises when one considers, for a given Post normal system, whether the system halts (eventually) oneveryword over its alphabet. For polygenic systems, this problem is shown to be recursively unsolvable by constructing a reduction from the “Domino Problem.”
