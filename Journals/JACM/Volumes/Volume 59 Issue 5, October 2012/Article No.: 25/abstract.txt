We provide evidence that it is computationally difficult to approximate the partition function of the ferromagneticq-state Potts model whenq> 2. Specifically, we show that the partition function is hard for the complexity class #RHPi under approximation-preserving reducibility. Thus, it is as hard to approximate the partition function as it is to find approximate solutions to a wide range of counting problems, including that of determining the number of independent sets in a bipartite graph. Our proof exploits the first-order phase transition of the “random cluster” model, which is a probability distribution on graphs that is closely related to theq-state Potts model.
