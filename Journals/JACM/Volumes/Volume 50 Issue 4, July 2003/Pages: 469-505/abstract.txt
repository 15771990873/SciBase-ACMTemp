The theory of generalized functions is the foundation of the modern theory of partial differential equations (PDE). As computers are playing an ever-larger role in solving PDEs, it is important to know those operations involving generalized functions in analysis and PDE that can be computed on digital computers. In this article, we introduce natural concepts of computability on test functions and generalized functions, as well as computability on Schwartz test functions and tempered distributions. Type-2 Turing machines are used as the machine model [Weihrauch 2000]. It is shown here that differentiation and integration on distributions are computable operators, and various types of Fourier transforms and convolutions are also computable operators. As an application, it is shown that the solution operator of the distributional inhomogeneous three dimensional wave equation is computable.
