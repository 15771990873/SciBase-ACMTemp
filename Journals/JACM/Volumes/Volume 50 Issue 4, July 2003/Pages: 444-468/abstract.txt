This article introduces thesieve, a novel building block that allows to adapt to the number of simultaneously active processes (thepoint contention) during the execution of an operation. We present an implementation of the sieve in which each sieve operation requiresO(klogk) steps, wherekis the point contention during the operation.The sieve is the cornerstone of the first wait-free algorithms that adapt to point contention using only read and write operations. Specifically, we present efficient algorithms for long-lived renaming, timestamping and collecting information.
