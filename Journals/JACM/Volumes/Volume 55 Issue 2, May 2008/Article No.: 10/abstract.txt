We construct binary codes for fingerprinting digital documents. Our codes fornusers that are &epsi;-secure againstcpirates have lengthO(c2log(n/&epsi;)). This improves the codes proposed by Boneh and Shaw &lsqb;1998&rsqb; whose length is approximately the square of this length. The improvement carries over to works using the Boneh--Shaw code as a primitive, for example, to the dynamic traitor tracing scheme of Tassa &lsqb;2005&rsqb;.By proving matching lower bounds we establish that the length of our codes is best within a constant factor for reasonable error probabilities. This lower bound generalizes the bound found independently by Peikert et al. &lsqb;2003&rsqb; that applies to a limited class of codes. Our results also imply that randomized fingerprint codes over a binary alphabet are as powerful as over an arbitrary alphabet and the equal strength of two distinct models for fingerprinting.
