In this paper, a new asymptotic method is developed for analyzing closed BCMP queuing networks with a single class (chain) consisting of a large number of customers, a single infinite server queue, and a large number of single server queues with fixed (state-independent) service rates. Asymptotic approximations are computed for the normalization constant (partition function) starting directly from a recursion relation of Buzen. The approach of the authors employs the ray method of geometrical optics and the method of matched asymptotic expansions. The method is applicable when the servers have nearly equal relative utilizations or can be divided into classes with nearly equal relative utilizations. Numerical comparisons are given that illustrate the accuracy of the asymptotic approximations.
