The fundamental satisfiability problem for word equations has been solved recently by Makanin. However, this algorithm is purely a decision algorithm. The main result of this paper solves the complementary problem of generating the set of all solutions. Specifically, the algorithm in this paper generates, given a word equation, a minimal and complete set of unifiers. It stops if this set is finite.
