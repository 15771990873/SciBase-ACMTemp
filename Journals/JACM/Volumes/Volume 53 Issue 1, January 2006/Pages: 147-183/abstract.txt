We consider the sequence comparison problem, also known as “hidden” pattern problem, where one searches for a givensubsequencein a text (rather than a string understood as a sequence of consecutive symbols). A characteristic parameter is the number of occurrences of a given patternwof lengthmas a subsequence in a random text of lengthngenerated by a memoryless source. Spacings between letters of the pattern may either be constrained or not in order to define valid occurrences. We determine the mean and the variance of the number of occurrences, and establish a Gaussian limit law and large deviations. These results are obtained via combinatorics on words, formal language techniques, and methods of analytic combinatorics based on generating functions. The motivations to study this problem come from an attempt at finding a reliable threshold for intrusion detections, from textual data processing applications, and from molecular biology.
