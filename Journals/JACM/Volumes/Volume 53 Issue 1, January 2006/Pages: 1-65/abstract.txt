In this article we present a theoretical analysis of the onlineSum-of-Squaresalgorithm (SS) for bin packing along with several new variants.SSis applicable to any instance of bin packing in which the bin capacityBand item sizess(a) are integral (or can be scaled to be so), and runs in timeO(nB). It performs remarkably well from an average case point of view: For any discrete distribution in which the optimal expected waste is sublinear,SSalso has sublinear expected waste. For any discrete distribution where the optimal expected waste is bounded,SShas expected waste at mostO(logn). We also discuss several interesting variants onSS, including a randomizedO(nBlogB)-time online algorithmSS&ast; whose expected behavior is essentially optimal for all discrete distributions. AlgorithmSS&ast; depends on a new linear-programming-based pseudopolynomial-time algorithm for solving the NP-hard problem of determining, given a discrete distributionF, just what is the growth rate for the optimal expected waste.
