The Fishspear priority queue algorithm is presented and analyzed. Fishspear is comparable to the usual heap algorithm in its worst-case running time, and its relative performance is much better in many common situations. Fishspear also differs from the heap method in that it can be implemented efficiently using sequential storage such as stacks or tapes, making it potentially attractive for implementation of very large queues on paged memory systems.
