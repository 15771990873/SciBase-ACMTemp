A particular decision-theoretic approach to the problem of detecting straight edges and lines in pictures is discussed. A model is proposed of the appearance of scenes consisting of prismatic solids, taking into account blurring, noise, and smooth variations in intensity over faces. A suboptimal statistical decision procedure is developed for the identification of a line within a narrow band in the field of view, given an array of intensity values from within the band. The performance of this procedure is illustrated and discussed.
