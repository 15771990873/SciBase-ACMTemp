Consider the set of multistep formulas ∑l-1jmn-k&agr;ijxmn+j-h∑l-1jmn-k&bgr;ijxmn+j= 0,i= 1, ···,l, wherexmn+j=ymn+jforj= -k, ···, -1 andxn= ƒn= ƒ(xn, tn). These formulas are solved simultaneously for thexmn+jwithj= 0, ···,l- 1 in terms of thexmn+jwithj= -k, ··· , - 1, which are assumed to be known.Thenymn+jis defined to bexmn+jforj= 0, ··· ,m- 1. Forj=m, ··· ,l- 1,xmn+jis discarded. The set ofy's generated in this manner for successive values ofnprovide an approximate solution of the initial value problem:y= ƒ(y, t),y(t0) =y0. It is conjectured that if the method, which is referred to as the composite multistep method, isA-stable, then its maximum order is 2l. In addition to noting that the conjecture conforms to Dahlquist's bound of 2 forl= 1, the conjecture is verified fork= 1. A third-orderA-stable method withm=l= 2 is given as an example, and numerical results established in applying a fourth-orderA-stable method withm= 1 andl= 2 are described.A-stable methods withm=loffer the promise of high order and a minimum of function evaluations—evaluation of ƒ(y, t) at solution points. Furthermore, the prospect that such methods might exist withk= 1—only one past point—means that step-size control can be easily implemented
