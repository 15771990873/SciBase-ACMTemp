A combinatorial problem arising from the analysis of a model of interleaved memory systems is studied. The performance measure whose calculation defines this problem is based on the distribution of the number of modules in operation during a memory cycle, assuming saturated demand and an arbitrary but fixed number of modules.In general terms the problem is as follows. Suppose we have a Markov chain ofnstates numbered 0, 1, ···,n- 1. For eachiassume that the one-step transition probability from stateito state (i+ 1) modnis given by the parameter&agr;and from stateito any other state is&bgr;= (1 -&agr;)/(n- 1). Given an initial state, the problem is to find the expected number of states through which the system passes before returning to a state previously entered. The principal result of the paper is a recursive procedure for computing this expected number of states. The complexity of the procedure is seen to be small enough to enable practical numerical studies of interleaved memory systems.
