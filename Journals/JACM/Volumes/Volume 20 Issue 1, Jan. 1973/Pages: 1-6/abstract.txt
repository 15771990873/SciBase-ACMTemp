Two upper bounds for the total path length of binary trees are obtained. One is for node-trees, and bounds the internal (or root-to-node) path length; the other is for leaf-trees, and bounds the external (or root-to-leaf) path length. These bounds involve a quantity called the balance, which allows the bounds to adapt from thenlognbehavior of a completely balanced tree to then2behavior of a most skewed tree. These bounds are illustrated for the case of Fibonacci trees.
