Characterizations of digital “simple arcs” and “simple closed curves” are given. In particular, it is shown that the following are equivalent for setsShaving more than four points: (1)Sis a simple curve; (2)Sis connected and each point ofShas exactly two neighbors inS; (3)Sis connected, has exactly one hole, and has no deletable points. It follows that if a “shrinking” algorithm is applied to a connectedSthat has exactly one hole, it shrinks to a simple curve.
