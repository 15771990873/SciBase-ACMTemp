This paper presents new upper bounds for channel routing of multiterminal nets, which answers the long-standing open question whether or not multiterminal problems really require channels two times wider than 2-terminal problems. We transform any multiterminal problem of densitydinto a so-called extended simple channel routing problem (ESCRP) of density3d/2+Odlogd. We then descibe routing algorithms for solving ESCRPs in three different models. The channel widthwis≤3d/2+Odlogdin the knock-knee and unit-vertical-overlap models, andw≤3d/2+Odlogd+Ofin the Manhattan model, wherefis the flux of the problem. In all three cases, we improve the best-known upper bounds.
