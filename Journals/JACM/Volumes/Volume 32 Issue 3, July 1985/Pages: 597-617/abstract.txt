A database is said to allow range restrictions if one may request that only records with some specified field in a specified range be considered when answering a given query. A transformation is presented that enables range restrictions to be added to an arbitrary dynamic data structure onnelements, provided that the problem satisfies a certain decomposability condition and that one is willing to allow increases by a factor ofO(logn) in the worst-case time for an operation and in the space used. This is a generalization of a known transformation that works for static structures. This transformation is then used to produce a data structure for range queries inkdimensions with worst-case times ofO(logkn) for each insertion, deletion, or query operation.
