The one-dimensional on-line bin-packing problem is considered, A simpleO(1)-space andO(n)-time algorithm, called HARMONICM, is presented. It is shown that this algorithm can achieve a worst-case performance ratio of less than 1.692, which is better than that of theO(n)-space andO(nlogn)-time algorithm FIRST FIT. Also shown is that 1.691 â€¦ is a lower bound forall0(1)-space on-line bin-packing algorithms. Finally a revised version of HARMONICM, anO(n)-space andO(n)- time algorithm, is presented and is shown to have a worst-case performance ratio of less than 1.636.d
