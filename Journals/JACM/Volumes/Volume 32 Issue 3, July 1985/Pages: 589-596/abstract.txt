A problem related to the decentralized control of a multiple access channel is considered: Supposekstations from an ensemble ofnsimultaneously transmit to a multiple access channel that provides the feedback 0, 1, or 2+, denotingk= 0,k= 1, ork≥ 2, respectively. Ifk= 1, then the transmission succeeds. But ifk≥ 2, as a result of the conflict, none of the transmissions succeed. An algorithm toresolvea conflict determines how to schedule retransmissions so that each of the conflicting stations eventually transmits singly to the channel. In this paper, a general model of deterministic algorithms to resolve conflicts is introduced, and it is established that, for allkandn(2 ≤k≤n), &OHgr;(k(logn)/(logk)) time must elapse in the worst case before allktransmissions succeed.
