An analysis of structured flowcharts is presented, where size is measured by the number,n, of decision nodes (IF-THEN-ELSE and DO-WHILE nodes). For all classes of structured flowcharts considered, the number of charts is approximately,cn-3/2&ggr;n, for largen, wherec>and&ggr;are parameters that depend on the class. It is also shown that most large flowcharts consist of a short sequence of basic charts (IF-THEN-ELSE and DO-WHILE charts). The average length of such sequences is 2.5.
