A new model of computation for VLSI, based on the assumption that time for propagating information is at least linear in the distance, is proposed. While accommodating for basic laws of physics, the model is designed to be general and technology independent. Thus, from a complexity viewpoint, it is especially suited for deriving lower bounds and trade-offs. New results for a number of problems, including fan-in, transitive functions, matrix multiplication, and sorting are presented. As regards upper bounds, it must be noted that, because of communication costs, the model clearly favors regular and pipelined architectures (e.g., systolic arrays).
