Optimal &OHgr;(logn/log logn) lower bounds on the time for CRCW PRAMS with polynomially bounded numbers of processors or memory cells to compute parity and a number of related problems are proven. A strict time hierarchy of explicit Boolean functions ofnbits on such machines that holds up to &Ogr;(logn/log logn) time is also exhibited. That is, for every time boundTwithin this range a function is exhibited that can be easily computed using polynomial resources in timeTbut requires more than polynomial resources to be computed in timeT- 1. Finally, it is shown that almost all Boolean functions ofnbits require logn- log logn+ &OHgr;(1) time when the number of processors is at most polynomial inn. The bounds do not place restrictions on the uniformity of the algorithms nor on the instruction sets of the machines.
