Lower bounds are proven on the parallel-time complexity of several basic functions on the most powerful concurrent-read concurrent-write PRAM with unlimited shared memory and unlimited power of individual processors (denoted by PRIORITY(∞)):It is proved that with a number of processors polynomial inn, &OHgr; (logn) time is needed for addition, multiplication or bitwise OR ofnnumbers, when each number hasn' bits. Hence even thebit complexity(i.e., the time complexity as a function of the total number of bits in the input) is logarithmic in this case. This improves a beautiful result of Meyer auf der Heide and Wigderson [22]. They proved a lognlower bound using Ramsey-type techniques. Using Ramsey theory, it is possible to get an upper bound on the number of bits in the inputs used. However, for the case of polynomially many processors, this upper bound is more than a polynomial inn.An &OHgr; (logn) lower bound is given for PRIORITY(∞) withno(1)processors on a function with inputs from {0, 1}, namely for the function ƒ(x1, … ,xn,) = &Sgr;nl- 1xlaiwhereais fixed andxi&egr; {0, 1}.Finally, by a new efficient simulation of PRIORITY(∞) by unbounded fan-in circuits, that with less than exponential number of processors, it is proven a PRIORITY(∞) cannot compute PARITY in constant time, and withnO(1)
