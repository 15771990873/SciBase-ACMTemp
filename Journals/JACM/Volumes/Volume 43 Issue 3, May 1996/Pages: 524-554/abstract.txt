We present a linear-time algorithm to decide for any fixed deterministic context-free languageLand input stringwwhetherwis a suffix of some string inL. In contrast to a previously published technique, the decision procedure may be extended to produce syntactic structures (parses) without an increase in time complexity. We also show how this algorithm may be applied to pocess incorrect input in linear time.
