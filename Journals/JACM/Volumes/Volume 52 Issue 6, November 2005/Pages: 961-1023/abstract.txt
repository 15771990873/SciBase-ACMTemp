We study a behavioral theory ofMobile Ambients, a process calculus for modelling mobile agents in wide-area networks, focussing onreduction barbed congruence. Our contribution is threefold. (1) We prove acontext lemmawhich shows that only parallel and nesting contexts need be examined to recover this congruence. (2) We characterize this congruence using alabeled bisimilarity: this requires novel techniques to deal with asynchronous movements of agents and with the invisibility of migrations of secret locations. (3) We develop refined proof methods involvingup-to proof techniques, which allow us to verify a set ofalgebraic lawsand the correctness of more complex examples.
