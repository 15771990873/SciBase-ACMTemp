We establish the first polynomial time-space lower bounds for satisfiability on general models of computation. We show that for any constantcless than the golden ratio there exists a positive constantdsuch that no deterministic random-access Turing machine can solve satisfiability in timencand spacend, wheredapproaches 1 whencdoes. On conondeterministic instead of deterministic machines, we prove the same for any constantcless than &2radic;.Our lower bounds apply to nondeterministic linear time and almost all natural NP-complete problems known. In fact, they even apply to the class of languages that can be solved on a nondeterministic machine in linear time and spacen1/c.Our proofs follow the paradigm of indirect diagonalization. We also use that paradigm to prove time-space lower bounds for languages higher up in the polynomial-time hierarchy.
