This article takes a new step towards closing the gap between pseudorandom functions (PRF) and their popular, bounded-input-length counterparts. This gap is both quantitative, because these counterparts are more efficient than PRF in various ways, and methodological, because these counterparts usually fit in the substitution-permutation network paradigm (SPN), which has not been used to construct PRF.We give several candidate PRFFithat are inspired by the SPN paradigm. Most of our candidates are more efficient than previous ones. Our main candidates are as follows.—F1: {0,1}n→ {0,1}nis an SPN whose S-box is a random function onbbits given as part of the seed. We prove thatF1resists attacks that run in time ≤ 2&epsi;b.—F2: {0,1}n→ {0,1}nis an SPN where the S-box is (patched) field inversion, a common choice in practical constructions. We show thatF2is computable with boolean circuits of sizen⋅ logO(1)nand that it has exponential security 2Ω(n)against linear and differential cryptanalysis.—F3: {0,1}n→ {0,1} is a nonstandard variant on the SPN paradigm, where “states” grow in length. We show thatF3is computable with TC0circuits of sizen1 &plus; &epsi;, for any &epsi; > 0, and that it is almost 3-wise independent.—F4: {0,1}n→ {0,1} uses an extreme setting of the SPN parameters (one round, one S-box, no diffusion matrix). The S-box is again (patched) field inversion. We show thatF4is computable by circuits of sizen⋅ logO(1)nand that it fools all parity tests on ≤20.9noutputs.Assuming the security of our candidates, our work narrows the gap between the Natural Proofs barrier and existing lower bounds in three models: circuits, TC0circuits, and Turing machines.
