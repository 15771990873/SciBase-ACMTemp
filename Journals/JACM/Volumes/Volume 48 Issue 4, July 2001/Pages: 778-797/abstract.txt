We examine the number of queries to input variables that a quantum algorithm requires to compute Boolean functions on {0,1}Nin theblack-boxmodel. We show that the exponential quantum speed-up obtained forpartialfunctions (i.e., problems involving a promise on the input) by Deutsch and Jozsa, Simon, and Shor cannot be obtained for anytotalfunction: if a quantum algorithm computes some total Boolean functionfwith small error probability usingTblack-box queries, then there is a classical deterministic algorithm that computesfexactly withO(Ts6) queries. We also give asymptotically tight characterizations ofTfor all symmetricfin the exact, zero-error, and bounded-error settings. Finally, we give new precise bounds for AND, OR, and PARITY. Our results are a quantum extension of the so-called polynomial method, which has been successfully applied in classical complexity theory, and also a quantum extension of results by Nisan about a polynomial relationship between randomized and deterministic decision tree complexity.
