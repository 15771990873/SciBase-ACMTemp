The following two important aspects of multilevel static memory management are treated: (1) memory loading, and (2) memory sizing. An algorithm is developed for the optimal loading of program and data files in various memory levels of given sizes. The selection of optimal sizes from a given set of finite alternatives is done through a cyclic queueing model, which recognizes the effects of queues and waiting times and helps in deriving a balanced system.
