Finite-precision interval arithmetic evaluation of a function ƒ ofnvariables at ann-dimensional rectangleTwhich is the Cartesian product of intervals yields an interval which is denoted byF(T). Correspondingly, finite-precision real arithmetic evaluation of ƒ at the midpointm(T) ofTyields a number which is denoted byf(m(T)) &Egr;F(T). Often,f(m(T)) is surprisingly close tom(F(T)). The purpose of this note is to provide some insight into this phenomenon by examining the case of infinite precision and rational functions. It is shown that if the gradient of ƒ is nonzero at a fixed pointt&Egr;T, then as the maximum edge lengthw(T) ofTapproaches zero, [m(F(T)) - ƒ(m(T))]/w(F(T)) =O(w(T)), whereF(T) and ƒ(m(T)) denote the infinite-precision results corresponding toF(T) andf(m(T)), respectively. More precise results are derived when ƒ is one of +, -, ×, or /.
