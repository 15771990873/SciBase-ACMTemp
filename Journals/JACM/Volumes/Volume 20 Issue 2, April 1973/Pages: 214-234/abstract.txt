A general theory of canonical precedence analysis is defined and studied. The familiar types of precedence analysis such as operator precedence or simple precedence occur as special cases of this theory. Among the theoretical results obtained are a characterization of the structure of precedence relations and the relation of canonical precedence schemes to operator sets.
