A lower bound for the number of additions necessary to compute a family of linear functions by a linear algorithm is given when an upper boundccan be assigned to the modulus of the complex numbers involved in the computation. In the case of the fast Fourier transform, the lower bound is (n/2) log2nwhenc= 1.
