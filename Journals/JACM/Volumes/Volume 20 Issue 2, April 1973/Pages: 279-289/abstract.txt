A direct (noniterative) method for solving some singular systems of equations arising from finite difference approximations to partial differential equations is developed. The Moore-Penrose generalized inverse of some large tensor product matrices is expressed in terms of smaller matrices. Some techniques are given to improve computational efficiency.
