The theory of J. A. Robinson's resolution principle, an inference rule for first-order predicate calculus, is unified and extended. A theorem-proving computer program based on the new theory is proposed and the proposed semantic resolution program is compared with hyper-resolution and set-of-support resolution programs. Renamable and semantic resolution are defined and shown to be identical. Given a modelM, semantic resolution is the resolution of a latent clash in which each “electron” is at least sometimes false underM; the nucleus is at least sometimes true underM.The completeness theorem for semantic resolution and all previous completeness theorems for resolution (including ordinary, hyper-, and set-of-support resolution) can be derived from a slightly more general form of the following theorem. IfUis a finite, truth-functionally unsatisfiable set of nonempty clauses and ifMis a ground model, then there exists an unresolved maximal semantic clash [E1,E2, · · ·,Eq,C] with nucleusCsuch that any set containingCand one or more of the electronsE1,E2, · · ·,Eqis an unresolved semantic clash inU.
