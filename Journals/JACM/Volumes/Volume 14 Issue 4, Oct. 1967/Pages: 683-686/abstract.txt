If, in a sequential machine, the output upon application of an input character depends only upon the current state of the machine and not upon the input character, the machine is called input-independent. Two states,pandq,of an input-independent machine are compatible if and only if the output strings from the machine starting in initial state,p, are the same as the output strings from the machine with initial state,q, for all input strings to the machine in both states.The minimal length of tape which tests compatibility of states in an input-independent sequential machine withnstates is (n2- 2n)/4 + 1 ifnis even, and (n2- 2n+ 1)/4 ifnis odd. There are machines with incompatible states such that no tapes of length less than the given bounds will detect the incompatibility.
