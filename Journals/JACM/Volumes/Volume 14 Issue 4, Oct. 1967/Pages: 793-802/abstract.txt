The time required to perform multiplication is investigated. A lower bound on the time required to perform multiplication, as well as multiplication moduloN, is derived and it is shown that these lower bounds can be approached. Then a lower bound on the amount of time required to perform the most significant part of multiplication (&dlcorn;xy/N&drcorn;) is derived.
