The techniques of automatic programming are useful for constructive proofs in automata theory. A formal definition of an elementary programming language for a stack automaton is given, and it is shown how this may be readily adapted to other classes of automata. The second part of this paper shows how this programming language can be applied to automata theory, as we prove there are non-context-sensitive languages accepted by a stack automaton.
