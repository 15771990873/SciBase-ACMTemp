An algorithm for deriving the primary sequence of a protein or RNA is presented. The data is in the form of short sequences of letters which must be fitted together to form the unknown complete sequence. A computer program for carrying out the steps is described, with an example. It is shown that the algorithm cannot make an error and empirical results are given which illustrate the successful use of the algorithm in reconstructing complete sequences known to be solvable.
