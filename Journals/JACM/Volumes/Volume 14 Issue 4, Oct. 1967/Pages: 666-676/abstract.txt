Given a minimal sequential machineMand a positive integerT, it is desired to partition the state set ofMintoTclasses, sayS0,S1, · · ·,ST-1, such that all states inS1, under all possible inputs, pass into states inSi+1 (modT). If such aT-partition exists,Mcan be realized by means of periodically-varying logic, which often results in the saving of memory elements. The period ofMis defined as the greatest common divisor of all cycle lengths ofM—a quantity which can be readily evaluated since it depends only on a finite set of independent loops exhibited by the state graph.The main result is that aT-partition exists forMif and only ifTis a divisor of the period ofM. For every suchT, an algorithm is given for constructing the corresponding partition. IfMis not required to be minimal, it is shown (constructively) that aT-partition exists for everyT.
