Time and knowledge are studied in synchronous and asynchronous distributed systems. A large class of problems that can be solved using logical clocks as if they were perfectly synchronized clocks is formally characterized. For the same class of problems, a broadcast primitive that can be used as if it achieves common knowledge is also proposed. Thus, logical clocks and the broadcast primitive simplify the task of designing and verifying distributed algorithms: The designer can assume that processors have access to perfectly synchronized clocks and the ability to achieve common knowledge.
