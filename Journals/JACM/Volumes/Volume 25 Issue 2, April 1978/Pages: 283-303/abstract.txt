The method of analysis employing decomposition of busy periods
has, in various forms, been applied to the M/G/1 queueing system
under a variety of scheduling rules This paper extends the
technique of decomposition of busy periods in order to deal with
the M/M/c queueing system. Particular attention is given to a
special busy period referred to as a "delay cycle." The delay cycle
commences with a delay period (of general distribution) in which
jobs arrive but are not serviced, at the conclusion of the delay
period, processing begins and continues until the system is empty.
Closed form solutions are obtained for various entities such as
distribution of busy period length and expected waiting time
conditioned on the type of busy period in progress at the tmae of
job arrival. These results are applied and extended to the analysis
of six examples of multiprocessor systems.
