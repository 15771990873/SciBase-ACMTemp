It is shown that the external path length of a binary tree is closely related to the ratios of means of certain integers and establish the upper boundExternalPathLength≤Nlog2N+D-log2D-0.6623,whereNdenotes the number of external nodes in the tree andDis the difference in length between a longest and shortest path. Then it is proved that this bound is tight up to anONterm ifD≤N. IfD>N, we contstruct binary trees whose external path length is at least as large asNlog2N+fN,DD-log2D-4, wherefN,D=1/1+2D/N.
