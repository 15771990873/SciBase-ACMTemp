It is shown thatn+k-O(1) comparisons are necessary, on average, to find thekth smallest ofnnumbers (k&lne;n/2). This lower bound matches the behavior of the technique of Floyd and Rivest to within a lower-order term. 7n/4 ±o(n) comparisons, on average, are shown to be necessary and sufficient to find the maximum and median of a set. An upper bound of 9n/4 ±o(n) and a lower bound of 2n-o(n) are shown for the max-min-median problem.
