An (N, M, T)-OR-disperser is a bipartite multigraphG=(V, W, E) with |V| =N, and |W| =M, having the following expansion property: any subset ofVhaving at leastTvertices has a neighbor set of size at leastM/2. For any pair of constants &xgr;, &lgr;, 1 ≥ &xgr; > &lgr; ≥ 0, any sufficiently largeN, and for anyT≥ 2(logN)M≤ 2(logN)&lgr;, we give an explicit elementary construction of an (N, M,    T)-OR-disperser such that the out-degree of any vertex inVis at most polylogarithmic inN. Using this with known applications of OR-dispersers yields several results. First, our construction implies that the complexity class Strong-RP defined by Sipser, equals RP. Second, for any fixed &eegr; > 0, we give the first polynomial-time simulation of RP algorithms using the output of any “&eegr;-minimally random” source. For any integralR> 0, such a source accepts a single request for anR-bit string and generates the string according to a distribution that assigns probability at most 2−R&eegr;to any string. It is minimally random in the sense that  any weaker source is insufficient to do a black-box polynomial-time simulation of RP algorithms.
