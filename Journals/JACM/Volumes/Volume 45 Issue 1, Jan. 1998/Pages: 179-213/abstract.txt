We show thatquick hitting set generatorscan replacequick pseudorandom generatorsto derandomize any probabilistictwo-sided erroralgorithms. Up to nowquick hitting set generatorshave been known as the general and uniform derandomization method for probabilisticone-sided erroralgorithms, whilequick pseudorandom generatorsas the generators as the general and uniform method to derandomize probabilistictwo-sided erroralgorithms.Our method is based on a deterministic algorithm that, given a Boolean circuitCand given access to a hitting set generator, constructs adiscrepancy setforC. The main novelty is that the discrepancy set depends onC, so the new derandomization method is not uniform (i.e., notoblivious).The algorithm works in time exponential ink(p(n))wherek(*) is thepriceof the hitting set generator andp(*) is a polynomial function in the size ofC. We thus prove that if a logarithmic price quick hitting set generator exists then BPP = P.
