A finite automatonâ€”the so-called neuromaton, realized by a finite discrete recurrent neural network, working in parallel computation mode, is considered. Both the size of neuromata (i.e., the number of neurons) and their descriptional complexity (i.e., the number of bits in the neuromaton representation) are studied. It is proved that a constraint time delay of the neuromaton output does not play a role within a polynomial descriptional complexity. It is shown that any regular language given by a regular expression of lengthnis recognized by a neuromaton with &THgr;(n) neurons. Further, it is proved that this network size is, in the worst case, optimal. On the other hand, generally there is not an equivalent polynomial length regular     expression for a given neuromaton. Then, two specialized constructions of neural acceptors of the optimal descriptional complexity &THgr;(n) for a singlen-bit string recognition are described. They both requireO(n1/2)neurons and eitherO(n)connections with constant weights orO(n1/2)edges with weights of theO2nHopfield condition stating when a regular language is a Hopfield language, is formulated. A construction of a Hopfield neuromaton is presented for a regular language satisfying the Hopfield    condition. The class of Hopfield languages is shown to be closed under union, intersection, concatenation and complement, and it is not closed under iteration. Finally, the problem whether a regular language given by a neuromaton (or by a Hopfield acceptor) is nonempty, is proved to be PSPACE-complete. As a consequence, the same result for a neuromaton equivalence problem is achieved.
