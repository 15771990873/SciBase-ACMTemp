We give a new characterization of NP: the class NP contains exactly those languagesLfor which membership proofs (a proof that an inputxis inL) can be verified probabilistically in polynomial time usinglogarithmicnumber of random bits and by readingsublogarithmicnumber of bits from the proof.We discuss implications of this characterization; specifically, we show that approximating Clique and Independent Set, even in a very weak sense, is NP-hard.
