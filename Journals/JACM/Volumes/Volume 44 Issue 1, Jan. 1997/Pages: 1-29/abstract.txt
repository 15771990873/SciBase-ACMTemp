A collection ofnballs inddimensions forms ak-ply system if no point in the space is covered by more thankballs. We show that for everyk-ply system &Ggr;, there is a sphereSthat intersects at mostO(k1/dn1−1/d) balls of &Ggr; and divides the remainder of &Ggr; into two parts: those in the interior and those in the exterior of the sphereS, respectively, so that the larger part contains at most (1−1/(d+2))nballs. This bound of   (O(k1/dn1−1/d) is the best possible in bothnandk. We also present a simple randomized algorithm to find such a sphere inO(n)time. Our result implies that everyk-nearest neighbor graphs ofnpoints inddimensions has a separator of sizeO(k1/dn1−1/d). In conjunction with a result of Koebe that every triangulated planar graph is isomorphic to the intersection graph of a disk-packing, our result not only gives a new   geometric proof of the planar separator theorem of Lipton and Tarjan, but also generalizes it to higher dimensions. The separator algorithm can be used for point location and geometric divide and conquer in a fixed dimensional space.
