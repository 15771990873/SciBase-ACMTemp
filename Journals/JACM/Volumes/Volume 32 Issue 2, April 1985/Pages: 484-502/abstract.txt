A projection of a Boolean function is a function obtained by substituting for each of its variables a variable, the negation of a variable, or a constant. Reducibilities among computational problems under this relation of projection are considered. It is shown that much of what is of everyday relevance in Turing-machine-based complexity theory can be replicated easily and naturally in this elementary framework. Finer distinctions about the computational relationships among natural problems can be made than in previous formulations and some negative results are proved.
