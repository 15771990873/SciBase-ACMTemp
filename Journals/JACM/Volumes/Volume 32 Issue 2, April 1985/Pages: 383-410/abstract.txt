This paper analyzes decomposition properties of a graph that, when they occur, permit a polynomial solution of the traveling salesman problem and a description of the traveling salesman polytope by a system of linear equalities and inequalities. The central notion is that of a 3-edge cutset, namely, a set of 3 edges that, when removed, disconnects the graph. Conversely, our approach can be used to construct classes of graphs for which there exists a polynomial algorithm for the traveling salesman problem. The approach is illustrated on two examples, Halin graphs and prismatic graphs.
