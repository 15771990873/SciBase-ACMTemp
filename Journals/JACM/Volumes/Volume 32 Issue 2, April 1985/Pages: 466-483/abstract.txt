Two of the most powerful classes of programs for which interesting decision problems are known to be solvable are the class of finite-memory programs and the class of programs that characterize the Presburger, or semilinear, sets. In this paper, a new class of programs that presents solvable decision problems similar to the other two classes of programs is introduced. However, the programs in the new class are shown to be computationally more powerful (i.e., capable of defining larger sets of input-output relations).
