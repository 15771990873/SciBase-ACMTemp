We describe the application of proof orderingsâ€”a technique for reasoning about inference systems-to various rewrite-based theorem-proving methods, including refinements of the standard Knuth-Bendix completion procedure based on critical pair criteria; Huet's procedure for rewriting modulo a congruence; ordered completion (a refutationally complete extension of standard completion); and a proof by consistency procedure for proving inductive theorems.
