For any fixed dimensiond, the
linear programming problem withninequality constraints can be solved on a probabilistic CRCW PRAM withO(n)
processors almost surely in constant time. The algorithm always finds
the correct solution. Withnd/log2dprocessors, the probability that the algorithm will not finish withinO(d2log2dtime tends to zero exponentially withn.â€”Authors' Abstract
