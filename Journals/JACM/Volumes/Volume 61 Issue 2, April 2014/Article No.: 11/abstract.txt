TheChow parametersof a Boolean functionf:&lcub;−1, 1&rcub;n→ &lcub;−1, 1&rcub; are itsn&plus;1 degree-0 and degree-1 Fourier coefficients. It has been known since 1961 &lsqb;Chow 1961; Tannenbaum 1961&rsqb; that the (exact values of the) Chow parameters of any linear threshold functionfuniquely specifyfwithin the space of all Boolean functions, but until recently &lsqb;O'Donnell and Servedio 2011&rsqb; nothing was known about efficient algorithms forreconstructingf(exactly or approximately) from exact or approximate values of its Chow parameters. We refer to this reconstruction problem as theChow Parameters Problem.Our main result is a new algorithm for the Chow Parameters Problem which, given (sufficiently accurate approximations to) the Chow parameters of any linear threshold functionf, runs in time Õ(n2) ⋅ (1/&epsi;)O(log2(1/&epsi;))and with high probability outputs a representation of an LTFf′ that is &epsi;-close tofin Hamming distance. The only previous algorithm &lsqb;O'Donnell and Servedio 2011&rsqb; had running time poly(n) ⋅ 22Õ(1/&epsi;2).As a byproduct of our approach, we show that for any linear threshold functionfover &lcub;-1, 1&rcub;n, there is a linear threshold functionf′ which is &epsi;-close tofand has all weights that are integers of magnitude at most √n ⋅ (1/&epsi;)O(log2(1/&epsi;)). This significantly improves the previous best result of Diakonikolas and Servedio &lsqb;2009&rsqb; which gave a poly(n) ⋅ 2Õ(1/&epsi;2/3)weight bound, and is close to the known lower bound of max&lcub;√n, (1/&epsi;)Ω(log log (1/&epsi;))&rcub; &lsqb;Goldberg 2006; Servedio 2007&rsqb;. Our techniques also yield improved algorithms for related problems in learning theory.In addition to being significantly stronger than previous work, our results are obtained using conceptually simpler proofs. The two main ingredients underlying our results are (1) a new structural result showing that forfany linear threshold function andgany bounded function, if the Chow parameters offare close to the Chow parameters ofgthenfis close tog; (2) a new boosting-like algorithm that given approximations to the Chow parameters of a linear threshold function outputs a bounded function whose Chow parameters are close to those off.
