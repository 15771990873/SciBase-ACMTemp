The problem of partitioning a polygonal region into a minimum number of trapezoids with two horizontal sides is discussed. A triangle with a horizontal side is considered to be a trapezoid with two horizontal sides one of which is degenerate. First, a method of achieving a minimum partition is presented. The numberM* of the trapezoids in the minimum partition of a polygonal regionPis shown to beM*=n+w-h-d- 1, wheren,w, andhare the number of vertices, windows (holes), and horizontal edges ofP, respectively, anddis the cardinality of a maximum independent set of the straight-lines-in-the-plane graph associated withP. Next, this problem is shown to be polynomially equivalent to the problem of finding a maximum independent set of a straight-lines-in-the-plane graph, and consequently, it is shown to be NP-complete. However, for a polygonal region without windows, anO(n2)-time algorithm for partitioning it into a minimum number of trapezoids is presented. Finally, anO(nlogn)-time approximation algorithm with the performance bound 3 is presented.
