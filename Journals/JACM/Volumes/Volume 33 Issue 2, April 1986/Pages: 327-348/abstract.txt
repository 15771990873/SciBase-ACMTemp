The theory developed in Part I is used to state the mutual exclusion problem and several additional fairness and failure-tolerance requirements. Four “distributed”N-process solutions are given, ranging from a solution requiring only one communication bit per process that permits individual starvation, to one requiring aboutN! communication bits per process that satisfies every reasonable fairness and failure-tolerance requirement that we can conceive of.
