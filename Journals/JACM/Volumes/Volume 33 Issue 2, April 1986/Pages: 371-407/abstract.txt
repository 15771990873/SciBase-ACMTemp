A precise analysis of partial match retrieval of multidimensional data is presented. The structures considered here are multidimensional search trees (k-d-trees) and digital tries (k-d-tries), as well as structures designed for efficient retrieval of information stored on external devices. The methods used include a detailed study of a differential system around a regular singular point in conjunction with suitable contour integration techniques for the analysis ofk-d-trees, and properties of the Mellin integral transform fork-d-tries and extendible cell algorithms.
