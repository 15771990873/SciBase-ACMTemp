We study the problem ofrobust satisfiabilityof systems of nonlinear equations, namely, whether for a given continuous functionf:K→ Rn on a finite simplicial complexKand α>0, it holds that each functiong:K→ Rn such that ║g−f║∞ ≤α, has a root inK. Via a reduction to the extension problem of maps into a sphere, we particularly show that this problem is decidable in polynomial time for every fixedn, assuming dimK≤ 2n−3. This is a substantial extension of previous computational applications oftopological degreeand related concepts in numerical and interval analysis.Via a reverse reduction, we prove that the problem is undecidable when dimK≥ 2n−2, where the threshold comes from thestable rangein homotopy theory.For the lucidity of our exposition, we focus on the setting whenfis simplexwise linear. Such functions can approximate general continuous functions, and thus we get approximation schemes and undecidability of the robust satisfiability in other possible settings.
