A new treatment of the boundary conditions of diffusion
approximations for interconnected queueing systems is presented.
The results have applications to the study of the performance of
multiple-resource computer systems. In this approximation method,
additional equations to represent the behavior of the queues when
they are empty are introduced. This reduces the dependence of the
model on heavy traffic assumptions and yields certain results which
would be expected from queueing or renewal theory. The accuracy of
the approach is evaluated by comparison with certain known exact or
numerical results.
