A generalized multi-entrance and multipriority M/G/1
time-sharing system is dealt with. The system maintains many
separate queues, each identified by two integers, the priority
level and the entry level The arrival process of users is a
homogenous Poisson process, while service requirements are
identically distributed and have a finite second moment. Upon
arrival a user joins one of the levels, through the entry queue of
this level. In the(n, k)-th queue, wherenis the
priority level andkis the entry level, a user is eligible
to a (finite or infinite) quantum of service. If the service
requirements of the user are satisfied during the quantum, the user
departs, and otherwise he is trans- ferred to the end of the(n
+ 1, k)-th queue for additional service. When a quantum of
service is completed, the highest priority nonempty level is chosen
to be served next; within this level the queues are scanned
according to the priority of their entry level, and the user at the
head of the highest priority nonempty queue is chosen to be served.
In such a priority discipline, preferred users always get an
improved service, though the service of all users is degraded in
proportion to their service requirements. Expected flow times and
expected number of waiting users are derived and then specialized
to the head-of-the-line M/G/1 priority discipline (in which quanta
have infinite length and service is uninterrupted) and to the
FBntime-sharing system. Finally, the generalized
multientrance and multipriority time-sharing discipline is
(numerically) compared with several other time-sharing systems.
