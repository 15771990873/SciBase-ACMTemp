We present two new algorithms for solving the All Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP) problem for weighted directed graphs. Both algorithms use fast matrix multiplication algorithms.The first algorithm solves the APSP problem for weighted directed graphs in which the edge weights are integers of small absolute value inÕ(n2+μ) time, where μ satisfies the equation ω(1, μ, 1) = 1 + 2μ and ω(1, μ, 1) is the exponent of the multiplication of ann×nμmatrix by annμ×nmatrix. Currently, the best available bounds on ω(1, μ, 1), obtained by Coppersmith, imply that μ < 0.575. The running time of our algorithm is thereforeO(n2.575). Our algorithm improves on the&Otilede;(n(3c+ω)/2) time algorithm, where ω = ω(1, 1, 1) < 2.376 is the usual exponent of matrix multiplication, obtained by Alon et al., whose running time is only known to beO(n2.688).The second algorithm solves the APSP problemalmostexactly for directed graphs witharbitrarynonnegative real weights. The algorithm runs in Õ((nω/&epsis;) log(W/&epsis;)) time, where &epsis; > 0 is an error parameter andWis the largest edge weight in the graph, after the edge weights are scaled so that the smallest non-zero edge weight in the graph is 1. It returns estimates of all the distances in the graph with a stretch of at most 1 + &epsis;. Corresponding paths can also be found efficiently.
