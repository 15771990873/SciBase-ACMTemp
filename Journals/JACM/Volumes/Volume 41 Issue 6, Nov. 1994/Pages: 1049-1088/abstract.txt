Given an off-line sequenceSofnset-manipulation operations, we investigate the parallel complexity of evaluatingS(i.e., finding the response to every operation inSand returning the resulting set). We show that the problem of evaluatingSis inNCfor various combinations of common set-manipulation operations. Once we establish membership inNC(or, if membership inNCis obvious), we develop techniques for improving the time and/or processor complexity.
