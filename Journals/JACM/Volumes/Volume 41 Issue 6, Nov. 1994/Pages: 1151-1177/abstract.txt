Bottom-up evaluation of deductive database programs has the advantage that it avoids repeated computations by storing all intermediate results and replacing recomputation by table lookup. However, in general, storing all intermediate results for the duration of a computation wastes space. In this paper, we propose an evaluation scheme that avoids recomputation, yet for a fairly general class of programs at any given time stores only a small subset of the facts generated. The results constitute a significant first step in compile-time garbage collection for bottom-up evaluation of deductive database programs.
