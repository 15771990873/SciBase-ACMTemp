LetXbe randomly chosen from {-1,1}n, and letYbe randomly chosen from the standard spherical Gaussian on ℝn. For any (possibly unbounded) polytopePformed by the intersection ofkhalfspaces, we prove that |Pr[X∈P] - Pr[Y∈P]| ≤ log8/5k⋅ Δ, where Δ is a parameter that is small for polytopes formed by the intersection of “regular” halfspaces (i.e., halfspaces with low influence). The novelty of our invariance principle is the polylogarithmic dependence onk. Previously, only bounds that were at least linear inkwere known. The proof of the invariance principle is based on a generalization of the Lindeberg method for proving central limit theorems and could be of use elsewhere.We give two important applications of our invariance principle, one from learning theory and the other from pseudorandomness.(1) A bound of logO(1)k⋅ &epsi;1/6on the Boolean noise sensitivity of intersections ofk“regular” halfspaces (previous work gave bounds linear ink). This gives a corresponding agnostic learning algorithm for intersections of regular halfspaces.(2) A pseudorandom generator (PRG) for estimating the Gaussian volume of polytopes withkfaces within error δ and seed-lengthO(lognpoly(logk,1/δ)).We also obtain PRGs with similar parameters that fool polytopes formed by intersection of regular halfspaces over the hypercube. Using our PRG constructions, we obtain the first deterministic quasi-polynomial time algorithms for approximately counting the number of solutions to a broad class of integer programs, including dense covering problems and contingency tables.
