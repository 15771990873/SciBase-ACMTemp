The communication cost of algorithms (also known as I/O-complexity) is shown to be closely related to the expansion properties of the corresponding computation graphs. We demonstrate this on Strassen's and other fast matrix multiplication algorithms, and obtain the first lower bounds on their communication costs.In the sequential case, where the processor has a fast memory of sizeM, too small to store threen-by-nmatrices, the lower bound on the number of words moved between fast and slow memory is, for a large class of matrix multiplication algorithms, Ω( (n/√M)ω0·M), where ω0is the exponent in the arithmetic count (e.g., ω0= lg 7 for Strassen, and ω0= 3 for conventional matrix multiplication). Withpparallel processors, each with fast memory of sizeM, the lower bound is asymptotically lower by a factor ofp. These bounds are attainable both for sequential and for parallel algorithms and hence optimal.
