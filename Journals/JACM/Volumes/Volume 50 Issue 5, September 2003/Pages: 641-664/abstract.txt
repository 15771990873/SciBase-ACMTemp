We consider the traveling salesman problem when the cities are points in &&num;x211D;dfor some fixeddand distances are computed according to geometric distances, determined by some norm. We show that for any polyhedral norm, the problem of finding a tour ofmaximumlength can be solved in polynomial time. If arithmetic operations are assumed to take unit time, our algorithms run in timeO(nf−2logn), wherefis the number of facets of the polyhedron determining the polyhedral norm. Thus, for example, we haveO(n2logn) algorithms for the cases of points in the plane under the Rectilinear and Sup norms. This is in contrast to the fact that finding aminimumlength tour in each case is NP-hard. Our approach can be extended to the more general case ofquasi-normswith a not necessarily symmetric unit ball, where we get a complexity ofO(n2f−2logn).For the special case of two-dimensional metrics withf= 4 (which includes the Rectilinear and Sup norms), we present a simple algorithm withO(n) running time. The algorithm does not use any indirect addressing, so its running time remains valid even in comparison based models in which sorting requires Ω(nlogn) time. The basic mechanism of the algorithm provides some intuition on why polyhedral norms allow fast algorithms.Complementing the results on simplicity for polyhedral norms, we prove that, for the case of Euclidean distances in &&num;x211D;dford≥ 3, the Maximum TSP is NP-hard. This sheds new light on the well-studied difficulties of Euclidean distances.
