Planar spatial datasets can be modeled by closed semi-algebraic sets in the plane. We establish a characterization of the topological properties of such datasets expressible in the relational calculus with real polynomial constraints. The characterization is in the form of a query language that can only point that can only talk about points in the set and the “cones” around these points.
