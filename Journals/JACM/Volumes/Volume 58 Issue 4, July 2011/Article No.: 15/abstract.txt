The work reported here lays the foundations of data exchange in the presence of probabilistic data. This requires rethinking the very basic concepts of traditional data exchange, such as solution, universal solution, and the certain answers of target queries. We develop a framework for data exchange over probabilistic databases, and make a case for its coherence and robustness. This framework applies to arbitrary schema mappings, and finite or countably infinite probability spaces on the source and target instances. After establishing this framework and formulating the key concepts, we study the application of the framework to a concrete and practical setting where probabilistic databases are compactly encoded by means of annotations formulated over random Boolean variables. In this setting, we study the problems of testing for the existence of solutions and universal solutions, materializing such solutions, and evaluating target queries (for unions of conjunctive queries) in both the exact sense and the approximate sense. For each of the problems, we carry out a complexity analysis based on properties of the annotation, for various classes of dependencies. Finally, we show that the framework and results easily and completely generalize to allow not only the data, but also the schema mapping itself to be probabilistic.
