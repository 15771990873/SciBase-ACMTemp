We consider a fragment of XPath 1.0, where attribute and text values may be compared. We show that for any unary query &varphi; in this fragment, the set of nodes that satisfy the query in a documenttcan be calculated in timeO(&vert;&varphi;&vert;3&vert;t&vert;). We show that for a query in a bigger fragment with Kleene star allowed, the same can be done in timeO(2O(&vert;&varphi;&vert;)&vert;t&vert;) or in timeO(&vert;&varphi;&vert;3&vert;t&vert;log&vert;t&vert;). Finally, we present algorithms for binary queries of XPath, which do a precomputation on the document and then output the selected pairs with constant delay.
