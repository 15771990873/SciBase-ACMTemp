The main result is a characterization of the generating sequences of the length of words in a regular language onksymbols. We say that a sequencesof integers is regular if there is a finite graphGwith two verticesi, tsuch thatsnis the number of paths of lengthnfromitotinG. Thus the generating sequence of a regular language is regular. We prove that a sequencesis the generating sequence of a regular language onksymbols if and only if both sequencess= (sn)n≥0andt= (kn−sn)n≥0are regular.
