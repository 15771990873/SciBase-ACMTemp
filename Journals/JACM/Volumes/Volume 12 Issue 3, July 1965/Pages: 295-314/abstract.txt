Methods are described for the derivation of minimax and near-minimax polynomial approximations. For minimax approximations techniques are considered for both analytically defined functions and functions defined by a table of values. For near-minimax approximations methods of determining the coefficients of the Fourier-Chebyshev expansion are first described. These consist of the rearrangement of the coefficients of a power polynomial, and also direct determination of the coefficients from the integral which defines them, or the differential equation which defines the function. Finally there is given a convenient modification of an interpolation scheme which finds coefficients of a near-minimax approximation without requiring numerical integration or the numerical solution of a system of equations.
