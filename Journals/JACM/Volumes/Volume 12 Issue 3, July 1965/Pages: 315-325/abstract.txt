For the computer to be a tool of the general scientist rather than of the computer specialist it will have to conform to the characteristics of interpersonal communications, since these are rooted in the characteristics of human intelligence. It must not require the scientist to use a language which is formal or which requires special study. It must, like a human assistant, share with each particular employer the labor of establishing a common language and of formulating clear instructions. This shared labor must take the form of a dialog in which the computer asks questions on obscure portions of its instructions. The computer must accept as answers either paraphrases or explanations. It should not need to repeat identical or similar questions. It should choose fundamental or revealing questions; if necessary an employer can encourage this by giving fundamental answers to superficial questions.
