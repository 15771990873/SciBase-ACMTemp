The latent class structure is modified by requiring the number of latent classes to be equal to the number of keywords. This modification changes the latent structure to one that consists of matrices that are both symmetric and positive definite, therefore making a “computer solution” both possible and practical. The modified latent structure is derived, the numerical analysis considerations for a computer solution are presented, and an example illustrates the use of the latent class structure in both file organization and retrieval.
