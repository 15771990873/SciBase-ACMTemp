An algorithm is presented for finding a solution, and the value of a solution, ton+ 1 linear equations innunknowns. The arrangement of the computation makes it convenient for use in computing Chebyshev-type approximations by polynomials. The algorithm is particularly efficient if only the value of a solution is desired.
