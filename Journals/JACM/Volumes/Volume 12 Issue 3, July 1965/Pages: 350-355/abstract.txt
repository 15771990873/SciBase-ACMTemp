A storage or processing device with a fixed number of cells in considered. If a chance-mechanism selects which ofMpersons is to transmit an element of message to the device, the probability is found that the device will be filled without a complete message having been introduced into it. This probability should be useful in determining the “optimum” number of persons who can use the device. The problem is treated as one in anM-dimensional random walk.
