Consider the setHof all linear (or affine) transformations between two vector spaces over a finite fieldF. We study how goodHis as a class of hash functions, namely we consider hashing a setSof sizeninto a range having the same cardinalitynby a randomly chosen function fromHand look at the expected size of the largest hash bucket.His a universal class of hash functions for any finite field, but with respect to our measure different fields behave differently.If the finite  fieldFhasnelements, then there is a bad setSâŠ‚F2of sizenwith expected maximal bucket sizeH(n1/3). Ifnis a perfect square, then there is even a bad set with largest bucket sizealwaysat leastn. (This is worst possible, since with respect to a universal class of hash functions every set of sizenhas expected largest bucket size belown+   1/2.)If, however, we consider the field of  two  elements, then we get much better bounds. The best previously known upper bound on the  expected size of the largest bucket for this class wasO(2log n). We reduce this upper bound toO(lognlog logn). Note that this is not far from the guarantee for a random function. There, the average largest bucket would be &THgr;(logn/ log logn).In the course of our proof we develop a tool which may be of independent interest. Suppose we have a subsetSof a vector spaceDoverZ2, and consider a random linear mapping ofDto a smaller vector spaceR. If the cardinality ofSis larger thanc&egr;|R|log|R|, then with probability 1 - &egr;, the image ofSwill cover all elements in the range.
