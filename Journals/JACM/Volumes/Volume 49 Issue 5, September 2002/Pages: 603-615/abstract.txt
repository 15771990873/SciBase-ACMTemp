Given a collection of contigs and mate-pairs. TheContig Scaffolding Problemis to order and orientate the given contigs in a manner that is consistent with as many mate-pairs as possible. This paper describes an efficient heuristic called thegreedy-path merging algorithmfor solving this problem. The method was originally developed as a key component of thecompartmentalized assemblystrategy developed at Celera Genomics. This interim approach was used at an early stage of the sequencing of the human genome to produce a preliminary assembly based on preliminary whole genome shotgun data produced at Celera and preliminary human contigs produced by the Human Genome Project.
