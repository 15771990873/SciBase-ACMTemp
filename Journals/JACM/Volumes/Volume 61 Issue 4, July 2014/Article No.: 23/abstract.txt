Consider the following two-player communication process to decide a languageL: The first player holds the entire inputxbut is polynomially bounded; the second player is computationally unbounded but does not know any part ofx; their goal is to decide cooperatively whetherxbelongs toLat small cost, where the cost measure is the number of bits of communication from the first player to the second player.For any integerd≥ 3 and positive realε, we show that, if satisfiability forn-variabled-CNF formulas has a protocol of costO(nd−ε), then coNP is in NP/poly, which implies that the polynomial-time hierarchy collapses to its third level. The result even holds when the first player is conondeterministic, and is tight as there exists a trivial protocol forε= 0. Under the hypothesis that coNP is not in NP/poly, our result implies tight lower bounds for parameters of interest in several areas, namely sparsification, kernelization in parameterized complexity, lossy compression, and probabilistically checkable proofs.By reduction, similar results hold for other NP-complete problems. For the vertex cover problem onn-vertexd-uniform hypergraphs, this statement holds for any integerd≥ 2. The cased= 2 implies that no NP-hard vertex deletion problem based on a graph property that is inherited by subgraphs can have kernels consisting ofO(k2 −ε) edges unless coNP is in NP/poly, wherekdenotes the size of the deletion set. Kernels consisting ofO(k2) edges are known for several problems in the class, including vertex cover, feedback vertex set, and bounded-degree deletion.
