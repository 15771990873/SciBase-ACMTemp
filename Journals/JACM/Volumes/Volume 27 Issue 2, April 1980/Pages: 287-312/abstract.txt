An algorithm which schedules forests ofntasks onmidentical processors inO(nlogm) time, offline, is given. The schedules are optimal with respect to finish time and contain at mostn- 2 preemptions, a bound which is realized for alln. Also given is a simpler algorithm which runs inO(nm) time on the same problem and can be adapted to give optimal finish time schedules on-line for independent tasks with release times.
