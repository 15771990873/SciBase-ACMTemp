The cycle time distribution of a cyclic queue with two exponential servers is derived. Results show that when the population sizeNis large enough, the cycle time distribution is not sensitive to the ratio of service rates and asymptotically approaches an Erlangian distribution. If service rates are identical, however, the cycle time has an exact Erlangian distribution for anyN.
