The correctness of semantic-syntax-directed translators (SSDTs) is examined. SSDTs are a generalization of syntax-directed translators in which semantic information is employed to partially direct the translator. Sufficient conditions for an SSDT to be “semantic-preserving,” or “correct,” are presented. A further result shows that unless certain conditions are met, it is undecidable, in general, whether an SSDT is semantic-preserving.
