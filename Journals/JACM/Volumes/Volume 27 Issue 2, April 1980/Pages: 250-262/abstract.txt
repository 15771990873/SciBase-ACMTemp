An algorithm is given for deciding whether a functional or a multivalued dependency&sgr;(with a right-hand sideY) is implied by a set of functional and multivalued dependencies &Sgr;. The running time of the algorithm isO(|Y|&Verbar;&Sgr;&Verbar;), whereYis the number of attributes inYand &Verbar;&Sgr;&Verbar; is the size of the description of &Sgr;. The problem of constructing the dependency basis of a set of attributesXis also investigated. It is shown that the dependency basis can be found inO(S&Verbar;&Sgr;&Verbar;) time, whereSis the number of sets in the dependency basis. Since functional and multivalued dependencies correspond to a subclass of propositional logic (that can be viewed as a generalization of Horn clauses), the algorithm given is also an efficient inference procedure for this subclass of propositional logic.
