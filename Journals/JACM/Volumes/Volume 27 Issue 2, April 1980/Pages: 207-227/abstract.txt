In the bin-packing problem a listLofnnumbers are to be packed into unit-capacity bins. For any algorithmS, letr(S) be the maximum ratioS(L)/L*for largeL*, whereS(L) denotes the number of bins used bySandL*denotes the minimum number needed. An on-line&Ogr;(nlogn)-time algorithm RFF withr(RFF) = 5/3 and an off-line polynomial-time algorithm RFFD withr(RFFD) ≤ 11/9 - &egr; for some fixed &egr; > 0, are given. These are strictly better, respectively, than two prominent algorithms: the First-Fit (FF), which is on-line withr(FF) = 17/10, and the First-Fit-Decreasing (FFD) withr(FFD) = 11/9. Furthermore, it is shown that any on-line algorithmSmust haver(S) ≥ 3/2. The question, “How well can an&ogr;(nlogn)-time algorithm perform?” is also discussed. It is shown that in the generalizedd-dimensional bin packing, any&ogr;(nlogn)-time algorithmSmust haver(S) ≥d.
