We prove that thework function algorithmfor thek-server problem has a competitive ratio at most 2kâˆ’1. Manasse et al. [1988] conjectured that the competitive ratio for thek-server problem is exactlyk(it is trivially at leastk); previously the best-known upper bound was exponential ink. Our proof involves three crucial ingredients: Aquasiconvexity propertyof work functions, aduality lemmathat uses quasiconvexity to characterize the configuration that achieve maximum increase of the work function, and apotential functionthat exploits the duality lemma.
