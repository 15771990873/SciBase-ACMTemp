The Patricia trie is a simple modification of a regular trie. By eliminating unary branching nodes, the Patricia achieves better performance than regular tries. However, the question is: how much on the average is the Patricia better? This paper offers a thorough answer to this question by considering some statistics of the number of nodes examined in asuccessful searchand anunsuccessful searchin the Patricia tries. It is shown that for the Patricia containingnrecords the average of the successful search lengthSnasymptotically becomes 1/h1· lnn+O(1), and the variance ofSnis either varSn=c· lnn+0(1) for an asymmetric Patricia or varSn=0(1) for a symmetric Patricia, whereh1is the entropy of the alphabet over which the Patricia is built andcis an explicit constant. Higher moments ofSnare also assessed. The number of nodes examined in an unsuccessful searchUnis studied only for binary symmetric Patricia tries. We prove that themth moment of the unsuccessful search lengthEUmnsatisfies limn→∞EUmn/logm2n= 1, and the variance ofUnis varUn= 0.87907. These results suggest that Patricia tries are very well balanced trees in the sense that a random shape of Patriciatries resembles the shape of complete trees that are ultimately balanced trees.
