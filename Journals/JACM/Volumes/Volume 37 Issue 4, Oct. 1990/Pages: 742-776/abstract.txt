This paper examines the unification problem in the class ofprimal algebrasand the varieties they generate. An algebra is called primal if every function on its carrier can be expressed just in terms of the basic operations of the algebra. The two-element Boolean algebra is the simplest nontrivial example: Every truth-function can be realized in terms of the basic connectives, for example, negation and conjunction.It is shown that unification in primal algebras is unitary, that is, if an equation has a solution, it has a single most general one. Two unification algorithms, based on equation-solving techniques for Boolean algebras due to Boole and LoÂ¨wenheim, are studied in detail. Applications include certain finite Post algebras and matrix rings over   finite fields. The former are algebraic models for many-valued logics, the latter cover in particular modular arithmetic.Then unification is extended from primal algebras to their direct powers, which leads to unitary unification algorithms covering finite Post algebras, finite, semisimple Artinian rings, and finite, semisimple nonabelian groups.Finally the fact that the variety generated by a primal algebra coincides with the class of its subdirect powers is used. This yields unitary unification algorithms for the equational theories of Post algebras andp-rings.
