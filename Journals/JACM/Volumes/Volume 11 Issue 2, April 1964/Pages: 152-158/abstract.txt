The purpose of this paper is to consider the limiting conditions associated with the handling of many unrelated input data sources by a digital computer which utilizes binary internal logic. Equations are derived which relate the number of distinct input sources to their frequency through inequalities which specify the limiting conditions, i.e. the maximum number of data sources for a given input data frequency. Inequalities are derived for both serial and parallel input data configurations. The limiting conditions for real-time queuing are derived.The modification of the above conditions when program operations are taken into account is examined, and the information content associated with the limiting conditions is discussed. The absolute limit on computer capacity is derived by considering the limit on the information which can be stored in a given computer. Finally, theoretical conclusions are applied to an exemplary model.
