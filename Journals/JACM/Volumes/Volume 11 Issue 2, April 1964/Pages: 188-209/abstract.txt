The orderpwhich is obtainable with a stablek-step method in the numerical solution ofy′=f(x,y) is limited top=k+ 1 by the theorems of Dahlquist. In the present paper the customary schemes are modified by including the value of the derivative at one “nonstep point;” as usual, this value is gained from an explicit predictor. It is shown that the order of these generalized predictor-corrector methods is not subject to the above restrictions; stablek-step schemes withp= 2k+ 2 have been constructed fork≤ 4. Furthermore it is proved that methods of orderpactually converge likehpuniformly in a given interval of integration. Numerical examples give some first evidence of the power of the new methods.
