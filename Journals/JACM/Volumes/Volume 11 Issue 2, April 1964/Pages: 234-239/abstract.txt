A method for computing an analysis of variance from an algebraic specification of the statistical model is described. The model is written in a form consistent with usual statistical notation but also suitable for computer input and logical manipulation. Calculations necessary to obtain the analysis of variance are then determined by the model. An outline of the computational procedure is given.
