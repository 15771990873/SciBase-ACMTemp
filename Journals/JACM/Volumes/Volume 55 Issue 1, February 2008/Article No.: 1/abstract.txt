Aq-query Locally Decodable Code (LDC) encodes ann-bit messagexas anN-bit codewordC(x), such that one can probabilistically recover any bitxiof the message by querying onlyqbits of the codewordC(x), even after some constant fraction of codeword bits has been corrupted.We give new constructions of three query LDCs of vastly shorter length than that of previous constructions. Specifically, given any Mersenne primep&equals; 2t− 1, we design three query LDCs of lengthN&equals; exp(O(n1/t)), for everyn. Based on the largest known Mersenne prime, this translates to a length of less than exp(O(n10− 7)) compared to exp(O(n1/2)) in the previous constructions. It has often been conjectured that there are infinitely many Mersenne primes. Under this conjecture, our constructions yield three query locally decodable codes of lengthN&equals; exp(nO(1/log logn)) for infinitely manyn.We also obtain analogous improvements for Private Information Retrieval (PIR) schemes. We give 3-server PIR schemes with communication complexity ofO(n10− 7) to access ann-bit database, compared to the previous best scheme with complexityO(n1/5.25). Assuming again that there are infinitely many Mersenne primes, we get 3-server PIR schemes of communication complexitynO(1/log logn)) for infinitely manyn.Previous families of LDCs and PIR schemes were based on the properties of low-degree multivariate polynomials over finite fields. Our constructions are completely different and are obtained by constructing a large number of vectors in a small dimensional vector space whose inner products are restricted to lie in an algebraically nice set.
