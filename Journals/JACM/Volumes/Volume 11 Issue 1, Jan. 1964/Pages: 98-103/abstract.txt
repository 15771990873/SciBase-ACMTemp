An algorithm is presented which differs from previous methods by being more adapted for searching over wide frequency ranges and which permits the estimation of spectral density as a function of time as well as of frequency. The algorithm may offer economy, especially on smaller computers. The algorithm is based on the analogy between a broadly tuned filter and a truncated cross correlation.
