Two pseudo-random number generators are considered, the multiplicative congruential method and the mixed congruential method. Some properties of the generated sequences are derived, and several algorithms are developed for the evaluation ofxi= @@@@(i) andi=f-1(xiis theith element of a pseudo-random number sequence.
