SNOBOL is a programming language for the manipulation of strings of symbols. A statement in the SNOBOL language consists of a rule that operates on symbolically named strings. The basic operations are string formation, pattern matching and replacement. Facilities for integer arithmetic, indirect referencing, and input-output are included. In the design of the language, emphasis has been placed on a format that is simple and intuitive. SNOBOL has been implemented for the IBM 7090.
