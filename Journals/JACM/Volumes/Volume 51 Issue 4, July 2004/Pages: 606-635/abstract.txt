We present a general technique for approximating various descriptors of the extent of a setPofnpoints in Rdwhen the dimensiondis an arbitrary fixed constant. For a given extent measure μ and a parameter &epsiv; > 0, it computes in timeO(n+ 1/&epsiv;O(1)) a subsetQ⊆Pof size 1/&epsiv;O(1), with the property that (1 − &epsiv;)μ(P) ≤ μ(Q) ≤ μ(P). The specific applications of our technique include &epsiv;-approximation algorithms for (i) computing diameter, width, and smallest bounding box, ball, and cylinder ofP, (ii) maintaining all the previous measures for a set of moving points, and (iii) fitting spheres and cylinders through a point setP. Our algorithms are considerably simpler, and faster in many cases, than previously known algorithms.
