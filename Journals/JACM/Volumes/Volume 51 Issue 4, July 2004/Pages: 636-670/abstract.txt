By aswitch graph, we mean an undirected graphG= (P&cupdot;W,E) such that all vertices inP(theplugs) have degree one and all vertices inW(theswitches) have even degrees. We callGplaneifGis planar and can be embedded such that all plugs are in the outer face. Given a set (s1,t1), …,(sk,tk) of pairs of plugs, the problem is to find edge-disjoint pathsp1, …,pksuch that everypiconnectssiwithti. The best asymptotic worst-case complexity known so far is quadratic in the number of vertices. In this article, a linear, and thus asymptotically optimal, algorithm is introduced. This result may be viewed as a concluding "keystone" for a number of previous results on various special cases of the problem.
