Given a functionfas an oracle, the collision problem is to find two distinct indexesiandjsuch thatf(i) =f(j), under the promise that such indexes exist. Since the security of many fundamental cryptographic primitives depends on the hardness of finding collisions, our lower bounds provide evidence for the existence of cryptographic primitives that are immune to quantum cryptanalysis. We prove that any quantum algorithm for finding a collision in anr-to-one function must evaluate the function Ω((n/r)1/3) times, wherenis the size of the domain andr|n. This matches an upper bound of Brassard, Høyer, and Tapp. No lower bound better than constant was previously known. Our result also implies a quantum lower bound of Ω(n2/3) queries for the element distinctness problem, which is to determine whethernintegers are all distinct. The best previous lower bound was Ω(&sqrt;n) queries.
