Let @@@@ be an integral domain, P(@@@@) the integral domain of polynomials over @@@@. LetP,Q∈ P(@@@@) withm@@@@ deg (P) ≥n= deg (Q) > 0. LetMbe the matrix whose determinant defines the resultant ofPandQ. LetMijbe the submatrix ofMobtained by deleting the lastjrows ofPcoefficients, the lastjrows ofQcoefficients and the last 2j+1 columns, excepting columnm—n—i—j(0 ≤i≤j<n). The polynomialRj(x) = ∑ii=0det (Mij)xiis thej-t subresultantofPandQ,R0being the resultant. 
Ifb= £(Q), the leading coefficient ofQ, then exist uniquelyR,S∈ P(@@@@) such thatbm-n+1P=QS+Rwith deg (R) <n; define R(P,Q) =R.  DefinePi∈ P(F),Fthe quotient field of @@@@, inductively:P1=P,P2=Q,P3= RP1,P2Pi-2= R(Pi,Pi+1)/c&dgr;i-1+1ifori≥2andni+1> 0, whereci= £(Pi),ni= deg (Pi) and &dgr;i=ni—ni+1.P1,P2, …,Pk, fork≥ 3, is called areduced polynomial remainder sequence. Some of the main results are: (1)Pi∈  P(@@@@) for 1 ≤i≤k; (2)Pk= ±AkRnk-1-1, whenAk= &Pgr;k-2i-2c&dgr;i-1(&dgr;i-1)i; (3)c&dgr;k-1-1kPk= ±Ak+1Rnk; (4)Rj= 0 fornk<j<nk-1— 1. Taking @@@@ to be the integersI, or Pr(I), these results provide new algorithms for computing resultant or greatest common divisors of univariate or multivariate polynomials. Theoretical analysis and extensive testing on a high-speed computer show the new g.c.d. algorithm to be faster than known algorithms by a large factor. When applied to bivariate polynomials, for example this factor grows rapidly with the degree and exceeds 100 in practical cases.
