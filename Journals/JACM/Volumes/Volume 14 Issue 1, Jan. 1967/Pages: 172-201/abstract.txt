Compilation consists of two parts, recognition and translation. A mathematical model is presented which embodies salient features of many modern compiling techniques. The model, called the stack automaton, has the desirable feature of being deterministic in nature. This deterministic device is generalized to a nondeterministic device (nondeterministic stack automaton) and particular instances of this more general device are noted. Sets accepted by nondeterministic stack automata are recursive. Each set accepted by a deterministic linear bounded automaton is accepted by some nonerasing stack automaton. Each context-sensitive language is accepted by some (deterministic) stack automaton.
