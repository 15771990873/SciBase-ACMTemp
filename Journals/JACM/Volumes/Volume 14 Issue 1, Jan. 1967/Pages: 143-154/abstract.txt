A new class of multistep formulas with variable coefficients is derived for the numerical integration of the ordinary differential equationyâ€² =f(x,y) whose theoretical solution possesses a singularity. A first numerical solution is obtained along with estimates for the behavior of the singularity, and these estimates are then used to obtain further numerical solutions.
