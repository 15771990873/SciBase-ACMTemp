Many sequences are most efficiently generated on a digital computer with a sieving procedure in which one represents in the main memory of the machine a set of elements known to contain the desired sequence and then systematically sieves out elements not in the desired sequence. In this expository paper, the technical aspects of programming such sieves are discussed. Special attention is given to the most efficient methods of representing sets in the main memory of the machine as well as the programming difficulties encountered when sieving on these sets. The paper concludes with a discussion of four examples in which sieving procedures were employed.
