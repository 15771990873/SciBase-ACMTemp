A method of analysis of uniform random number generators is developed, applicable to almost all practical methods of generation. The method is that of Fourier analysis of the output sequences of such generators. With this tool it is possible to understand and predict relevant statistical properties of such generators and compare and evaluate such methods. Many such analyses and comparisons have been carried out. The performance of these methods as implemented on differing computers is also studied. The main practical conclusions of the study are: (a) Such a priori analysis and prediction of statistical behavior of uniform random number generators is feasible. (b) The commonly used multiplicative congruence method of generation is satisfactory with careful choice of the multiplier for computers with an adequate (≥ ∼ 35-bit) word length. (c) Further work may be necessary on generators to be used on machines of shorter word length.
