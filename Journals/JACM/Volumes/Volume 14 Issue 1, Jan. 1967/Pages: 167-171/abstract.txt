LetN(T) be the normal system of Post which corresponds to the Thue system,T, as in Martin Davis,Computability and Unsolvability(McGraw-Hill, New York, 1958), pp. 98-100. It is proved that for any recursively enumerable degree of unsolvability,D, there exists a normal system,NT(D), such that the decision problem forNT(D)is of degreeD. Define a generalized normal system as a normal system without initial assertion. For such aGNthe decision problem is to determine for any enunciationsAandBwhether or notAandBare equivalent inGN. Thus the generalized system corresponds more naturally to algebraic problems. It is proved that for any recursively enumerable degree of unsolvability,D, there exists a generalized normal system,GNT(D), such that the decision problem forGNT(D), such that the decision problem forGNT(D)is of degreeD.
