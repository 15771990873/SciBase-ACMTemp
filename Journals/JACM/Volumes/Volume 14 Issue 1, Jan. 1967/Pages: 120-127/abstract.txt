This paper discusses a set of polynomials, {&phgr;r(s)}, orthogonal over a discrete range, with binomial distribution,b(s;n,p), as the weighting function. Two recurrence relations are derived. One expresses &phgr;rin terms of &phgr;r-1and &Dgr;&phgr;r-1, while the other relates &phgr;rwith &phgr;r-1and &phgr;r-2. It is shown that these polynomials are solutions of a finite difference equation. Also considered are two special cases. The first is the set of Hermite polynomials derived as a limiting case of the binomial-weighted orthogonal polynomials. The second deals with the Poisson distribution used as the weighting function.
