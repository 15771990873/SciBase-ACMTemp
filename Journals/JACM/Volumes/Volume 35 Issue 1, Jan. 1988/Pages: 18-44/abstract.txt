T. Parsons originally proposed and studied the following pursuit-evasion problem on graphs: Members of a team of searchers traverse the edges of a graphGin pursuit of a fugitive, who moves along the edges of the graph with complete knowledge of the locations of the pursuers. What is the smallest numbers(G) of searchers that will suffice for guaranteeing capture of the fugitive? It is shown that determining whethers(G) ≤K, for a given integerK, is NP-complete for general graphs but can be solved in linear time for trees. We also provide a structural characterization of those graphsGwiths(G) ≤KforK= 1, 2, 3.
