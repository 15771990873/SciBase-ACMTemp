A large class of relational database update transactions is investigated with respect to equivalence and optimization. The transactions are straight-line programs with inserts, deletes, and modifications using simple selection conditions. Several basic results are obtained. It is shown that transaction equivalence can be decided in polynomial time. A number of optimality criteria for transactions are then proposed, as well as two normal forms. Polynomial-time algorithms for transaction optimization and normalization are exhibited. Also, an intuitively appealing system of axioms for proving transaction equivalence is introduced. Finally, a simple, natural subclass of transactions, called strongly acyclic, is shown to have particularly desirable properties.
