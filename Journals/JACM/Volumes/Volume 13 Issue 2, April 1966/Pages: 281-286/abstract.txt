When is a setAof positive integers, represented as binary numbers, “regular” in the sense that it is a set of sequences that can be recognized by a finite-state machine? Let &pgr;A(n) be the number of members ofAless than the integern. It is shown that the asymptotic behavior of &pgr;A(n) is subject to severe restraints ifAis regular. These constraints are violated by many important natural numerical sets whose distribution functions can be calculated, at least asymptotically. These include the setPof prime numbers for which &pgr;P(n) @@@@n/lognfor largen, the set of integersA(k) of the formnkfor which &pgr;A(k)n) @@@@nP/k, and many others. The technique cannot, however, yield a decision procedure for regularity since for every infinite regular setAthere is a nonregular setA′for which | &pgr;A(n) — &pgr;A′(n) | ≤ 1, so that the asymptotic behaviors of the two distribution functions are essentially identical.
