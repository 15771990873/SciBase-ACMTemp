Discrete sequential systems, such as sampled data systems, discrete Markov processes, linear shift register generators, computer programs, sequential code generators, and prefixed comma-free codes, can be represented and studied in a uniform manner by directed graphs and their generating functions. In this paper the properties of the generating functions are examined from certain connectivity considerations of these graphs.
