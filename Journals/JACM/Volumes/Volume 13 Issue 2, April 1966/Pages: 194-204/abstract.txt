BE VISION is a package of FORTRAN programs for drawing orthographic views of combinations of plane and quadric surfaces. As input, the package takes rectangular coordinate equations specifying the surfaces plus a three-angle specification of the viewing direction. Output is a drawing on the Stromberg Carlson 4020 Microfilm Recorder. Many views of one scene may be obtained simply by changing the viewpoint.The various subroutines of the package and their functions are described in this paper. It also gives numerous examples of pictures that were produced by BE VISION. The package has been in use since April 1964.
