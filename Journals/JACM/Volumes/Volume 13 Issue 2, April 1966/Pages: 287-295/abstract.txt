Linear initial value problems, particularly involving first order differential equations, can be transformed into systems of higher order and treated as boundary value problems. The type of difference equations used to replace the associated second order boundary value problem areyn- 2yn+1+yn+2=h2∑&bgr;iy″n+i+h3; ∑&dgr;iy&tprime;n+i+ · · ·,n= 1, 2, · · ·,N- 1 and -yN+yN+1=h(b0y′N+b1y′N+1) +h2;(c0y″N+c1y″N+1) + · · ·.Numerical techniques referred to asM1,M2, andM3 have been developed in which error isO(h4),O(h6) andO(h8), respectively. Experimental results have been given to demonstrate the usefulness of methodM3 overM1 orM2.
