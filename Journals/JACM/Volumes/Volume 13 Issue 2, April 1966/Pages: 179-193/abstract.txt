Results are obtained for a model of many processors operating in series. The results are obtained directly by recognizing that a sequential processing may be viewed as a cyclic queue. Exact results are given for two sequential processing stages with a buffer storage of arbitrary size between the stages, and approximate results for the case of 2M(Man integer) stages. The analysis is good only for exponentially distributed computation times.
