A one-normal system is a Post production system on a finite alphabet {s1,s2, · · ·,s&sgr;} with productionssiP→PEij, whereiranges over a subset of {1, 2, · · ·, &sgr;} and, for fixedi,jtakes on the values 1, 2, · · ·,ni. The following derivability problem is shown to be solvable for each such system: Given two wordsPandQ, decide whetherQcan be derived fromPby successive applications of the production rules. The result was proved by Hao Wang for the monogenic case (i.e., when eachni= 1).
