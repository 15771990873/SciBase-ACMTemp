The method of reducing a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind to a matrix equation and then inverting the matrix is well suited to a machine computation. The number of the dimension of the matrix equation is desired to be large for a well approximated solution. However, much computing time may be required to invert the matrix or the number of the elements of the matrix may exceed the memory capacity. A successive iterative method is suggested to avoid these difficulties.
