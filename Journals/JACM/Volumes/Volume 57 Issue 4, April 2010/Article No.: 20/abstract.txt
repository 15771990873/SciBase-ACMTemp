We present new explicit constructions ofdeterministicrandomness extractors, dispersers and related objects. We say that a distributionXon binary strings of lengthnis a δ-source ifXassigns probability at most 2−δnto any string of lengthn. For every δ>0, we construct the following poly(n)-time computable functions:2-source disperser:D:({0, 1}n)2→ {0, 1} such that for any two independent δ-sourcesX1,X2we have that the support ofD(X1,X2) is {0, 1}.Bipartite Ramsey graph:LetN&equals;2n. A corollary is that the functionDis a 2-coloring of the edges ofKN,N(the complete bipartite graph over two sets ofNvertices) such that any induced subgraph of sizeNδbyNδis not monochromatic.3-source extractor:E:({0, 1}n)3→ {0, 1} such that for any three independent δ-sourcesX1,X2,X3we have thatE(X1,X2,X3) iso(1)-close to being an unbiased random bit.No previous explicit construction was known for either of these for any δ<1/2, and these results constitute significant progress to long-standing open problems.A component in these results is a new construction of condensers that may be of independent interest: This is a functionC:{0, 1}n→ ({0, 1}n/c)d(wherecanddare constants that depend only on δ) such that for every δ-sourceXone of the output blocks ofC(X)is (exponentially close to) a 0.9-source. (This result was obtained independently by Ran Raz.)The constructions are quite involved and use as building blocks other new and known objects. A recurring theme in these constructions is that objects that were designed to work with independent inputs, sometimes perform well enough with correlated, high entropy inputs.The construction of the disperser is based on a new technique which we call “the challenge-response mechanism” that (in some sense) allows “identifying high entropy regions” in a given pair of sources using only one sample from the two sources.
