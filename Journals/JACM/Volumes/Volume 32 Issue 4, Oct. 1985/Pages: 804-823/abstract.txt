The problem of simulating a synchronous network by an asynchronous network is investigated. A new simulation technique, referred to as a synchronizer, which is a new, simple methodology for designing efficient distributed algorithms in asynchronous networks, is proposed. The synchronizer exhibits a trade-off between its communication and time complexities, which is proved to be within a constant factor of the lower bound.
