In a distributed system, one strategy for achieving mutual exclusion of groups of nodes without communication is to assign to each node a number of votes. Only a group with a majority of votes can execute the critical operations, and mutual exclusion is achieved because at any given time there is at most one such group. A second strategy, whichappearsto be similar to votes, is to define a priori a set of groups that intersect each other. Any group of nodes that finds itself in this set can perform the restricted operations. In this paper, both of these strategies are studied in detail and it is shown that they arenotequivalent in general (although they are in some cases). In doing so, a number of other interesting properties are proved. These properties will be of use to a system designer who is selecting a vote assignment or a set of groups for a specific application.
