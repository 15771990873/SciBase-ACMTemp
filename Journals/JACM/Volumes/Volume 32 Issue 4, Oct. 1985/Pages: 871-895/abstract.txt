It has been a challenge for mathematicians to confirm theoretically the extremely good performance of simplex-type algorithms for linear programming. In this paper the average number of steps performed by a simplex algorithm, the so-calledself-dual method, is analyzed. The algorithm is not started at the traditional point (1, … , l)T, but points of the form (1, &egr;, &egr;2, …)T, with &egr; sufficiently small, are used. The result is better, in two respects, than those of the previous analyses. First, it is shown that the expected number of steps is bounded between two quadratic functionsc1(min(m,n))2andc2(min(m,n))2of thesmallerdimension of the problem. This should be compared with the previous two major results in the field. Borgwardt proves an upper bound ofO(n4m1/(n-1)) under a model that implies that the zero vector satisfies all the constraints, and also the algorithm under his consideration solves only problems from that particular subclass. Smale analyzes the self-dual algorithm starting at (1, … , 1)T. He shows that for any fixedmthere is a constantc(m) such the expected number of steps is less thanc(m)(lnn)m(m+1)
