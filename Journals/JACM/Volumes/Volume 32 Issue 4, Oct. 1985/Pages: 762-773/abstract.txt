A parallel algorithm is presented that accepts as input a graphGand produces a maximal independent set of vertices inG. On a P-RAM without the concurrent write or concurrent read features, the algorithm executes inO((logn)4) time and usesO((n/(logn))3) processors, wherenis the number of vertices inG. The algorithm has several novel features that may find other applications. These include the use of balanced incomplete block designs to replace random sampling by deterministic sampling, and the use of a “dynamic pigeonhole principle” that generalizes the conventional pigeonhole principle.
