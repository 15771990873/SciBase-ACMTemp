From an arbitrary Turing machine,Z, a monogenic Post normal system,v(Z), is constructed. It is then shown not only that the halting problem forZis reducible to that ofv(Z) but also that the halting problem forv(Z) is reducible to that ofZ. Since these two halting problems are of the same degree, the halting problem for the normal system can have an arbitrary (recursively enumerable) degree of undecidability.
