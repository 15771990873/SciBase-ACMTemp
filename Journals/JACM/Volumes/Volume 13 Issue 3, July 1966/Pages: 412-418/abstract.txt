Conventional shift counters are shown to be a special case of the general class of counters that use single-ended information on all but one bit position ofJKflip-flops. The resultant class of counters preserves the autocorrelation characteristics necessary for pseudo-random number generation while allowing a saving in the physical mechanization of a given characteristic equation. A companion matrix in canonical form is developed that yields a direct mapping from the characteristic equation to the requisite logic on each flip-flop.
