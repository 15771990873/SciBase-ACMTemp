Various elementary operations are studied to find whether they preserve on ambiguity and inherent ambiguity of language (“language” means “context-free language”) The following results are established:IfLis an unambiguous language andSis a generalized sequential machine, then (a)S(L) is an unambiguous language ifSis one-to-one onL, and (b)S-1(L) is an unambiguous language.Inherent ambiguity is preserved by every generalized sequential machine which is one-to-one on the set of all words.The product (either left or right) of a language and a word preserves both unambiguity and inherent ambiguity.Neither unambiguity nor inherent ambiguity is preserved by any of the following language preserving operations: (a) one state complete sequential machine; (b) product by a two-element set; (c)Init(L) = [u≠ dur inLfor somev]; (d)Subw(L) = [w≠ durr inLfor someu,v].
