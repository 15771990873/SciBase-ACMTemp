The design of an abstract machine with a recursive function programming language which avoids the predicate type of conditional is described. It is shown that trough the adoption of list processing techniques it has been possible to construct a simple simulator for the machine in FORTRAN. A program for the machine which causes it to perform symbolic differentiation with some algebraic manipulation of the expressions concerned is given as an example of the type of computations which may be performed.
