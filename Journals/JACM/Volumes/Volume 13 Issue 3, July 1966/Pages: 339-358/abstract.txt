This paper begins with a brief description of desicion tables, and then presents a discussion of alternative expressions for them as sequential testing procedures for computer implementation and as Boolean functions. An algorithm is developed which, in a finite number of steps, will convert any given limited entry decision table into an “optimal” computer program, one with minimum average processing time. The algorithm is more general than procedures previously developed and guarantees optimality of the resultant computer program. Previous procedures required two distinct steps and gave no assurance of overall optimality. Computer implementation of the algorithm is also discussed.
