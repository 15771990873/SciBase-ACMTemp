A method is proposed for internal sorting which has the property that the expected time required per record, to sortnrecords with random keys, is a bounded function ofn. Moreover the storage required in addition to that for the records is only 2naddress fields. It appears that the method may be a good choice when the number of records to be sorted is of the order of 10,000 or more.The method consists of partially sorting the records by a radix sort and completing the sort by sifting. In the radix sort, a list type of structure is used to present the distribution of the records.
