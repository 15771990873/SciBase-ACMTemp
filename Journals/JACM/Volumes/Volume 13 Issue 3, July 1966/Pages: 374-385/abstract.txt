Some new predictors are presented for use with the Adams-Moulton correctors of orders 4 through 8. The resulting algorithms have better stability characteristics than the usual ones which employ the Adams Bashforth predictors and at the same time require no additional storage. The regions of absolute and relative stability for the methods mentioned above and for the iterated Adams-Moulton correctors are given. Results obtained using the various methods are compared.
