We propose and analyze a simple new randomized algorithm, called ResolveSat, for finding satisfying assignments of Boolean formulas in conjunctive normal form. The algorithm consists of two stages: a preprocessing stage in which resolution is applied to enlarge the set of clauses of the formula, followed by a search stage that uses a simple randomized greedy procedure to look for a satisfying assignment. Currently, this is the fastest known probabilistic algorithm fork-CNF satisfiability fork&geq; 4 (with a running time ofO(20.5625n) for 4-CNF). In addition, it is the fastest known probabilistic algorithm fork-CNF,k&geq; 3, that have at most one satisfying assignment (uniquek-SAT) (with a running timeO(2(2 ln 2 − 1)n&plus;o(n)) &equals;O(20.386 …n) in the case of 3-CNF). The analysis of the algorithm also gives an upper bound on the number of the codewords of a code defined by ak-CNF. This is applied to prove a lower bounds on depth 3 circuits accepting codes with nonconstant distance. In particular we prove a lower bound Ω(21.282…√>i<n>/i<) for an explicitly given Boolean function ofnvariables. This is the first such lower bound that is asymptotically bigger than 2√>i<n>/i< &plus;o(√>i<n>/i<).
