The problem of finding a minimumk-basis of graphGis that of selecting as small a setBof vertices as possible such that every vertex ofGis at distancekor less from some vertex inB. Cockayne, Goodman, and Hedetniemi previously developed a linear algorithm to find a minimum 1-basis (a minimum dominating set) whenGis a tree. In this paper thek-basis problem is placed in a more general setting, and a linear algorithm is presented that solves the problem for any forest.
