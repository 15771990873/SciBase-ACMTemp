The expected depth of each key in the set of binary search trees formed from all sequences composed from a multiset {p1· 1,p2· 2,p3· 3, ···,pn·n} is obtained, and hence the expected weight of such trees. The expected number of left-to-right local minima and the expected number of cycles in sequences composed from a multiset are then deduced from these results.
