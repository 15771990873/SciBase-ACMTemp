A natural, and readily computable, first guess at a solution to the coin changing problem is the canonical solution. This solution is a special case of the greedy solution which is a reasonable heuristic guess for the knapsack problem. In this paper, efficient tests are given to determine whether all greedy solutions are optimal with respect to a given set of knapsack objects or coin types. These results improve or extend previous tests given in the literature. Both the incomplete and complete cases are considered.
