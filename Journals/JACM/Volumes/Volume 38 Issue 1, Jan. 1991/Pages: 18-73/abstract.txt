The problem of determining shortest paths through a weighted planar polygonal subdivision withnvertices is considered. Distances are measured according to a weighted Euclidean metric: The length of a path is defined to be the weighted sum of (Euclidean) lengths of the subpaths within each region. An algorithm that constructs a (restricted) “shortest path map” with respect to a given source point is presented. The output is a partitioning of each edge of the subdivion into intervals of &egr;-optimality, allowing an &egr;-optimal path to be traced from the source to any query point along any edge. The algorithm runs in worst-case timeO(ES) and requiresO(E) space, whereEis  the number of “events” in our algorithm andSis the time it takes to run a numerical search procedure. In the worst case,Eis bounded above byO(n4) (and we give an &OHgr;(n4) lower bound), but it is likeky thatEwill be much smaller in practice. We also show thatSis bounded byO(n4L), whereLis the precision of the problem instance (including the number of bits in the user-specified tolerance &egr;). Again, the value ofSshould be smaller in practice. The algorithm applies the “continuous  Dijkstra” paradigm  and exploits the fact that shortest paths obey Snell's Law of Refraction at region boundaries, a   local optimaly property of shortest paths that is well known from the analogous optics model. The algorithm generalizes to the multi-source case to compute Voronoi diagrams.
