A technology-independent framework is established for measuring theswitching energyconsumed by very
large scale integrated (VLSI) circuits. Techniques are developed for
analyzing functional energy consumption, and for designing
energy-efficient VLSI circuits. A wire (or gate) in a circuit uses
switching energy when it changes state from 1 to 0 or vice versa. This
paper develops theUniswitch Model
(USM)of energy consumption, which measures the
differences between pairs of states of an embedded
circuit.…—From the Author's Abstract
