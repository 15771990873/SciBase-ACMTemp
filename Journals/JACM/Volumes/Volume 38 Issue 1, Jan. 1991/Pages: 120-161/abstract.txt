A simple characterization of independent database schemes is proved. An algorithm is given for translating a tableauT, posed as a query on a representative instance, to a union of tableaux that is equivalent toT, but can be applied directly to database relations. The algorithm may take exponential time (in the size ofTand the database scheme), and it is applicable only to independent database schemes. IfTis a just a projection of a representative instance, then the algorithm has a simpler form (which is still exponential in the worst case) and is polynomial in some cases.
