Randomized, optimal algorithms to find a partition of the plane induced by a set of algebraic segments of a bounded degree, and a set of linear chains of a bounded degree, are given. This paper also provides a new technique for clipping, calledvirtual clipping, whose overhead per windowWdepends logarithmically on the number if intersections between the borders ofWand the input segments.  In contrast, the overhead of the conventional clipping technique depends linearly on this number of intersections. As an application of virtual clipping, a new simple and efficient algorithm for plannar point location is given.
