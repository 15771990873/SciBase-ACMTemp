A randomized polynomial-time algorithm for approximating the volume of a convex bodyKinn-dimensional Euclidean space is presented. The proof of correctness of the algorithm relies on recent theory of rapidly mixing Markov chains and isoperimetric inequalities to show that a certain random walk can be used to sample nearly uniformly from withinK.
