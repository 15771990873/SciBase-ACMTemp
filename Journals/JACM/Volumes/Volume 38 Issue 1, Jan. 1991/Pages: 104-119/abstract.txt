In many computing applications, there are several equivalent algorithms capable of performing a particular task, and no one is the most efficient under all statistical distributions of the data. In such contexts, a good heuristic is to take a sample of the database and use it to guess which procedure is likely to be the most efficient. This paper defines the very general notion of a differentiable query problem and shows that the ideal sample size for guessing the optimal choice of algorithm isO(N2/3) for all differential problems involving approximatelyNexecuting steps.
