An algorithm is presented for generating a succinct encoding of all pairs shortest path information in a directed planar graphGwith real-valued edge costs but no negative cycles. The algorithm runs inO(pn) time, wherenis the number of vertices inG, andpis the minimum cardinality of a subset of the faces that cover all vertices, taken over all planar embeddings ofG. The algorithm is based on a decomposition of the graph intoO(pn) outerplanar subgraphs satisfying certain separator properties. Linear-time algorithms are presented for various subproblems including that of finding an appropriate embedding ofGand a corresponding face-on-vertex covering of cardinalityO(p), and of generating all pairs shortest path information in a directed outerplannar graph.
