In therenamingtask,n+1 processes start with unique input names from a large space and must choose unique output names taken from a smaller name space, 0,1,…,K. To rule out trivial solutions, a protocol must beanonymous: the value chosen by a process can depend on its input name and on the execution, but not on the specific process ID.Attiya et al. [1990] showed that renaming has a wait-free solution whenK≥ 2n. Several algebraic topology proofs of a lower bound stating that no such protocol exists whenK< 2nhave been published. In a companion article, we present the first completely combinatorial renaming lower bound proof stating ifn+ 1 is a primer power, then renaming is not wait-free solvable whenK< 2n. In this article, we show that ifn+ 1 is not a primer power, then there exists a wait-free renaming protocol forK&equals; 2n−1. Therefore the renaming lower bound forK< 2nis incorrect. More precisely, our main theorem states that there exists a wait-free renaming protocol forK< 2nif and only ifn+ 1 is not a prime power. We prove this result using the known equivalence ofK-renaming forK&equals; 2n− 1 and theweak symmetry breakingtask: processes have no input values and the output values are 0 or 1, and it is required that in every execution in which all processes participate, at least one process decides 1 and at least one process decides 0.
