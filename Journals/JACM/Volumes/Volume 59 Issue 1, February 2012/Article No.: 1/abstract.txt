Probabilistic ω-automata are variants of nondeterministic automata over infinite words where all choices are resolved by probabilistic distributions. Acceptance of a run for an infinite input word can be defined using traditional acceptance criteria for ω-automata, such as Büchi, Rabin or Streett conditions. The accepted language of a probabilistic ω-automata is then defined by imposing a constraint on the probability measure of the accepting runs. In this paper, we study a series of fundamental properties of probabilistic ω-automata with three different language-semantics: (1) the probable semantics that requires positive acceptance probability, (2) the almost-sure semantics that requires acceptance with probability 1, and (3) the threshold semantics that relies on an additional parameter λ &in; &rsqb;0,1&lsqb; that specifies a lower probability bound for the acceptance probability. We provide a comparison of probabilistic ω-automata under these three semantics and nondeterministic ω-automata concerning expressiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, we address closure properties under the Boolean operators union, intersection and complementation and algorithmic aspects, such as checking emptiness or language containment.
