Themaximum cardinalityandmaximum weight matchingproblems can be solved inÕ(m√n) time, a bound that has resisted improvement despite decades of research. (Heremandnare the number of edges and vertices.) In this article, we demonstrate that this “m√nbarrier” can be bypassed by approximation. For anyε> 0, we give an algorithm that computes a (1 −ε)-approximate maximum weight matching inO(mε−1logε−1) time, that is, optimallinear timefor any fixedε. Our algorithm is dramatically simpler than the best exact maximum weight matching algorithms on general graphs and should be appealing in all applications that can tolerate a negligible relative error.
