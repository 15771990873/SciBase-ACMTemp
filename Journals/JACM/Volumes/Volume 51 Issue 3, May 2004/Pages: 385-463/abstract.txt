We introduce thesmoothed analysis of algorithms, which continuously interpolates between the worst-case and average-case analyses of algorithms. In smoothed analysis, we measure the maximum over inputs of the expected performance of an algorithm under small random perturbations of that input. We measure this performance in terms of both the input size and the magnitude of the perturbations. We show that the simplex algorithm hassmoothed complexitypolynomial in the input size and the standard deviation of Gaussian perturbations.
