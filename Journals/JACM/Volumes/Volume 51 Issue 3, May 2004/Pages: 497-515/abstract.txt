We motivate and develop a natural bicriteria measure for assessing the quality of a clustering that avoids the drawbacks of existing measures. A simple recursive heuristic is shown to have poly-logarithmic worst-case guarantees under the new measure. The main result of the article is the analysis of a popularspectralalgorithm. One variant of spectral clustering turns out to have effective worst-case guarantees; another finds a "good" clustering, if one exists.
