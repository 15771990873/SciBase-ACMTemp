The differences between and appropriateness of branching versus linear time temporal logic for reasoning about concurrent programs are studied. These issues have been previously considered by Lamport. To facilitate a careful examination of these issues, a language, CTL*, in which a universal or existential path quantifier can prefix an arbitrary linear time assertion, is defined. The expressive power of a number of sublanguages is then compared. CTL* is also related to the logics MPL of Abrahamson and PL of Harel, Kozen, and Parikh. The paper concludes with a comparison of the utility of branching and linear time temporal logics.
