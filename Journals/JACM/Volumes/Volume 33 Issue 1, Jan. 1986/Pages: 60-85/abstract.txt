In this paper anO(NlogN) algorithm for routing through a rectangle is presented. Consider ann-by-mrectangular grid and a set ofNtwo-terminal nets. A net is a pair of points on the boundary of the rectangle. A layout is a set of edge-disjoint paths, one for each net. Our algorithm constructs a layout, if there is one, inO(NlogN) time; this contrasts favorably with the area of the layout that might be as large asN2. The layout constructed can be wired using four layers of interconnect with onlyO(N) contact cuts. A partial extension to multiterminal nets is also discussed.
