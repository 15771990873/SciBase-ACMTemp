An algorithm for computing bounds on the performance measures of multiple-class, product-form queuing networks is presented. The algorithm offers the user a hierarchy of bounds with differing accuracy levels and computational cost requirements. Unlike previously proposed bounding algorithms, the algorithm is applicable to all of the types of product-form queuing networks that are commonly used in computer system and computer-communication network applications.
