The single-source shortest paths problem (SSSP) is one of the classic problems in algorithmic graph theory: given a positively weighted graphGwith a source vertexs, find the shortest path fromsto all other vertices in the graph.Since 1959, all theoretical developments in SSSP for general directed and undirected graphs have been based on Dijkstra's algorithm, visiting the vertices in order of increasing distance froms. Thus, any implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm sorts the vertices according to their distances froms. However, we do not know how to sort in linear time.Here, a deterministic linear time and linear space algorithm is presented for the undirected single  source shortest paths problem with positive integer weights. The algorithm avoids the sorting bottleneck by building a hierarchical bucketing structure, identifying vertex pairs that may be visited in any order.
