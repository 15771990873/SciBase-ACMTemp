Concurrent executions of a zero-knowledge protocol by a single prover (with one or more verifiers) may leak information and may not be zero-knowledgein toto. In this article, we study the problem of maintaining zero-knowledge.We introduce the notion of an (α, β)timing constraint: for any two processorsP1andP2, ifP1measures α elapsed time on its local clock andP2measures β elapsed time on its local clock, andP2startsafterP1does, thenP2will finish afterP1does. We show that if the adversary is constrained by an (α, β) assumption then there exist four-round almost concurrent zero-knowledge interactive proofs and perfect concurrent zero-knowledge arguments for every language inNP. We also address the more specific problem ofDeniable Authentication, for which we propose several particularly efficient solutions. Deniable Authentication is of independent interest, even in the sequential case; our concurrent solutions yield sequential solutionswithout recourse to timing, that is, in the standard model.
