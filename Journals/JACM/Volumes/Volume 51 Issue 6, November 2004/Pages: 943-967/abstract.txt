The dynamic behavior of a network in which information is changing continuously over time requires robust and efficient mechanisms for keeping nodes updated about new information.Gossip protocolsare mechanisms for this task in which nodes communicate with one another according to some underlying deterministic or randomized algorithm, exchanging information in each communication step. In a variety of contexts, the use of randomization to propagate information has been found to provide better reliability and scalability than more regimented deterministic approaches.In many settings, such as a cluster of distributed computing hosts, new information is generated at individual nodes, and is most "interesting" to nodes that are nearby. Thus, we proposedistance-based propagation boundsas a performance measure for gossip mechanisms: a node at distancedfrom the origin of a new piece of information should be able to learn about this information with a delay that grows slowly withd, and isindependentof the size of the network.For nodes arranged with uniform density in Euclidean space, we present natural gossip mechanisms, calledspatial gossip, that satisfy such a guarantee: new information is spread to nodes at distanced, with high probability, inO(log1 + &epsiv;d) time steps. Such a bound combines the desirable qualitative features ofuniform gossip, in which information is spread with a delay that is logarithmic in the full network size, anddeterministic flooding, in which information is spread with a delay that is linear in the distance and independent of the network size. Our mechanisms and their analysis resolve a conjecture of Demers et al. [1987].We further show an application of our gossip mechanisms to a basicresource location problem, in which nodes seek to rapidly learn the location of the nearest copy of aresourcein a network. This problem, which is of considerable practical importance, can be solved by a very simple protocol using Spatial Gossip, whereas we can show that no protocol built on top of uniform gossip can inform nodes of their approximately nearest resource within poly-logarithmic time. The analysis relies on an additional useful property of spatial gossip, namely that information travels from its source to sinks along short paths not visiting points of the network far from the two nodes.
