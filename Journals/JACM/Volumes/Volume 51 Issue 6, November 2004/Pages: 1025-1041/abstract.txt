We consider the problem of approximating a givenm×nmatrixAby another matrix of specified rankk, which is smaller thanmandn. The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) can be used to find the "best" such approximation. However, it takes time polynomial inm, nwhich is prohibitive for some modern applications. In this article, we develop an algorithm that is qualitatively faster, provided we may sample the entries of the matrix in accordance with a natural probability distribution. In many applications, such sampling can be done efficiently. Our main result is a randomized algorithm to findthe description ofa matrixD*of rank at mostkso that holds with probability at least 1 − δ (where &verbar;·&verbar;Fis the Frobenius norm). The algorithm takes time polynomial ink,1/&epsi;, log(1/δ) only and isindependent of m and n. In particular, this implies that in constant time, it can be determined if a given matrix of arbitrary size has a good low-rank approximation.
