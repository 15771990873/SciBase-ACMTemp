A silver is a tetrahedon whose four vertices lie close to a plane and  whose orthogonal projection to that plane is a convex quadrilateral with no short edge. Silvers are notoriously common in 3-dimensional Delaunay triangulations even for well-spaced point sets. We show that, if the Delaunay triangulation has the ratio property introduced in Miller et al. [1995], then there is an assignment of weights so the weighted Delaunay traingulation contains no silvers. We also give an algorithm to compute such a weight assignment.
