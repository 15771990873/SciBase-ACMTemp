We prove tight bounds on the time needed to solvek-set agreement. In this problem, each processor starts with an arbitrary input value taken from a fixed set, and halts after choosing an output value. In every execution, at mostkdistinct output values may be chosen, and every processor's output value must be some processor's input value. We analyze this problem in a synchronous, message-passing model where processors fail by crashing. We prove a lower bound off/k+1degree of coordination required, and the number of faults tolerated, even in idealized models like the synchronous model. The proof of this result is interesting because it is the first to  apply topological techniques to the synchronous model.
