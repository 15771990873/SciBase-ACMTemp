We develop a single rounding algorithm for scheduling on unrelated parallel machines; this algorithm works well with the known linear programming-, quadratic programming-, and convex programming-relaxations for scheduling to minimize completion time, makespan, and other well-studied objective functions. This algorithm leads to the following applications for the general setting of unrelated parallel machines: (i) a bicriteria algorithm for a schedule whose weighted completion-time and makespansimultaneouslyexhibit the current-best individual approximations for these criteria; (ii) better-than-two approximation guarantees for scheduling to minimize theLpnorm of the vector of machine-loads, for all 1 <p< âˆž; and (iii) the first constant-factor multicriteria approximation algorithms that can handle the weighted completion-time andanygiven collection of integerLpnorms. Our algorithm has a natural interpretation as a melding of linear-algebraic and probabilistic approaches. Via this view, it yields a common generalization of rounding theorems due to Karp et al. [1987] and Shmoys & Tardos [1993], and leads to improved approximation algorithms for the problem of scheduling with resource-dependent processing times introduced by Grigoriev et al. [2007].
