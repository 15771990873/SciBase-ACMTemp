A sequencing problem wherein there is a single processor and a finite number of jobs needing service is considered. Each job consists of a sequence of tasks generated probabilistically by a finite state Markov chain. Each state in the Markov chain is identified with a task and has a service-time requirement and a deferral cost, both of which are random variables. The goal is to minimize the expected value of the sum of the weighted finishing times of all the tasks. The sequencing discipline is nonpreemptive. It is shown that there exists an optimal priority sequencing rule based on a rank defined for each task; an efficient algorithm for calculating the rank is given.
