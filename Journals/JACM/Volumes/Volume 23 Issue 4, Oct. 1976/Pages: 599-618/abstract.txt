A computer solution to the problem of automatic location of objects in digital pictures is presented. A self-scaling local edge detector that can be applied in parallel on a picture is described. Clustering algorithms and sequential boundary following algorithms process the edge data to local images of objects and generate a data structure that represents the imaged objects.
