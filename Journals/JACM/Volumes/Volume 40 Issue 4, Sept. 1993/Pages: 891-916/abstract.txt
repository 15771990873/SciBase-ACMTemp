We consider logic programs with a single recursive rules, whose right-hand side consists of binary relations forming a chain. We give a complete characterization of all programs of this form that are computable in NC (assuming thatPâ‰ ). Our proof uses ideas from automata and language theory, and the combinatorics of strings.
