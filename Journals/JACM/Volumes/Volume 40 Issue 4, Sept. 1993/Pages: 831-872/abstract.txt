The Concurrency Control (CC) scheme employed can profoundly affect the performance of transaction-processing systems. In this paper, a simple unified approximate analysis methodology to model the effect on system performance of data contention under different CC schemes and for different system structures is developed. This paper concentrates on modeling data contention and then, as others have done in other papers, the solutions of the data contention model are coupled with a standard hardware resource contention model through an iteration. The methodology goes beyond previously published methods for analyzing CC schemes in terms of the generality of CC schemes and system structures that are handled. The methodology is applied to analyze the performance of centralized transaction processing systems using various optimistic- and pessimistic-type CC schemes and for both fixed-length and variable-length transactions. The accuracy of the analysis is demonstrated by comparison with simulations. It is also shown how the methodology can be applied to analyze the performance of distributed transaction-processing systems with replicated data.
