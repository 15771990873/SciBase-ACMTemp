This article focuses on computations on large graphs (e.g., the web-graph) where the edges of the graph are presented as a stream. The objective in the streaming model is to use small amount of memory (preferably sub-linear in the number of nodesn) and a smaller number of passes.In the streaming model, we show how to perform several graph computations including estimating the probability distribution after a random walk of lengthl, the mixing timeM, and other related quantities such as the conductance of the graph. By applying our algorithm for computing probability distribution on the web-graph, we can estimate thePageRankpof any node up to an additive error of &sqrt;εp+ε inÕ(&sqrt;M/α) passes andÕ(min(nα+1/ε&sqrt;M/α+(1/ε)Mα, αn&sqrt;Mα + (1/ε)&sqrt;M/α)) space, for any α &in; (0,1]. Specifically, for ε &equals;M/n, α &equals;M−1/2, we can compute the approximate PageRank values in Õ(nM−1/4) space and Õ(M3/4) passes. In comparison, a standard implementation of the PageRank algorithm will takeO(n)space andO(M)passes. We also give an approach to approximate the PageRank values in just Õ(1) passes although this requires Õ(nM) space.
