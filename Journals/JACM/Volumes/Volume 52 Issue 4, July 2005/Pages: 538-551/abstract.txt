In the ASYMMETRICk-CENTER problem, the input is an integerkand a complete digraph overnpoints together with a distance function obeying the directed triangle inequality. The goal is to choose a set ofkpoints to serve as centers and to assign all the points to the centers, so that the maximum distance of any point from its center is as small as possible.We show that the ASYMMETRICk-CENTER problem is hard to approximate up to a factor of log&ast;n−O(1) unlessNP⊆DTIME(nlog logn). Since anO(log&ast;n)-approximation algorithm is known for this problem, this resolves the asymptotic approximability of ASYMMETRICk-CENTER. This is the first natural problem whose approximability threshold does not polynomially relate to the known approximation classes. We also resolve the approximability threshold of the metric (symmetric)k-Center problem with costs.
