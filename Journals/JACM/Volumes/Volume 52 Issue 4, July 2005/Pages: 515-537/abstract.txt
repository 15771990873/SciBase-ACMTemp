We present the first in-place algorithm for sorting an array of sizenthat performs, in the worst case, at mostO(nlogn) element comparisons andO(n) element transports.This solves a long-standing open problem, stated explicitly, for example, in Munro and Raman [1992], of whether there exists a sorting algorithm that matches the asymptotic lower bounds on all computational resources simultaneously.
