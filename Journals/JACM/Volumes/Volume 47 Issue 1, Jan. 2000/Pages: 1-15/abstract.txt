Thek-server problem is a generalization of the paging problems, and is the most studied problem in the area of competive online problems.  The Harmonic algorithm is a very natural and simple randomized algorithm for thek-server problem.  We give a simple proof that the Harmonick-server algorithm is competitive.  The competitive ratio we prove is the best currently known fo the algorithm.  The Harmonic algorithm is memoryless and time-efficient.  This is the only such algorithm known to be competitive for thek-server problem.
