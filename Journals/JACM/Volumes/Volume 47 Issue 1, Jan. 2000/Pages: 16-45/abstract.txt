We identify and study a natural and frequently occurring subclass of Concurrent Read, Exclusive Write Parallel Random Access Machines (CREW-PRAMs). Called Concurrent Read,OwnerWrite, or CROW-PRAMS, these are machines in which each global memory location is assigned a unique “owner” processor, which is the only processor allowed to write into it.  Considering the difficulties that would be involved in physically realizinga full CREW-PRAM model and demonstrate its stability under several definitional changes.  Second, we precisely characterize the power of the CROW-PRAM by showing that the class of languages recognizable by it in timeO(log n) (and implicity with a polynomial number of processors) is exactly the class LOGDCFL of languages  log space reducible to deterministic context-free languages.  Third, using the same basic machinery, we show that the recognition problem for deterministic context-free languages can be solved quickly on a deterministic auxilliary pushdown automation having random access to its input tape, a lognspace work tape, and pushdown store of small maximum height. For example, timeO(n1 + &egr;) is achievable with pushdown heightO(log2n). These result extend and unify work of von Braunmöhl, Cook, Mehlhorn, and Verbeek, Klein and Reif; and Rytter.
