We significantly improve known time bounds for solving the minimum cut problem on undirected graphs.  We use a "semiduality" between minimum cuts and maximum spanning tree packings combined with our previously developed random sampling techniques. We give a randomized (Monte Carlo) algorithm that finds a minimum cut in anm-edge,n-vertex graph with high probability inO(m log3n) time. We also give a simpler randomized algorithm that findsallminimum cuts with high probability in O(mlog3
