The main contribution of this work is anO(nlogn+k)-time algorithm for computing allkintersections amongnline segments in the plane. This time complexity is easily shown to be optimal. Within the same asymptotic cost, our algorithm can also construct the subdivision of the plane defined by the segments and compute which segment (if any) lies right above (or below) each intersection and each endpoint. The algorithm has been implemented and performs very well. The storage requirement is on the order ofn+kin the worst case, but it is considerably lower in practice. To analyze the complexity of the algorithm, an amortization argument based on a new combinatorial theorem on line arrangements is used.
