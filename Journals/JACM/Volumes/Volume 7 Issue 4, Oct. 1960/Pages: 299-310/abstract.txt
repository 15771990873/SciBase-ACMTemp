The literature concerned with methods for finding the minimal form of a truth function is, by now, quite extensive. This article extends this knowledge by introducing an algorithm whereby all calculations are performed on decimal numbers obtained from binary-decimal conversion of the terms of the Boolean function. Several computational aids are presented for the purpose of adapting this algorithm to the solution of large-scale problems on a digital computer.
