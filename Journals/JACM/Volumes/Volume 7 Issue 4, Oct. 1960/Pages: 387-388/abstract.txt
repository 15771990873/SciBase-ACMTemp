Numerous formulas are available for the computation of the Gamma function [1, 2]. The purpose of this note is to indicate the value of a well-known method that is easily extended for higher accuracy requirements.Using the recursion formula for the Gamma function, &Ggr;(x+ 1) =x&Ggr;(x), (1) and Stirling's asymptotic expansion for ln &Ggr;(x) [3], we have ln &Ggr;(x) ∼ (x- 1/2) lnx-x+ 1/2 ln 2&pgr; + ∑Nr=1Cr/x2r-1. (2) It follows that, ifkandNare appropriately selected positive integers, &Ggr;(x+ 1) can be represented by &Ggr;(x+ 1) ∼ √2&pgr; exp (x+k- 1/2) ln (x+k) - (x+k) exp ∑Nr=1Cr/(x+k)2r-1/(x+ 1)(x+ 2) ··· (x+k- 1) (3) whereCr= (- 1)r-1Br/(2r- 1)(2r),Brbeing the Bernoulli numbers [4]. These coefficients have been published by Uhler [5].Requiring the range 0 &lE;x&lE; 1 is no restriction since, if necessary, &Ggr;(x+ 1) can be generated for other arguments using (1).For a givenN, the error in (2) can be estimated from |&egr;| < |CN+1|/x2N+1. (4)The curves of Figure 1 show contours of constant error bound as a function ofNandx. These curves represent single and double-precision floating-arithmetic requirements of &egr; < 5·10-9and &egr; < 5·10-17. For a givenN,kis defined as the minimum integralxgreater than or equal to those on the curves. ThenNandkcan be chosen to minimize round-off and computing time.ForNandkequal to 4, formula (3) yields &Ggr;(x+ 1) ∼ &radic2;&pgr; exp (x+ 4 - 1/2) ln (x+ 4) - (x+ 4) exp ∑4r=1Cr/(x+ 4)2r-1/(x+ 1)(x+ 2)(x+ 3). (5)A similar expression suitable for double precision results forN= 8 andk= 9.The exponents in (5) are split to reduce roundoff. Various algebraic manipulations might result in a further reduction of roundoff.
