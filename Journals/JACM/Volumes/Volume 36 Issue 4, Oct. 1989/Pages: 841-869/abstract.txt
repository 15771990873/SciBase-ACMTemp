Theoretical results are presented on multi-pass (both left-to-right and alternating), multi-sweep, and multi-visit attribute grammars. For each of these, a pure type and a simple type are distinguished: The pure attribute grammars are defined by nondeterministic attribute evaluators, and the simple ones by the corresponding (usual) deterministic evaluators. The time complexity of deciding membership in these classes of attribute grammars is studied. In general, this is harder for the pure classes than for the simple ones, for which it is either polynomial or NP-complete. The expressive power of the eight classes is compared by studying the translations they can compute. It is shown that sweeps are more powerful than passes, and visits are more powerful than sweeps.
