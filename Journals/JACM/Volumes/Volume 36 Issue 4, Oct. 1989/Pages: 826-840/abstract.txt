The design of systolic algorithms is discussed, that is, algorithms that may efficiently be executed by a synchronous array of cells that perform local communications only. Systolic algorithms are designed through techniques developed in the context of sequential programming. Heuristics are given that guide the programmer in the design of a variety of efficient solutions.
