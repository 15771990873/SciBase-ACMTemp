It is shown that for a given problem different machine organizations will vary in time of solution over a nine-fold range. This holds even if it is assumed that the machines used the same arithmetic section and the same memory. The comparison is made on the basis of a typical problemâ€”in this case the Kaczmarz iteration. An efficiency number is developed giving the relative solution time required by each organization. When the efficiency number of a single address machine is taken to be 1.0, the following numbers are obtained: four address machine, 1.25; single address machine with index registers, 2.5; complex organization, 9.
