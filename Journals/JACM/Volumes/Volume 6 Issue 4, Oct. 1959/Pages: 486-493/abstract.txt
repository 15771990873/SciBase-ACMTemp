In this paper we wish to initiate the study of the application of dynamic programming to the domain of problems arising in the synthesis of logical systems.In a number of fields one encounters the problem of converting a system in one state into another state in a most efficient fashionâ€”in mathematical economics, in the theory of control processes, in network theory, and in trajectory processes. Here we wish to consider a type of question which arises in the design of computers and switching circuits.We shall first treat the problem in general terms, and then consider a special example to illustrate the methods.
