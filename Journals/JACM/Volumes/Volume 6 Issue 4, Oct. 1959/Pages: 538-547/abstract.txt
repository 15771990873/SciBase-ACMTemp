The primary objective of this paper is to extend the results of the earlier paper, “A Functional Canonical Form”, in this journal [4]. This extension includes the application of the fundamental functional canonical form to multiple output circuits and the formulation of cost bounds on these circuits. It also includes the use of a multifunctional canonical form in the design of single output circuits.
