We give a data structure that allows arbitrary insertions and deletions on a planar point setPand supports basic queries on the convex hull ofP, such as membership and tangent-finding. Updates takeO(log1+&egr;n) amori tzed time and queries takeO(logntime each, wherenis the maximum size ofPand &egr; is any fixed positive constant. For some advanced queries such as bridge-finding, both our bounds increase toO(log3/2n). The only previous fully dynamic solution was by Overmars and van Leeuwen from 1981 and requiredO(log2n) time per update andO(logn) time per query.
