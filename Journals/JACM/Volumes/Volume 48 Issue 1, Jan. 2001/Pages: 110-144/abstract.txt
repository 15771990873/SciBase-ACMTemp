In the context of mesh-like, parallel processing computers for (i) approximating continuous space and (ii)analogsimulation of the motion of objects and waves in continuous space, the present paper is concerned withwhichmesh-like interconnection of processors might be particularly suitable for the task and why.Processor interconnection schemes based on nearest neighbor connections in geometric lattices are presented along with motivation. Then two major threads are exploded regarding which lattices would be good: theregular lattices, for their symmetry and other properties in common with continuous space, and the well-knownroot lattices, for being, in a sense, the lattices required for physically   natural basic algorithms for motion.The main theorem of the present paper implies thatthewell-known lattice Anis the regular lattice having the maximum number of nearest neighbors among then-dimensional regular lattices. It is noted that the onlyn-dimensional lattices that are both regular and root are Anand Zn(Znis the lattice ofn-cubes. The remainder of the paper specifies other desirable properties of An
