The generalized feedback shift register pseudorandom number algorithm has several advantages over all other pseudorandom number generators. These advantages are: (1) it produces multidimensional pseudorandom numbers; (2) it has an arbitrarily long period independent of the word size of the computer on which it is implemented; (3) it is faster than other pseudorandom number generators; (4) the “same” floating-point pseudorandom number sequence is obtained on any machine, that is, the high order mantissa bits of each pseudorandom number agree on all machines— examples are given for IBM 360, Sperry-Rand-Univac 1108, Control Data 6000, and Hewlett-Packard 2100 series computers; (5) it can be coded in compiler languages (it is portable); (6) the algorithm is easily implemented in microcode and has been programmed for an Interdata computer.
