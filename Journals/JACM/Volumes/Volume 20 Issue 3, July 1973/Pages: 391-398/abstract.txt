A bound on the relative error in floating-point addition using a single-precision accumulator with guard digits is derived. It is shown that even with a single guard digit, the accuracy can be almost as good as that using a double-precision accumulator. A statistical model for the roundoff error in double-precision multiplication and addition is also derived. The model is confirmed by experimental measurements.
