This paper deals with a single-server station (a computer) where each customer's demand comprises an independent random number of jobs (programs). Under certain assumptions, two cyclic disciplines are mathematically analyzed: (a) continuous job service—a round-robin discipline where the quantum's length is distributed as the service requirement of a job; (b) intermittent job service—a double round-robin discipline—in the first instance in terms of the jobs within the customer's demand, and in the second in terms of the customer himself.
