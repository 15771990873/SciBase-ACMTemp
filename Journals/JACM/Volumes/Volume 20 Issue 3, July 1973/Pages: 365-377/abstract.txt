A reasonably efficient procedure for testing pairs of directed graphs for isomorphism is important in information retrieval and other application fields in which structured data have to be matched. One such procedure, a backtrack procedure based on a representation of directed graphs by linear formulas, is described. A procedure for finding a partial subdigraph of a digraph that is isomorphic to a given digraph is also described.
