We introduce exponential search trees as a novel technique for converting static polynomial space search structures for ordered sets into fully-dynamic linear space data structures.This leads to anoptimalbound ofO(&sqrt;logn/log logn) for searching and updating a dynamic setXofninteger keys in linear space. SearchingXfor an integerymeans finding the maximum key inXwhich is smaller than or equal toy. This problem is equivalent to the standard text book problem of maintaining an ordered set.The best previous deterministic linear space bound wasO(logn/log logn) due to Fredman and Willard from STOC 1990. No better deterministic search bound was known using polynomial space.We also get the following worst-case linear space trade-offs between the numbern, the word lengthW, and the maximal keyU< 2W:O(min log logn&plus; logn/logW, log lognâ‹… log logU/log log logU). These trade-offs are, however, not likely to be optimal.Our results are generalized to finger searching and string searching, providing optimal results for both in terms ofn.
