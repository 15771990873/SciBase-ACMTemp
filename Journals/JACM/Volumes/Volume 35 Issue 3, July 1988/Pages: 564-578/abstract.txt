A probability distribution&mgr;on [0, 1] allows perfect packing ifnitems of sizeX1, â€¦ ,Xn, independent and identically distributed according to&mgr;can be packed in unit size bins in such a way that the expected wasted space iso(n). A large class of distributions that allow perfect packing is exhibited. As a corollary, the intervals [a, b] for which the uniform distribution on [a, b] allows perfect packing are determined.
