LetGandHbe two mesh-connected arrays of processors, whereG=g1, Xg2X … Xg1,H=h1xh2x … xhd, andg1…g1≤h1…hd. The problem of simulatingGbyHis considered and the best possible simulation in terms of thegi's andhi's is characterized by giving such a simulation and proving its optimality in the worst-case sense. Also the same bound on the average cost of encoding the edges ofGas distinct paths inHis established.
