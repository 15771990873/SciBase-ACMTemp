Modular integer exponentiation (givena, e,andm, computeaemodm) is a fundamental problem in algebraic complexity for which no efficient parallel algorithm is known. Two closely related problems are modular polynomial exponentiation (givena(x),e, andm(x), compute (a(x))emodm(x)) and polynomial exponentiation (givena(x),e. andt, compute the coefficient ofxtin (a(x))e). It is shown that these latter two problems are inNC2whena(x) andm(x) are polynomials over a finite field whose characteristic is polynomial in the input size.
