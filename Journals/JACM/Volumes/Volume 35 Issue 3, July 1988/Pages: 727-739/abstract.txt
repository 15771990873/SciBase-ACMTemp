Recent advances in graph theory and graph algorithms dramatically alter the traditional view of concrete complexity theory, in which a decision problem is generally shown to be in P by producing an efficient algorithm to solve an optimization version of the problem. Nonconstructive tools are now available for classifying problems as decidable in polynomial time by guaranteeing only theexistenceof polynomial-timedecisionalgorithms. In this paper these new methods are employed to prove membership in P for a number of problems whose complexities are not otherwise known. Powerful consequences of these techniques are pointed out and their utility is illustrated. A type of partially ordered set that supports this general approach is defined and explored.
