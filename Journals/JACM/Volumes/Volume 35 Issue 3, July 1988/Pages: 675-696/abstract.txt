A new algorithm for the hierarchical aggregation of singularly perturbed finite-state Markov processes is derived. The approach taken bridges the gap between conceptually simple results for a relatively restricted class of processes and the significantly more complex results for the general case. The critical role played by (almost) transient states is exposed, resulting in a straightforward algorithm for the construction of a sequence of aggregate generators associated with various time scales. These generators together provide a uniform asymptotic approximation of the original probability transition function.
