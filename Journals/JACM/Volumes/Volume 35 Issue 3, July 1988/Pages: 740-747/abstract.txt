LetMbe a parallel RAM withpprocessors and arithmetic operations addition and subtraction recognizingL âŠ‚ NninTsteps. (Inputs forMare given integer by integer, not bit by bit.) ThenLcan be recognized by a (sequential) linear search algorithm (LSA) inO(n4(log(n) +T+ log(p))) steps. Thus manyn-dimensional restrictions of NP-complete problems (binary programming, traveling salesman problem, etc.) and even that of the uniquely optimum traveling salesman problem, which is &Dgr;P2-complete, can be solved in polynomial time by an LSA. This result generalizes the construction of a polynomial LSA for then-dimensional restriction of the knapsack problem previously shown by the author, and destroys the hope of proving nonpolynomial lower bounds on LSAs for any problem that can be recognized by a PRAM as above with 2poly(n)processors in poly(n) time.
