The problem of generating random, uniformly distributed, binary
trees is considered. A closed formula that counts the number of trees
having a left subtee withk-1nodesk=1,2,...,nis found. By inverting the formula, random trees withnnodes are generated according to the appropriate
probability distribution, determining the number of nodes in the left
and right subtrees that can be generated recursively. The procedure is
shown to run in timeOn, occupying an extra space in the order ofOn.
