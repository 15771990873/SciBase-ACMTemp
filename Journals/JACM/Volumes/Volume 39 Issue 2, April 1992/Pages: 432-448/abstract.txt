Given a regular expressionRof lengthPand a wordAof lengthN, the membership problem is to determine ifAis in the language denoted byR. AnO(PN/lgN) time algorithm is presented that is based on a lgNspeedup of the standardO(PN) time simulation ofR's nonderministic finite automaton onAusing a combination of the node-listing and “Four-Russians” paradigms. This result places a new worst-case upper bound on regular expression pattern matching. Moreover, in practice the method provides an implementation that is faster than existing software for small regular expressions.
