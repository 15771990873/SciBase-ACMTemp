The problem of obtaining the skeleton of a digitized figure is reduced to an optimal policy problem. A hierarchy of methods of defining the skeleton is proposed; in the more complicated ones, the skeleton is relatively invariant under rotation. Two algorithms for computing the skeleton are defined, and the corresponding computer programs are compared. A criterion is proposed for determining the most significant skeleton points.
