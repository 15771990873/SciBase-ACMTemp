Moving regions are a form of spatiotemporal data in which a region changes in shape and/or position over time. In many fields, moving regions representing real-world phenomena are collected using sensors that take temporally encoded snapshots of regions. We provide a novel algorithm that creates a moving region between any two complex regions. The proposed algorithm has worst-case time bounds ofO;(n;2), but can use approximation techniques to achieveO(nlgn) in practice, space bounds ofO;(n;), and output size bounded byO;(n;) (wheren;is the number of line segments that define the boundaries of the regions).
