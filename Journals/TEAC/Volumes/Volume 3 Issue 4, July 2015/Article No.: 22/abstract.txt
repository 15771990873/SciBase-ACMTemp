We study lower bounds on the query complexity of determining correlated equilibrium. In particular, we consider a query model in which ann-player game is specified via a black box that returns players' utilities at pure action profiles. In this model, we establish that in order to compute a correlated equilibrium, anydeterministicalgorithm must query the black box an exponential (inn) number of times.
