We consider the problem of designing mechanisms that interact with strategic agents throughstrategicintermediaries (or mediators), and investigate the cost to society due to the mediatorsâ€™ strategic behavior. Selfish agents with private information are each associated with exactly one strategic mediator, and can interact with the mechanism exclusively through that mediator. Each mediator aims to optimize the combined utility ofhisagents, while the mechanism aims to optimize the combined utility ofallagents. We focus on the problem of facility location on a metric induced by a publicly known tree. With nonstrategic mediators, there is a dominant strategy mechanism that is optimal. We show that when both agents and mediators act strategically, there is no dominant strategy mechanism that achievesanyapproximation. We, thus, slightly relax the incentive constraints, and define the notion of atwo-sided incentive compatiblemechanism. We show that the 3-competitivedeterministicmechanism suggested by Procaccia and Tennenholtz [2013] and Dekel et al. [2010] for lines extends naturally to trees, and is still 3-competitive as well as two-sided incentive compatible. This is essentially the best possible (follows from Dekel et al. [2010] and Procaccia and Tennenholtz [2013]). We then show that by allowing randomization one can construct a 2-competitiverandomizedmechanism that is two-sided incentive compatible, and this is also essentially tight. This result also reduces a gap left in the work of Procaccia and Tennenholtz [2013] and Lu et al. [2009] for the problem of designing strategy-proof mechanisms for weighted agents with no mediators on a line. We also investigate a generalization of the preceding setting where there are multiple levels of mediators.
