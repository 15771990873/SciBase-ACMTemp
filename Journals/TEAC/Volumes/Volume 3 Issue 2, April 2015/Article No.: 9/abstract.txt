We study truthful auctions for secondary spectrum usage in wireless networks. In this scenario,ncommunication requests need to be allocated tokavailable channels that are subject to interference and noise. We present the first truthful mechanisms for secondary spectrum auctions with symmetric or submodular valuations. Our approach to model interference uses an edge-weighted conflict graph, and our algorithms provide asymptotically almost optimal approximation bounds for conflict graphs with a small inductive independence numberρ<<n. This approach covers a large variety of interference models such as, for instance, the protocol model or the recently popular physical model of interference. For unweighted conflict graphs and symmetric valuations we use LP-rounding to obtainO(ρ)-approximate mechanisms; for weighted conflict graphs we get a factor ofO(ρ· (logn+ logk)). For submodular users we combine the convex rounding framework of Dughmi et al. [2011] with randomized metarounding to obtainO(ρ)-approximate mechanisms for matroid-rank-sum valuations; for weighted conflict graphs we can fully drop the dependence onkto getO(ρ· logn). We conclude with promising initial results for deterministically truthful mechanisms that allow approximation factors based onρ.
