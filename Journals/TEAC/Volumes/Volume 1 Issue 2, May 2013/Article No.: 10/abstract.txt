We study online profit-maximizing auctions for digital goods with adversarial bid selection and uniformly random arrivals; in this sense, our model lies at the intersection of prior-free mechanism design and secretary problems. Our goal is to design auctions that are constant competitive withF(2). We give a generic reduction that transforms any offline auction to an online one with only a loss of a factor of 2 in the competitive ratio. We also present some natural auctions, both randomized and deterministic, and study their competitive ratio. Our analysis reveals some interesting connections of one of these auctions with RSOP.
