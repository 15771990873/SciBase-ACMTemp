Caches contribute to much of a microprocessor system's power and energy consumption. Numerous new cache architectures, such as phased, pseudo-set-associative, way predicting, reactive-associative, way-shutdown, way-concatenating, and highly-associative, are intended to reduce power and/or energy, but they all impose some performance overhead. We have developed a new cache architecture, called a way-halting cache, that reduces energy further than previously mentioned architectures, while imposing no performance overhead. Our way-halting cache is a four-way set-associative cache that stores the four lowest-order bits of all ways' tags into a fully associative memory, which we call the halt tag array. The lookup in the halt tag array is done in parallel with, and is no slower than, the set-index decoding. The halt tag array predetermines which tags cannot match due to their low-order 4 bits mismatching. Further accesses to ways with known mismatching tags are then halted, thus saving power. Our halt tag array has an additional feature of using static logic only, rather than dynamic logic used in highly associative caches, making our cache simpler to design with existing tools. We provide data from experiments on 29 benchmarks drawn from Powerstone, Mediabench, and Spec 2000, based on our layouts in 0.18 micron CMOS technology. On average, we obtained 55&percnt; savings of memory-access related energy over a conventional four-way set-associative cache. We show that savings are greater than previous methods, and nearly twice that of highly associative caches, while imposing no performance overhead and only 2&percnt; cache area overhead.
