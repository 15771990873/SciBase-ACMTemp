A systematic methodology for near-optimal software/hardware codesign mapping onto an FPGA platform with microprocessor and HW accelerators is proposed. The mapping steps deal with the inter-organization, the foreground memory management, and the datapath mapping. A step is described by parameters and equations combined in a scalable template. Mapping decisions are propagated as design constraints to prune suboptimal options in next steps. Several performance-area Pareto points are produced by instantiating the parameters. To evaluate our methodology we map a real-time bio-imaging application and loop-dominated benchmarks.
