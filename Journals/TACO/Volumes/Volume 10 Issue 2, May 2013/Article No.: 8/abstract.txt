Coarse-grained reconfigurable architecture typically has an array of processing elements which are controlled by a centralized unit. This makes it difficult to execute programs having control divergence among PEs without predication. However, conventional predication techniques have a negative impact on both performance and power consumption due to longer instruction words and unnecessary instruction-fetching decoding nullifying steps. This article reveals performance and power issues in predicated execution which have not been well-addressed yet. Furthermore, it proposes fast and power-efficient predication mechanisms. Experiments conducted through gate-level simulation show that our mechanism improves energy-delay product by 11.9&percnt; to 23.8&percnt; on average.
