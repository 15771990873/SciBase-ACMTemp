Transactional Memory (TM) is no longer just an academic interest as industry has started to adopt the idea in its commercial products. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Transaction Issue (DTI), a new scheme that can be easily implemented on top of existing Hardware TM (HTM) systems, provided additional messages. Instead of wasting power and energy in transaction aborts, Dynamic Transaction Issue puts a processor core into a low-power state when there is a reasonable suspicion that the current transaction running on it will be aborted soon in the future.We have implemented Dynamic Transaction Issue on a cycle-accurate simulator of a multicore processor system with out-of-order superscalar cores, augmented with a power package and a TM package which add accurate dynamic power estimates and a TM framework to the simulator. Our simulation results show that Dynamic Transaction Issue can achieve energy savings up to 37&percnt; from the energy consumption of a base machine with no mechanism to suppress useless aborts. We also compare Dynamic Transaction Issue with various alternative hardware TM mechanisms.
