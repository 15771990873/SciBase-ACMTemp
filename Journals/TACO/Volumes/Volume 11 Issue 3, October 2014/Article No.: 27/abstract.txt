Ideally, the pay-as-you-go model of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) clouds should enable users to rent just enough resources (e.g., CPU or memory bandwidth) to fulfill their service level objectives (SLOs). Achieving this goal is hard on current IaaS offers, which require users to explicitly specify the amount of resources to reserve; this requirement is nontrivial for users, because estimating the amount of resources needed to attain application-level SLOs is often complex, especially when resources are virtualized and the service provider colocates virtual machines (VMs) on host nodes. For this reason, users who deploy VMs subject to SLOs are usually prone to overprovisioning resources, thus resulting in inflated business costs.This article tackles this issue withAutoPro: a runtime system that enhances IaaS clouds with automated and fine-grained resource provisioning based on performance SLOs. Our main contribution withAutoProis filling the gap between application-level performance SLOs and allocation of a contended resource, without requiring explicit reservations from users. In this article, we focus on CPU bandwidth allocation to throughput-driven, compute-intensive multithreaded applications colocated on a multicore processor; we show that a theoretically sound, yet simple, control strategy can enable automated fine-grained allocation of this contended resource, without the need for offline profiling. Additionally,AutoProhelps service providers optimize infrastructure utilization by provisioning idle resources to best-effort workloads, so as to maximize node-level utilization.Our extensive experimental evaluation confirms thatAutoProis able to automatically determine and enforce allocations to meet performance SLOs while maximizing node-level utilization by supporting batch workloads on a best-effort basis.
