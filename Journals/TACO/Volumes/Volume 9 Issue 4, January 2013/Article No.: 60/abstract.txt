Alternative interconnects are attractive for scaling on-chip communication bandwidth in a power-efficient manner. However, efficient utilization of the bandwidth provided by these emerging interconnects still remains an open problem due to the spatial and temporal communication heterogeneity. In this article, aStream Arbitrationscheme is proposed, where at runtime any source can compete for any communication channel of the interconnect to talk to any destination. We apply stream arbitration to radio frequency interconnect (RF-I). Experimental results show that compared to the representative token arbitration scheme, stream arbitration can provide an average 20&percnt; performance improvement and 12&percnt; power reduction.
