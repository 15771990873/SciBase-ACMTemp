Dynamic Power Management (DPM) and Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) are popular techniques for reducing energy consumption. Algorithms for optimal DVFS exist, but optimal DPM and the optimal combination of DVFS and DPM are not yet solved.In this article we use well-established models of DPM and DVFS for frame-based systems. We show that it is not sufficient—as some authors argue—to consider only individual invocations of a task. We define a schedule that also takes interactions between invocations into account and prove—in a theoretical fashion—that this schedule is optimal.
