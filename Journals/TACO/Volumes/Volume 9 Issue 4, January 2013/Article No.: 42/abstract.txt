Our experimental study and analysis reveal that the bottlenecks of existing hardware transactional memory systems are largely rooted in the extra data movements in version management and in the inefficient scheduling of conflicting transactions in conflict management, particularly in the presence of high-contention and coarse-grained applications. In order to address this problem, we propose an integrated Pseudo-Associativity and Relaxed-Order approach to hardware Transactional Memory, called PARO-TM. It exploits the extra pseudo-associative space in the data cache to hold the new value of each transactional modification, and maintains the mappings between the old and new versions via an implicit pseudo-associative hash algorithm (i.e., by inverting the specific bit of the SET index). PARO-TM can branch out the speculative version from the old version upon each transactional modification on demand without a dedicated hardware component to hold the uncommitted data. This means that it is able to automatically access the proper version upon the transaction's commit or abort. Moreover, PARO-TM augments multi-version support in a chained directory to schedule conflicting transactions in a relaxed-order manner to further reduce their overheads. We compare PARO-TM with the state-of-the-art LogTM-SE, TCC, DynTM, and SUV-TM systems and find that PARO-TM consistently outperforms these four representative HTMs. This performance advantage of PARO-TM is far more pronounced under the high-contention and coarse-grained applications in the STAMP benchmark suite, for which PARO-TM is motivated and designed.
