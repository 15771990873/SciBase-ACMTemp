This paper describes thepolymorphousTRIPS architecture that can be configured for different granularities and types of parallelism. The TRIPS architecture is the first in a class of post-RISC, dataflow-like instruction sets called explicit data-graph execution (EDGE). This EDGE ISA is coupled with hardware mechanisms that enable the processing cores and the on-chip memory system to be configured and combined in different modes for instruction, data, or thread-level parallelism. To adapt to small and large-grain concurrency, the TRIPS architecture prototype contains two out-of-order, 16-wide-issue grid processor cores, which can be partitioned when easily extractable fine-grained parallelism exists. This approach to polymorphism provides better performance across a wide range of application types than an approach in which many small processors are aggregated to run workloads with irregular parallelism. Our results show that high performance can be obtained in each of the three modes---ILP, TLP, and DLP---demonstrating the viability of the polymorphous coarse-grained approach for future microprocessors.
