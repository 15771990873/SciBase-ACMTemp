With the advent of chip multiprocessors, new techniques have been developed to make parallel programing easier and more reliable. New parallel programing paradigms and new methods of making the execution of programs more efficient and more reliable have been developed. Usually, these improvements require hardware support to avoid a system slowdown.Signatures based on Bloom filters are widely used as hardware support for parallel programing in chip multiprocessors. Signatures are used in Transactional Memory, thread-level speculation, parallel debugging, deterministic replay and other tools and applications. The main limitation of hardware signatures is the lack of flexibility: if signatures are designed with a given configuration, tailored to the requirements of a specific tool or application, it is likely that they do not fit well for other different requirements.In this paper a new hardware signature organization, calledFlexible Signatures(FlexSig), is proposed.FlexSigcan change dynamically the resources assigned to a given signature and the number of signatures in the system, by redistributing the available hardware resources according to the system requirements. This allows higher flexibility than with traditional fixed-resources signatures based on Bloom filters, while maintaining a low false positive rate.FlexSighas been evaluated by comparing it with signatures based on parallel Bloom filters, and we conclude thatFlexSigoutperforms (in terms of false positive rate) conventional parallel Bloom filters in most cases, due to its ability to use all the signature resources available.
