Smartphones and tablets are becoming more and more powerful, replacing desktops and laptops as the users' main computing system. As these systems support higher and higher resolutions with more complex 3D graphics, a high-throughput and low-power memory system is essential for the mobile GPU. In this article, we propose to improve throughput/watt in a mobile GPU memory system by using intelligent scheduling to reduce power and multi-band radio frequency interconnect (MRF-I) to offset any throughput degradation caused by our intelligent scheduling. Overall, we are able to improve throughput 17&percnt; up to 66&percnt; while increasing throughput per watt by an average of 18&percnt; up to 26&percnt;.
