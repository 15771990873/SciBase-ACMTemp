Phase-Change Memory (PCM) has emerged as a promising low-power main memory candidate to replace DRAM. The main problems of PCM are that writes are much slower and more power hungry than reads, write bandwidth is much lower than read bandwidth, and limited write endurance. Adding an extra layer of cache, which is logically thelast-level cache(LLC), can mitigate the drawbacks of PCM. However, writebacks from the LLC might (a) overwhelm the limited PCM write bandwidth and stall the application, (b) shorten lifetime, and (c) increase energy consumption. Cache partitioning and replacement schemes are important to achieve high throughput for multi-core systems. However, we noted that no existing partitioning and replacement policy takes into account the writeback information.This paper proposes two writeback-aware schemes to manage the LLC for PCM main memory systems.Writeback-aware Cache Partitioning(WCP) is a runtime mechanism that partitions a shared LLC among multiple applications. Unlike past partitioning schemes, our scheme considers the reduction in cache misses as well as writebacks.Write Queue Balancing(WQB) replacement policy manages the cache partition of each application intelligently so that the writebacks are distributed evenly among PCM write queues. In this way, applications rarely stall due to unbalanced PCM write traffic among write queues. Our evaluation shows that WCP and WQB result in, on average, 21&percnt; improvement in throughput, 49&percnt; reduction in PCM writes, and 14&percnt; reduction in energy over a state-of-the-art cache partitioning scheme.
