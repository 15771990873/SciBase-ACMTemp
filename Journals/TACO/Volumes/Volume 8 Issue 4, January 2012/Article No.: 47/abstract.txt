As the energy consumption of multi-core systems becomes increasingly prominent, it's a challenge to design an energy-efficient real-time scheduling algorithm in multi-core systems for reducing the system energy consumption while guaranteeing the feasibility of real-time tasks. In this paper, we focus on multi-core processors, with the global Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling (DVFS) and Dynamic Power Management (DPM) technologies. In this setting, we propose an energy-efficient real-time scheduling algorithm, the Time Local remaining execution plane based Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling (TL-DVFS). TL-DVFS utilizes the concept of Time Local remaining execution (TL) plane to dynamically scale the voltage and frequency of a processor at the initial time of each TL plane as well as at the release time of a sporadic task in each TL plane. Consequently, TL-DVFS can obtain a reasonable tradeoff between the real-time constraint and the energy-saving while realizing the optimal feasibility of sporadic tasks. Mathematical analysis and extensive simulations demonstrate that TL-DVFS always saves more energy than existing algorithms, especially in the case of high workloads, and guarantees the optimal feasibility of sporadic tasks at the same time.
