Application performance on high-performance shared-memory systems is often limited by sharing patterns resulting in cache-coherence bottlenecks. Current approaches to identify coherence bottlenecks incur considerable run-time overhead and do not scale. We present two novel hardware-assisted coherence-analysis techniques that reduce trace sizes by two orders of magnitude over full traces. First, hardware performance monitoring is combined with capturing stores in software to provide a lossy-trace mechanism, which is an order of magnitude faster than software-instrumentation-based full-tracing and retains accuracy. Second, selected long-latency loads are instrumented via binary rewriting, which provides even higher accuracy and control over tracing, but requires additional overhead.
