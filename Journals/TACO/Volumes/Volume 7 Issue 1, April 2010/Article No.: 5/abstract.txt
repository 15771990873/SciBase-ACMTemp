High on-chip temperature impairs the processor's reliability and reduces its lifetime. Hardware-level dynamic thermal management (DTM) techniques can effectively constrain the chip temperature, but degrades the performance. We propose an OS-level technique that performs thermal-aware job scheduling to reduce DTMs. The algorithm is based on the observation that hot and cool jobs executed in a different order can make a difference in resulting temperature. Real-system implementation in Linux shows that our scheduler can remove 10.5&percnt; to 73.6&percnt; of the hardware DTMs in a medium thermal environment. The CPU throughput is improved by up to 7.6&percnt; (4.1&percnt;, on average) in a severe thermal environment.
