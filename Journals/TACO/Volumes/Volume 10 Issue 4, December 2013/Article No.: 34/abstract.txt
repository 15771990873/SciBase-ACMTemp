Accurately determining the energy consumed by each task in a system will become of prominent importance in future multicore-based systems because it offers several benefits, including (i) better application energy/performance optimizations, (ii) improved energy-aware task scheduling, and (iii) energy-aware billing in data centers. Unfortunately, existing methods for energy metering in multicores fail to provide accurate energy estimates for each task when several tasks run simultaneously.This article makes a case for accurate Per-Task Energy Metering (PTEM) based on tracking the resource utilization and occupancy of each task. Different hardware implementations with different trade-offs between energy prediction accuracy and hardware-implementation complexity are proposed. Our evaluation shows that the energy consumed in a multicore by each task can be accurately measured. For a 32-core, 2-way, simultaneous multithreaded core setup, PTEM reduces the average accuracy error from more than 12&percnt; when our hardware support is not used to less than 4&percnt; when it is used. The maximum observed error for any task in the workload we used reduces from 58&percnt; down to 9&percnt; when our hardware support is used.
