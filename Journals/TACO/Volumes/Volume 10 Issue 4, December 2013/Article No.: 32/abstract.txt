This study presents and evaluates E3CC (Enhanced Embedded ECC), a full design and implementation of a generic embedded ECC scheme that enables power-efficient error protection for subranked memory systems. It incorporates a novel address mapping scheme called Biased Chinese Remainder Mapping (BCRM) to resolve the address mapping issue for memories of page interleaving, plus a simple and effective cache design to reduce extra ECC traffic. Our evaluation using SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks confirms the performance and power efficiency of the E3CC scheme for subranked memories as well as conventional memories.
