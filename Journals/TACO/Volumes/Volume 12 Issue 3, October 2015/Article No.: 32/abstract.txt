Temporal SIMT (TSIMT) has been suggested as an alternative to conventional (spatial) SIMT for improving GPU performance on branch-intensive code. Although TSIMT has been briefly mentioned before, it was not evaluated. We present a complete design and evaluation of TSIMT GPUs, along with the inclusion of scalarization and a combination of temporal and spatial SIMT, named Spatiotemporal SIMT (STSIMT). Simulations show that TSIMT alone results in a performance reduction, but a combination of scalarization and STSIMT yields a mean performance enhancement of 19.6&percnt; and improves the energy-delay product by 26.2&percnt; compared to SIMT.
