Memory management searches for the resources required to store the concurrently alive elements. The solution quality is affected by the representation of the element accesses: a sub-optimal representation leads to overestimation and a non-scalable representation increases the exploration time. We propose a methodology to near-optimal and scalable represent regular and irregular accesses. The representation consists of a set of pattern entries to compactly describe the behavior of the memory accesses and of pattern operations to consistently combine the pattern entries. The result is a final sequence of pattern entries which represents the global access scheme without unnecessary overestimation.
