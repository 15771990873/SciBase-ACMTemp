We propose a reduced-port Register File (RF) architecture for reducing RF energy in a VLIW processor. With port reduction, RF ports need to be shared among Function Units (FUs), which may lead to access conflicts, and thus, reduced performance. Our solution includes (i) a carefully designed RF-FU interconnection network that permits port sharing with minimum conflicts and without any delay/energy overheads, and (ii) a novel scheduling and binding algorithm that reduces the performance penalty. With our solution, we observed as much as 83&percnt; RF energy savings with no more than a 10&percnt; loss in performance for a set of Mediabench and Mibench benchmarks.
