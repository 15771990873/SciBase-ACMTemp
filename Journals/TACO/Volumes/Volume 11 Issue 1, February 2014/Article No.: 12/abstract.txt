We propose a software pipelining technique adapted to specific hard real-time scheduling problems. Our technique optimizes both computation throughput and execution cycle makespan, with makespan being prioritary. It also takes advantage of the predicated execution mechanisms of our embedded execution platform. To do so, it uses a reservation table formalism allowing the manipulation of the execution conditions of operations. Our reservation tables allow the double reservation of a resource at the same dates by two different operations, if the operations have exclusive execution conditions. Our analyses can determine when double reservation is possible even for operations belonging to different iterations.
