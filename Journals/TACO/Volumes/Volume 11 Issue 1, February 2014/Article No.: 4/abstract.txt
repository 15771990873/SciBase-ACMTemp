Nonvolatile memories (NVMs) have the potential to replace low-level SRAM or eDRAM on-chip caches because NVMs save standby power and provide large cache capacity. However, limited write endurance is a common problem for NVM technologies, and today's cache management might result in unbalanced cache write traffic, causing heavily written cache blocks to fail much earlier than others. Although wear-leveling techniques for NVM-based main memories exist, we cannot simply apply them to NVM-based caches. This is because cache writes have intraset variations as well as interset variations, while writes to main memories only have interset variations.To solve this problem, we propose i2WAP, a new cache management policy that can reduce both inter- and intraset write variations. i2WAP has two features: Swap-Shift, an enhancement based on existing main memory wear leveling to reduce cache interset write variations, and Probabilistic Set Line Flush, a novel technique to reduce cache intraset write variations. Implementing i2WAP only needs two global counters and two global registers. In one of our studies, i2WAP can improve the NVM cache lifetime by 75&percnt; on average and up to 224&percnt;. We also validate that i2WAP is effective in systems with different cache configurations and workloads.
