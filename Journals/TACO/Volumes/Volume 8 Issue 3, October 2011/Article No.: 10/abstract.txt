This article proposes techniques to predict the performance impact of pending cache hits, hardware prefetching, and miss status holding register resources on superscalar microprocessors using hybrid analytical models. The proposed models focus on timeliness of pending hits and prefetches and account for a limited number of MSHRs. They improve modeling accuracy of pending hits by 3.9Ã— and when modeling data prefetching, a limited number of MSHRs, or both, these techniques result in average errors of 9.5&percnt; to 17.8&percnt;. The impact of non-uniform DRAM memory latency is shown to be approximated well by using a moving average of memory access latency.
