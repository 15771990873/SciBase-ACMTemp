Five percent to 25&percnt; of power could be wasted before it is delivered to the computational resources on a die, due to inefficiencies of voltage regulators and resistive loss. The power delivery could benefit if, at the same power, the delivered voltage increases and the current decreases. This article presentsCoreUnfolding, a technique that leverages voltage Stacking to improve power delivery efficiency. Our experiments show that about 10&percnt; system-wide power can be saved, the voltage regulator area can be reduced by 30&percnt;,di/dtimproves 49&percnt;, and the power pin count is reduced by 40&percnt; (&ap; 20&percnt; reduction in packaging costs), with negligible performance degradation.
