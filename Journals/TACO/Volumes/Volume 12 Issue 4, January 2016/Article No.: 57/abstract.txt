GP-SIMD, a novel hybrid general-purpose SIMD architecture, addresses the challenge of data synchronization by in-memory computing, through combining data storage and massive parallel processing. In this article, we explore a resistive implementation of the GP-SIMD architecture. In resistive GP-SIMD, a novel resistive row and column addressable 4F2crossbar is utilized, replacing the modified CMOS 190F2SRAM storage previously proposed for GP-SIMD architecture. The use of the resistive crossbar allows scaling the GP-SIMD from few millions to few hundred millions of processing units on a single silicon die. The performance, power consumption and power efficiency of a resistive GP-SIMD are compared with the CMOS version. We find that PiM architectures and, specifically, GP-SIMD benefit more than other many-core architectures from using resistive memory. A framework for in-place arithmetic operation on a single multivalued resistive cell is explored, demonstrating a potential to become a building block for next-generation PiM architectures.
