Phase Change Memory (PCM) devices are one of the known promising technologies to take the place of DRAM devices with the aim of overcoming the obstacles of reducing feature size and stopping ever growing amounts of leakage power. In exchange for providing high capacity, high density, and nonvolatility, PCM Multilevel Cells (MLCs) impose high write energy and long latency. Many techniques have been proposed to resolve these side effects. However, read performance issues are usually left behind the great importance of write latency, energy, and lifetime. In this article, we focus on read performance and improve the critical path latency of the main memory system. To this end, we exploit striping scheme by which multiple lines are grouped and lie on a single MLC line array. In order to achieve more performance gain, an adaptive ordering mechanism is used to sort lines in a group based on their read frequency. This scheme imposes large energy and lifetime overheads due to its intensive demand for higher write bandwidth. Thus, we equipped our design with a grouping/pairing write queue to synchronize write-back requests such that all updates to an MLC array occur at once. The design is also augmented by a directional write scheme that takes benefits of the uniformity of accesses to the PCM device—caused by the large DRAM cache—to determine the writing mode (striped or nonstriped). This adaptation to write operations relaxes the energy and lifetime overheads. We improve the read latency of a 2-bit MLC PCM memory by more than 24&percnt; (and Instructions Per Cycle (IPC) by about 9&percnt;) and energy-delay product by about 20&percnt; for a small lifetime degradation of 8&percnt;, on average.
