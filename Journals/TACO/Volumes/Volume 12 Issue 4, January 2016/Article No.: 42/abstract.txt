In this article, we propose a general framework for fine-grain application-aware task management in heterogeneous embedded platforms, which allows integration of different mechanisms for an efficient resource utilization, frequency scaling, and task migration. The proposed framework incorporates several components for accurate runtime monitoring by relying on the OS facilities and performance self-reporting for parallel and iterative applications. The framework efficiency is experimentally evaluated on a real hardware platform, where significant power and energy savings are attained for SPEC CPU2006 and PARSEC benchmarks, by guiding frequency scaling and intercluster migrations according to the runtime application behavior and predefined performance targets.
