The inclusive permissions structure (e.g., the Intel ring model) of modern commodity CPUs provides privileged system software layers with arbitrary permissions to access and modify client processes, allowing them to manage these clients and the system resources efficiently. Unfortunately, these inclusive permissions allow a compromised high-privileged software layer to perform arbitrary malicious activities. In this article, our goal is to prevent attacks that cross system layers while maintaining the abilities of system software to manage the system and allocate resources. In particular, we present a hardware-supported page permission framework for physical pages that is based on the concept of noninclusive sets of memory permissions for different layers of system software (such as hypervisors, operating systems, and user-level applications). Instead of viewing privilege levels as an ordered hierarchy with each successive level being more privileged, we view them as distinct levels each with its own set of permissions. In order to enable system software to manage client processes, we define a set of legal permission transitions that support resource allocation but preserve security. We show that the model prevents a range of recent attacks. We also show that it can be implemented with negligible performance overhead (both at load time and at runtime), low hardware complexity, and minimal changes to the commodity OS and hypervisor code.
