The addition of express channels to a traditional mesh network-on-chip (NoC) has emerged as a viable solution to solve the problem of high latency. In this article, we address the problem of integrated mapping and synthesis for express channel--based mesh NoC topologies. An integer linear programming--based formulation has been presented for the mapping problem followed by a constructive heuristic for simultaneous application mapping and synthesis for an express channel--based NoC. The static and dynamic simulation results indicate that the obtained mappings lead to significant reduction in both average packet delay and network energy consumption. The obtained synthesized topologies were also found to be much more power efficient compared to conventional express channel topologies.
