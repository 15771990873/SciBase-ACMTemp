Hardware Transactional Memory (HTM) relies heavily on the on-chip network for intertransaction communication. However, the network bandwidth utilization of transactions has been largely neglected in HTM designs. In this work, we propose a cost model to analyze network bandwidth in transaction execution. The cost model identifies a set of key factors that can be optimized through system design to reduce the communication cost of HTM. Based on the model and network traffic characterization of a representative HTM design, we identify a huge source of superfluous traffic due to failed requests in transaction conflicts. As observed in a spectrum of workloads, 39&percnt; of the transactional requests fail due to conflicts, which renders 58&percnt; of the transactional network traffic futile. To combat this pathology, a novel in-network filtering mechanism is proposed. The on-chip router is augmented to predict conflicts among transactions and proactively filter out those requests that have a high probability to fail. Experimental results show the proposed mechanism reduces total network traffic by 24&percnt; on average for a set of high-contention TM applications, thereby reducing energy consumption by an average of 24&percnt;. Meanwhile, the contention in the coherence directory is reduced by 68&percnt;, on average. These improvements are achieved with only 5&percnt; area added to a conventional on-chip router design.
