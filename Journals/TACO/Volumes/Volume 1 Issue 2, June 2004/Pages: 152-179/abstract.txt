To better address power concerns, a good design strategy should be flexible enough to dynamically reconfigure available resources according to the application's needs such that extra power is dissipated only when it is really needed. In this work, we focus on power-aware solutions for the issue queue (IQ) in an out-of-order superscalar processor. We propose two schemes that partition the IQ into FIFOs such that only the instructions at the head of each FIFO may request to issue. We then monitor the processor and dynamically vary the number and/or size of FIFOs in accordance with utilization. Experimenting with two different distributions in power dissipation, we show up to 69&percnt; reduction in power dissipation in the wakeup and arbitration loop, while constraining performance degradation to be no more than 5&percnt;.
