Given two spatial datasetsP(e.g., facilities) andQ(queries), anaggregate nearest neighbor(ANN) query retrieves the point(s) ofPwith the smallest aggregate distance(s) to points inQ. Assuming, for example,nusers at locationsq1,…qn, an ANN query outputs the facilityp∈Pthat minimizes thesumof distances &verbar;pqi&verbar; for 1 ≤i≤nthat the users have to travel in order to meet there. Similarly, another ANN query may report the pointp∈Pthat minimizes themaximumdistance that any user has to travel, or theminimumdistance from some user to his/her closest facility. IfQfits in memory andPis indexed by an R-tree, we develop algorithms for aggregate nearest neighbors that capture several versions of the problem, including weighted queries and incremental reporting of results. Then, we analyze their performance and propose cost models for query optimization. Finally, we extend our techniques for disk-resident queries and approximate ANN retrieval. The efficiency of the algorithms and the accuracy of the cost models are evaluated through extensive experiments with real and synthetic datasets.
