Recently developed inferential database systems face some common problems: a very fast growth of search space and difficulties in recognizing inference termination (especially for recursive axioms). These shortcomings stem mainly from the fact that the inference process is usually separated from database operations. A problem-oriented inferential system i8 described which refers to the database prior to query (or subquery) processing, so that the inference from the very beginning is directed by data relevant to the query. A multiprocessor implementation of the system is presented based on a computer network conforming to database relations and axioms. The system provides an efficient indication of query termination, and is complete in the sense that it produces all correct answers to a query in a finite time.
