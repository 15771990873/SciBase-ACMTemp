The problem of rewriting aggregate queries using views is studied for conjunctive queries with arbitrary aggregation functions and built-in predicates. Two types of queries over views are introduced for rewriting aggregate queries:pure candidatesandaggregate candidates. Pure candidates can be used to rewrite arbitrary aggregate queries. Aggregate candidates can be used to rewrite queries containing aggregate functions definable in terms of a commutative-semigroup operation. For both types of candidates (as well as for several relaxations of these candidates), theunfolding propertyholds. This allows characterizations for query equivalence to be used to determine whether a candidate is a rewriting of a query. The complexity of the rewriting-existence problem is also studied and upper and lower complexity bounds are given.
