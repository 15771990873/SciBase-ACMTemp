Simple chase join expressions are relational algebra expressions, involving only projection and join operators, defined on the basis of the functional dependencies associated with the database scheme. They are meaningful in the weak instance model, because for certain classes of schemes, including independent schemes, the total projections of the representative instance can be computed by means of unions of simple chase join expressions. We show how unions of simple chase join expressions can be optimized efficiently, without constructing and chasing the corresponding tableaux. We also present efficient algorithms for testing containment and equivalence, and for optimizing individual simple chase join expressions.
