A means by which ordinary forms can be exploited to provide a basis for nonprocedural specification of information processing is discussed. The Natural Forms Query Language (NFQL) is defined. In NFQL data retrieval requests and computation specifications are formulated by sketching ordinary forms to show what data are desired and update operations are specified by altering data on filled-in forms. The meaning of a form depends on a store of knowledge that includes extended abstract data types for defining elementary data items, a database scheme defined by an entity-relationship model, and a conceptual model of an ordinary form. Based on this store of knowledge, several issues are addressed and resolved in the context of NFQL. These issues include automatic generation of query expressions from weak specifications, the view update problem, power and completeness, and a heuristic approach to resolving computational relationships. A brief status report of an implementation of NFQL is also given.
