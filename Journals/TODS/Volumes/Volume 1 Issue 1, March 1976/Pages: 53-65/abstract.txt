The design and motivation for a rotating associative relational store (RARES) is described. RARES is designed to enhance the performance of an optimizing relational query interface by supporting important high level optimization techniques. In particular, it can perform tuple selection operations at the storage device and also can provide a mechanism for efficient sorting. Like other designs for rotating associative stores, RARES contains search logic which is attached to the heads of a rotating head-per-track storage device. RARES is distinct from other designs in that it utilizes a novel “orthogonal” storage layout. This layout allows a high output rate of selected tuples even when a sort order in the stored relation must be preserved. As in certain other designs, RARES can usually output a tuple as soon as it is found to satisfy the selection criteria. However, relative to these designs, the orthogonal layout allows an order of magnitude reduction in the capacity of storage local to the search logic.
