A facility is described for the implementation of database management systems having high degrees ofhorizontaldata independence, i.e. independence from chosen logical properties of a database as opposed toverticalindependence from storage structures. The facility consists of a high level language for the specification of virtual database managers, a compiler from this language to a pseudomachine language, and an interpreter for the pseudomachine language.It is shown how this facility can be used to produce efficient database management systems with any degree of both horizontal and vertical data independence. Two key features of this tool are the compilation of tailored database managers from individual schemas and multiple levels of optional binding.
