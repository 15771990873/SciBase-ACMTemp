The problems of file allocation and capacity assignment in a fixed topology distributed computer network are examined. These two aspects of the design are tightly coupled by means of an average message delay constraint. The objective is to allocate copies of information files to network nodes and capacities to network links so that a minimum cost is achieved subject to network delay and file availability constraints. A model for solving the problem is formulated and the resulting optimization problem is shown to fall into a class of nonlinear integer programming problems. Deterministic techniques for solving this class of problems are computationally cumbersome, even for small size problems. A new heuristic algorithm is developed, which is based on a decomposition technique that greatly reduces the computational complexity of the problem. Numerical results for a variety of network configurations indicate that the heuristic algorithm, while not theoretically convergent, yields practicable low cost solutions with substantial savings in computer processing time and storage requirements. Moreover, it is shown that this algorithm is capable of solving realistic network problems whose solutions using deterministic techniques are computationally intractable.
