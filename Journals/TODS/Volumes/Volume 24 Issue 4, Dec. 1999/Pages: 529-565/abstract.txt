Information dissemination is a powerful mechanism for finding information in wide-area environments. An information dissemination server accepts long-term user queries, collects new documents from information sources, matches the documents against the queries, and continuously updates the users with relevant information. This paper is a retrospective of the Stanford Information Filtering Service (SIFT), a system that as of April 1996 was processing over 40,000 worldwide subscriptions and over 80,000 daily documents. The paper describes some of the indexing mechanisms that were developed for SIFT, as well as the evaluations that were conducted to select a scheme to implement. It also describes the implementation of SIFT, and experimental results for the actual system. Finally, it also discusses and experimentally evaluates techniques for distributing a service such as SIFT for added performance and availability.
