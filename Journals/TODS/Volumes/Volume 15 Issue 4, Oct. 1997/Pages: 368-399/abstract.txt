In information-filtering environments, uncertainties associated with changing interests of the user and the dynamic document stream must be handled efficiently. In this article, a filtering model is proposed that decomposes the overall task into subsystem functionalities and highlights the need for multiple adaptation techniques to cope with uncertainties. A filtering system, SIFTER, has been implemented based on the model, using established techniques in information retrieval and artificial intelligence. These techniques include document representation by a vector-space model, document classification by unsupervised learning, and user modeling by reinforcement learning. The system can filter information based on content and a user's specific interests. The user's interests are automatically learned with only limited user intervention in the form of optional relevance feedback for documents. We also describe experimental studies conducted with SIFTER to filter computer and information science documents collected from the Internet and commercial database services. The experimental results demonstrate that the system performs very well in filtering documents in a realistic problem setting.
