The paper proposes a shift-register memory, structured as a two-dimensional array of uniform shift-register loops which are linked by flow-steering switches, whose switch control scheme is tailored to perform with great efficiency data management operations on sequentially organized files. The memory operates in a linear input/output mode to perform record insertion, deletion, and relocation on an existing file, and in a sublinear mode for rapid internal file movement to expedite file positioning and record retrieval and update operations.The memory, implemented as a large capacity charge-coupled device or magnetic domain memory, permits efficient data management on very large databases at the level of secondary storage and lends itself to applications as a universal disk replacement, particularly in database computers.
