A new on-line query language and storage structure for a database machine is presented. By including a mathematical model in the interpreter the query language has been substantially simplified so that no reference to relation names is necessary. By storing the model as a single joined normal form (JNF) file, it has been possible to exploit the powerful search capability of the Content Addressable File Store (CAFSÂ®; CAFS is a registered trademark of International Computers Limited) database machine.
