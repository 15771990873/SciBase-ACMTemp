We define a series of locking protocols for database systems that all have three main features: freedom from deadlock, multiple granularity, and support for general collections of locking primitives. A rooted directed acyclic graph is used to represent multiple granularities, as in System R. Deadlock freedom is guaranteed by extending the System R protocol to require locks on edges of the graph in addition to the locks required on nodes.
