Disk drives with movable two-headed arms are now commercially available. The two heads are separated by a fixed number of cylinders. A major problem for optimizing disk head movement, when answering database requests, is the specification of the optimum number of cylinders separating the two heads. An earlier analytical study assumed a FCFS model and concluded that the optimum separation distance should be equal to 0.44657 of the number of cylindersNof the disk. This paper considers that the SCAN scheduling policy is used in file access, and it applies combinatorial analysis to derive exact formulas for the expected head movement. Furthermore, it is proven that the optimum separation distance isN/2- 1 (⌈N/2 - 1⌉ and ⌊N/2 - 1⌋) ifNis even (odd). In addition, a comparison with a single-headed disk system operating under the same scheduling policy shows that if the two heads are optimally spaced, then the mean seek distance is less than one-half of the value obtained with one head. In fact that the SCAN policy is used for many database applications (for example,batching and secondary key retrieval) demonstrates the potential of two-headed disk systems for improving the performance of database systems.
