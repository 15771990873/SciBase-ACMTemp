Multilevel atomicity, a new correctness criteria for database concurrency control, is defined. It weakens the usual notion of serializability by permitting controlled interleaving among transactions. It appears to be especially suitable for applications in which the set of transactions has a natural hierarchical structure based on the hierarchical structure of an organization. A characterization for multilevel atomicity, in terms of the absence of cycles in a dependency relation among transaction steps, is given. Some remarks are made concerning implementation.
