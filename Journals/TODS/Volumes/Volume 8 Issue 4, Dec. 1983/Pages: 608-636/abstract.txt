Database relations which possibly contain maybe-tuples and null values of type “value at present unknown” are studied. Maybe-tuples and null values are formally interpreted by our notion ofrepresentation, which uses classical notions of predicate logic, elaborates Codd's proposal of maybe-tuples, and adopts Reiter's concept of a closed world. Precise notions ofinformation contentandredundancy, associated with our notion of representation, are investigated.Extensions of the relational algebrato relations with maybe-tuples and null values are proposed. Our extensions are essentially Codd's, with some modifications. It is proved that these extensions have natural properties which are formally stated as beingadequateandrestricted.By the treatment of difference and division, our formal framework can be used even for operations that require “negative information.” Finally, extensions ofupdate operationsare discussed.
