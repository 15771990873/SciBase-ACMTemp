A major requirement of a Distributed DataBase Management System (DDBMS) is to enable users to write queries as though the database were not distributed (distribution transparency). The DDBMS transforms the user's queries into execution strategies, that is, sequences of operations on the various nodes of the network and of transmissions between them. An execution strategy on a distributed database is correct if it returns the same result as if the query were applied to a nondistributed database.This paper analyzes the correctness problem for query execution strategies. A formal model, called Multirelational Algebra, is used as a unifying framework for this purpose. The problem of proving the correctness of execution strategies is reduced to the problem of proving the equivalence of two expressions of Multirelational Algebra. A set of theorems on equivalence is given in order to facilitate this task.The proposed approach can be used also for the generation of correct execution strategies, because it defines the rules which allow the transformation of a correct strategy into an equivalent one. This paper does not deal with the problem of evaluating equivalent strategies, and therefore is not in itself a proposal for a query optimizer for distributed databases. However, it constitutes a theoretical foundation for the design of such optimizers.
