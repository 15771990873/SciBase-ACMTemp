We present a new algorithm for duplicate document detection that
uses collection statistics. We compare our approach with the
state-of-the-art approach using multiple collections. These
collections include a 30 MB 18,577 web document collection
developed by Excite@Home and three NIST collections. The first NIST
collection consists of 100 MB 18,232 LA-Times documents, which is
roughly similar in the number of documents to the
Excite&at;Home collection. The other two collections are both 2
GB and are the 247,491-web document collection and the TREC disks 4
and 5---528,023 document collection. We show that our approach
called I-Match, scales in terms of the number of documents and
works well for documents of all sizes. We compared our solution to
the state of the art and found that in addition to improved
accuracy of detection, our approach executed in roughly one-fifth
the time.
