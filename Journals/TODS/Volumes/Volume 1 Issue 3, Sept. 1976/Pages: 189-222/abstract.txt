The currently operational (March 1976) version of the INGRES database management system is described. This multiuser system gives a relational view of data, supports two high level nonprocedural data sublanguages, and runs as a collection of user processes on top of the UNIX operating system for Digital Equipment Corporation PDP 11/40, 11/45, and 11/70 computers. Emphasis is on the design decisions and tradeoffs related to (1) structuring the system into processes, (2) embedding one command language in a general purpose programming language, (3) the algorithms implemented to process interactions, (4) the access methods implemented, (5) the concurrency and recovery control currently provided, and (6) the data structures used for system catalogs and the role of the database administrator.Also discussed are (1) support for integrity constraints (which is only partly operational), (2) the not yet supported features concerning views and protection, and (3) future plans concerning the system.
