We present a conceptual framework in which a database's intra- and interrecord set access requirements are specified as a constrained assignment of abstract characteristics (“evaluated,” “indexed,” “clustered,” “well-placed”) to logical access paths. We derive a physical schema by choosing an available storage structure that most closely provides the desired access characteristics. We use explicit replication of schema objects to reduce the access cost along certain paths, and analyze the trade-offs between increased update overhead and improved retrieval access. Finally, we given an algorithm to select storage structures for a CODASYL 78 DBTG schema, given its access requirements specification.
