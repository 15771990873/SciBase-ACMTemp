Access methods based on signature files can largely benefit from possibilities offered by parallel environments. To this end, an effectivedeclusteringstrategy that would distribute signatures over a set of parallel independent disks has to be combined with a synergicclusteringwhich is employed to avoid searching the whole signature file while executing a query. This article proposes two parallel signature file organizations, Hamming Filter (HF) and Hamming+Filter (H+F), whose common declustering strategy is based onerror correcting codes, and where clustering is achieved by organizing signatures into fixed-size buckets, each containing signatures sharing the samekeyvalue.HFallocates signatures on disks in a static way and works well if a correct relationship holds between the parameters of the code and the size of the file.H+Fis a generalization ofHFsuitable to manage highly dynamic files. It uses a dynamic declustering, obtained through asequenceof codes, and organizes a smooth migration of signatures between disks so that high performance levels are retained regardless of current file size. Theoretical analysis characterizes the best-case, expected, and worst-case behaviors of these organizations. Analytical results are verified by experiments on prototype systems.
