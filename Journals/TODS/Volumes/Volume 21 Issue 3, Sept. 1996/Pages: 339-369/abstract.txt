Although the relational model for databases provides a great range of advantages over other data models, it lacks a comprehensive way to handle incomplete and uncertain data. Uncertainty in data values, however, is pervasive in all real-world environments and has received much attention in the literature. Several methods have been proposed for incorporating uncertain data into relational databases. However, the current approaches have many shortcomings and have not established an acceptable extension of the relational model. In this paper, we propose a consistent extension of the relational model. We present a revised relational structure and extend the relational algebra. The extended algebra is shown to be closed, a consistent extension of the conventional relational algebra, and reducible to the latter.
