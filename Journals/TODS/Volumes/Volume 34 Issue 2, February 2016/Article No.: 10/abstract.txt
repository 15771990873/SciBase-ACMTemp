Volunteers have always been extremely crucial and in urgent need for nonprofit organizations (NPOs) to sustain their continuing operations. However, it is expensive and time-consuming to recruit volunteers using traditional approaches. In the Web 2.0 era, abundant and ubiquitous social media data opens a door to the possibility of automatic volunteer identification. In this article, we aim to fully explore this possibility by proposing a scheme that is able to predict usersâ€™ volunteerism tendency from user-generated contents collected from multiple social networks based on a conceptual volunteering decision model. We conducted comprehensive experiments to investigate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme and further discussed its generalizibility and extendability. This novel interdisciplinary research will potentially inspire more promising and important human-centered applications.
