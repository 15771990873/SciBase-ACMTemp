B-trees have been ubiquitous in database management systems for several decades, and they are used in other storage systems as well. Their basic structure and basic operations are well and widely understood including search, insertion, and deletion. Concurrency control of operations in B-trees, however, is perceived as a difficult subject with many subtleties and special cases. The purpose of this survey is to clarify, simplify, and structure the topic of concurrency control in B-trees by dividing it into two subtopics and exploring each of them in depth.
