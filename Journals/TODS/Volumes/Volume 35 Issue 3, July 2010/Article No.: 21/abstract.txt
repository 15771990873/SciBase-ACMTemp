We investigate the question of whether a queryQcan be answered using a setVof views. We first define the problem in information-theoretic terms: we say thatVdeterminesQifVprovides enough information to uniquely determine the answer toQ. Next, we look at the problem of rewritingQin terms ofVusing a specific language. Given a view languageVand query languageQ, we say that a rewriting languageRis complete forV-to-Qrewritings if everyQ∈Qcan be rewritten in terms ofV∈Vusing a query inR, wheneverVdeterminesQ. While query rewriting using views has been extensively investigated for some specific languages, the connection to the information-theoretic notion of determinacy, and the question of completeness of a rewriting language have received little attention. In this article we investigate systematically the notion of determinacy and its connection to rewriting. The results concern decidability of determinacy for various view and query languages, as well as the power required of complete rewriting languages. We consider languages ranging from first-order to conjunctive queries.
