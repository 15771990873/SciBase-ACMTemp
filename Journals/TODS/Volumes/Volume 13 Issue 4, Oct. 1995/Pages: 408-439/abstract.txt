Like other types of digital information, video sequences must be classified based on the semantics of their contents. A more-precise and completer extraction of semantic information will result in a more-effective classification. The most-discernible difference between still images and moving pictures stems from movements and variations. Thus, to go from the realm of still-image repositories to video databases, we must be able to deal with motion. Particularly, we need the ability to classify objects appearing in a video sequence based on their characteristics and features such as shape or color, as well as their movements. By describing the movements that we derive from the process of motion analysis, we introduce a dual hierarchy consisting of spatial and  temporal parts for video sequence representation. This gives us the flexibility to examine arbitrary sequences of frames at various levels of abstraction and to retrieve the associated temporal information (say, object trajectories) in addition to the spatial representation. Our algorithm for motion detection uses the motion compensation component of the MPEG video-encoding scheme and then computes trajectories for objects of interest. The specification of a language for retrieval of video based on the spatial as well as motion characteristics is presented.
