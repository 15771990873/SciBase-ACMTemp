An increasing number of companies are introducing computer technology into more aspects of work. Effective use of information systems to support office and service work can improve staff productivity, broaden a company's market, or dramatically change its business. It can also increase the extent to which work is computer mediated and thus within the reach of software known as Computerized Performance Monitoring and Control Systems (CPMCSs). Virtually all research has studied CPMCSs as unidimensional systems. Employees are described as “monitored” or “unmonitored” or as subject to “high,” “moderate,” or “low” levels of monitoring. Research that does not clearly distinguish among possible monitor design cannot explain how  designs may differ in effect. Nor can it suggest how to design better monitors. A multidimensional view of CPMCSs describes monitor designs in terms of object of measurements, tasks measured, recipient of data, reporting period, and message content. This view is derived from literature in control systems, organizational behavior, and management information systems. The multidimensional view can then be incorporated into causal models to explain contradictory results of earlier CPMCS research.
