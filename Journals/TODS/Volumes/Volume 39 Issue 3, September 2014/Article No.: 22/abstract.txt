We present efficient algorithms for releasing useful statistics about graph data while providing rigorous privacy guarantees. Our algorithms work on datasets that consist of relationships between individuals, such as social ties or email communication. The algorithms satisfyedge differential privacy, which essentially requires that the presence or absence of any particular relationship be hidden.Our algorithms output approximate answers tosubgraph counting queries. Given a query graphH, for example, a triangle,k-star, ork-triangle, the goal is to return the number of edge-induced isomorphic copies ofHin the input graph. The special case of triangles was considered by Nissim et al. [2007] and a more general investigation of arbitrary query graphs was initiated by Rastogi et al. [2009]. We extend the approach of Nissim et al. to a new class of statistics, namelyk-star queries. We also give algorithms fork-triangle queries using a different approach based on the higher-order local sensitivity. For the specific graph statistics we consider (i.e.,k-stars andk-triangles), we significantly improve on the work of Rastogi et al.: our algorithms satisfy a stronger notion of privacy that does not rely on the adversary having a particular prior distribution on the data, and add less noise to the answers before releasing them.We evaluate the accuracy of our algorithms both theoretically and empirically, using a variety of real and synthetic datasets. We give explicit, simple conditions under which these algorithms add a small amount of noise. We also provide the average-case analysis in the Erd&odblac;s-RÃ©nyi-GilbertG(n,p) random graph model.Finally, we give hardness results indicating that the approach Nissim et al. used for triangles cannot easily be extended tok-triangles (hence justifying our development of a new algorithmic approach).
