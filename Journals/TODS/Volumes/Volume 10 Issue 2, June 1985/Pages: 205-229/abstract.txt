We propose a new class of schedulers, calledcautious schedulers, that grant an input request if it will not necessitate any rollback in the future. In particular, we investigate cautious WRW-schedulers that output schedules in class WRW only. Class WRW consists of all schedules that are serializable, while preserving the write-read and read-write conflict, and is the largest polynomiallyrecognizablesubclass of serializable schedules currently known. It is shown, in this paper however, that cautious WRW-schedulingis, in general, NP-complete. Therefore, we introduce a special type (type 1R) of transaction, which consists of no more than one read step (an indivisible set of read operations) followed by multiple write steps. It is shown that cautious WRW-scheduling can be performed efficiently if all transactions are of type 1R and ifadmission controlcan be exercised. Admission control rejects a transaction unless its first request is immediately grantable.
