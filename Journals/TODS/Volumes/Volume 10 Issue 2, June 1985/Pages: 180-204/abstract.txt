An algorithm for record clustering is presented. It is capable of detecting sudden changes in users' access patterns and then suggesting an appropriate assignment of records to blocks. It is conceptually simple, highly intuitive, does not need to classify queries into types, and avoids collecting individual query statistics. Experimental results indicate that it converges rapidly; its performance is about 50 percent better than that of the total sort method, and about 100 percent better than that of randomly assigning records to blocks.
