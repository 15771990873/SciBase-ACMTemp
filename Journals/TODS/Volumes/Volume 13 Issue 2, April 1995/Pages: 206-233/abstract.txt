Exceptions, situations that cannot be correctly processed by computer systems, occur frequently in computer-based information processes. Five perspectives on exceptions provide insights into why exceptions occur and how they might be eliminated or more efficiently handled. We investigate these perspectives using an in-depth study of an operating information process that has frequent exceptions. Our results support the use of a total quality management (TQM) approach of eliminating exceptions for some exceptions, in particular, those caused by computer systems that are poor matches to organizational processes. However, some exceptions are explained better by a political system perspective of conflicting goals between subunits. For these exceptions and several other types, designing an integrated human-computer process will provide better performance than will eliminating exceptions and moving toward an entirely automated process.
