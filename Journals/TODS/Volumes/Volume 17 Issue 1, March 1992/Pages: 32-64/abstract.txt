We propose a more general form of functional dependency for semantic data models that derives from their common feature in which the separate notions ofdomainandrelationin the relational model are combined into a single notion ofclass. This usually results in a richer terminological component for their query languages, whereby terms may navigate through any number of properties, including none. We prove the richer expressiveness of this more general functional dependency, and exhibit a sound and complete set of inference axioms. Although the general problem of decidability of their logical implication remains open at this time, we present decision procedures for cases in which the dependencies included in a schema correspond to  keys, or in which the schema itself is acyclic. The theory is then extended to include a form of conjunctive query. Of particular significance is that the query becomes an additional source of functional dependency. Finally, we outline several applications of the theory to various problems in physical design and in query optimization. The applications derive from an ability to predict when a query can have at most one solution.
