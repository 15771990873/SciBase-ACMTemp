Spatio-temporal data concerning the movement of individuals over space and time contains latent information on the associations among these individuals. Sources of spatio-temporal data include usage logs of mobile and Internet technologies. This article defines a spatio-temporal event by the co-occurrences among individuals that indicate potential associations among them. Each spatio-temporal event is assigned a weight based on the precision and uniqueness of the event. By aggregating the weights of events relating two individuals, we can determine the strength of association between them. We conduct extensive experimentation to investigate both the efficacy of the proposed model as well as the computational complexity of the proposed algorithms. Experimental results on three real-life spatio-temporal datasets cross-validate each other, lending greater confidence on the reliability of our proposed model.
