The Constituent Object Parser is a shallow syntactic parser designed to produce dependency tree representations of syntactic structure that can be used to specify the intended meanings of a sentence more precisely than can the key terms of the sentence alone. It is intended to improve the precision/recall performance of information retrieval and similar text processing applications by providing more powerful matching procedures. The dependency tree representation and the relationship between the intended use of this parser and its design is described, and several problems concerning the processing of ambiguous structures are discussed.
