We present a view of hyperdocuments in which each document encodes its own browsing semantics in its links. This requires a mental shift in how a hyperdocument is thought of abstractly. Instead of treating the links of a document as defining a static directed graph, they are thought of as defining an abstract program, termed thelinks-automatonof the document. A branching temporal logic notation, termed HTL*, is introduced for specifying properties a document should exhibit during browsing. An automated program verification technique calledmodel checkingis used to verify that browsing specifications in a subset of HTL* are met by the behavior defined in the links-automation. We illustrate the generality of these techniques by applying them first to several Trellis documents and then to a Hyperties document.
