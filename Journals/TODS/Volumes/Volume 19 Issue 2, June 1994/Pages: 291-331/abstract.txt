The integration of knowledge for multiple sources is an important
aspect of automated reasoning systems. When different knowledge bases
are used to store knowledge provided by multiple sources, we are faced
with the  problem of integrating multiple knowledge bases: Under these
circumstances, we are also confronted with the prospect of
inconsistency. In this paper we present a uniform theoretical framework,
based onannotated logics, for
amalgamating multiple knowledge bases when these knowledge bases
(possibly) contain inconsistencies, uncertainties, and nonmonotonic
modes of negation. We show that annotated logics may be used, with some
modifications, tomediatebetween
different knowledge bases. The multiple knowledge bases are amalgamated
by a transformation of the individual knowledge bases into new annotated
logic programs, together with the addition of a new axiom scheme. We
characterize the declarative semantics of such amalgamated knowledge
bases and study how the semantics of the amalgam is related to the
semantics of the individual knowledge bases being combined.â€”Author's Abstract
