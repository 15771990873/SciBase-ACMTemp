The number, size, and user population of bibliographic and full-text document databases are rapidly growing. With a high document arrival rate, it becomes essential for users of such databases to have access to the very latest documents; yet the high document arrival rate also makes it difficult for users to keep themselves updated. It is desirable to allow users to submit profiles, i.e., queries that are constantly evaluated, so that they will be automatically informed of new additions that may be of interest. Such service is traditionally called Selective Dissemination of Information (SDI).The high document arrival rate, the huge number of users, and the timeliness requirement of the service pose a challenge in achieving efficient SDL. In this article, we propose several index structures for indexing profiles and algorithms that efficiently match documents against large number of profiles. We also present analysis and simulation results to compare their performance under different scenarios.
