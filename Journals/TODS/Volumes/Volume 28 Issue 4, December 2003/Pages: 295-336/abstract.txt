Given a set of objectsS, a spatio-temporalwindow query qretrieves the objects ofSthat will intersect the window during the (future) intervalqT. Anearest neighbor query qretrieves the objects ofSclosest toqduringqT. Given a thresholdd, a spatio-temporaljoinretrieves the pairs of objects from two datasets that will come within distancedfrom each other duringqT. In this article, we present probabilistic cost models that estimate theselectivityof spatio-temporal window queries and joins, and theexpected distancebetween a query and its nearest neighbor(s). Our models capture any query/object mobility combination (moving queries, moving objects or both) and any data type (points and rectangles) in arbitrary dimensionality. In addition, we develop specialized spatio-temporal histograms, which take into account both location and velocity information, and can be incrementally maintained. Extensive performance evaluation verifies that the proposed techniques produce highly accurate estimation on both uniform and non-uniform data.
