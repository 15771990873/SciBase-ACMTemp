Data sharing is fundamental to computer-supported cooperative work: People share information through explicit communication channels and through their coordinated use of shared databases. This paper examines the data management requirements of group work applications on the basis of experience with three prototype systems and on observations from the literature. Database and object management technologies that support these requirements are briefly surveyed, and unresolved issues in the particular areas of access control and concurrency control are identified for future research.
