Dynamic hashing with deferred splitting is a file organization scheme which increases storage utilization, as compared to standard dynamic hashing. In this scheme, splitting of a bucket is deferred if the bucket is full but its brother can accommodate new records. The performance of the scheme is analyzed. In a typical case the expected storage utilization increases from 69 to 76 percent.
