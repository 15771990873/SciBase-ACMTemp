An overview of the existing and growing demands for wireless office information networks is provided, and the existing research activities are assessed in some detail. The radio frequency (RF) and infrared (IR) communication technologies are examined as candidates for wireless intraoffice communications. The available bandwidths, according to federal regulations and characteristics of the channel for RF communications, are given. Digital narrow-band and wideband spread-spectrum RF communications are assessed in terms of supportable data rate or number of simultaneous users in one cell of a cellular architecture in an office environment. Various limitations of IR communications are discussed and existing systems and architectures are reviewed.
