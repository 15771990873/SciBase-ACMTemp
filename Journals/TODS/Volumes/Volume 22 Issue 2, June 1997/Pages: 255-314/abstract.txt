This article addresses the performance of distributed database systems. Specifically, we present an algorithm for dynamic replication of an object in distributed systems. The algorithm is adaptive in the sence that it changes the replication scheme of the object i.e., the set of processors at which the object inreplicated) as changes occur in the read-write patern of the object (i.e., the number of reads and writes issued by each processor). The algorithm continuously moves the replication scheme towards an optimal one. We show that the algorithm can be combined with the concurrency control and recovery mechanisms of ta distributed database management system. The performance of the algorithm is analyzed theoretically and experimentally. On the way we provide a lower bound on the performance of any dynamic replication algorith.
