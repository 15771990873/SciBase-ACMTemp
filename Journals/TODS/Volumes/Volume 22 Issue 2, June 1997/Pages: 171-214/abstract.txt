Although “now” is expressed in SQL and CURRENT_TIMESTAMP within queries, this value cannot be stored in the database. How ever, this notion of an ever-increasing current-time value has been reflected in some temporal data models by inclusion of database-resident variables, such as “now” “until-changed,” “**,” “@,” and “-”. Time variables are very desirable, but their used also leads to a new type of database, consisting of tuples with variables, termed avariable database.
