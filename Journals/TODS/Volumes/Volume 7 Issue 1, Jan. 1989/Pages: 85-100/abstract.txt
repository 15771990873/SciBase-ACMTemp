Hypertext and other page-oriented databases cannot be schematized in the same manner as record-oriented databases. As a result, most hypertext databases implicitly employ a data model based on a simple, unrestricted graph. This paper presents a hypergraph model for maintaining page-oriented databases in such a way that some of the functionality traditionally provided by database schemes can be available to hypertext databases. In particular, the model formalizes identification of commonality in the structure, set-at-a-time database access, and definition of user-specific views. An efficient implementation of the model is also discussed.
