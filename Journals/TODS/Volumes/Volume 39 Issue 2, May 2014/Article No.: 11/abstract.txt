As more data management software is designed for deployment in public and private clouds, or on a cluster of commodity servers, new distributed storage systems increasingly achieve high data access throughput via partitioning and replication. In order to achieve high scalability, however, today's systems generally reduce transactional support, disallowing single transactions from spanning multiple partitions.This article describes Calvin, a practical transaction scheduling and data replication layer that uses a deterministic ordering guarantee to significantly reduce the normally prohibitive contention costs associated with distributed transactions. This allows near-linear scalability on a cluster of commodity machines, without eliminating traditional transactional guarantees, introducing a single point of failure, or requiring application developers to reason about data partitioning. By replicating transaction inputs instead of transactional actions, Calvin is able to support multiple consistency levels—including Paxos-based strong consistency across geographically distant replicas—at no cost to transactional throughput.Furthermore, Calvin introduces a set of tools that will allow application developers to gain the full performance benefit of Calvin's server-side transaction scheduling mechanisms without introducing the additional code complexity and inconvenience normally associated with using DBMS stored procedures in place of ad hoc client-side transactions.
