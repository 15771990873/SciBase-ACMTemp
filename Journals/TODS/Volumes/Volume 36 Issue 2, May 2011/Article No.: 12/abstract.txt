Skyline computation is widely used in multicriteria decision making. As research in uncertain databases draws increasing attention, skyline queries with uncertain data have also been studied. Some earlier work focused on probabilistic skylines with a given threshold; Atallah and Qi [2009] studied the problem to compute skyline probabilities for all instances of uncertain objects without the use of thresholds, and proposed an algorithm with subquadratic time complexity. In this work, we propose a new algorithm for computing all skyline probabilities that is asymptotically faster: worst-caseO(n&sqrt;nlogn) time andO(n)space for 2D data;O(n2−1/dlogd−1n) time andO(nlogd−2n) space ford-dimensional data. Furthermore, we study the online version of the problem: Given any query pointp(unknown until the query time), return the probability that no instance in the given data set dominatesp. We propose an algorithm for answering such an online query ford-dimensional data inO(n1−1/dlogd−1n) time after preprocessing the data inO(n2−1/dlogd−1) time and space.
