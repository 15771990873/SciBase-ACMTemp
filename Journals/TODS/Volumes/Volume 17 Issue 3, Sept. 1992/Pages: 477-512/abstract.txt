We study a deadlock-free locking-based concurrency control algorithm, calledcautious waiting, which allows for a limited form of waiting. The algorithm is very simple to implement. We present an analytical solution to its performance evaluation based on the mean-value approach proposed by Tay et al. [18]. From the modeling point of view, we are able to do away with a major assumption used in Tay's previous work, and therefore capture more accurately both the restart and the blocking rates in the system. We show that to solve for this model we only need to solve for the root of a polynomial. The analytical tools developed enable us to see that the cautious waiting algorithm manages to achieve adelicatebalance between restart and blocking, and therefore is superior (i.e., has higher throughput toboththe no-waiting (i.e., immediate restart) and the general waiting algorithms under a wide range of system parameters. The study substantiates the argument that balancing restart and blocking is important in locking systems.
