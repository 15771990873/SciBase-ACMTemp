This article develops upper and lower bounds for the probability of Boolean functions by treating multiple occurrences of variables as independent and assigning them new individual probabilities. We call this approachdissociationand give an exact characterization ofoptimal oblivious bounds, that is, when the new probabilities are chosen independently of the probabilities of all other variables. Our motivation comes from theweighted model countingproblem (or, equivalently, the problem of computing the probability of a Boolean function), which is &num;P-hard in general. By performing several dissociations, one can transform a Boolean formula whose probability is difficult to compute into one whose probability is easy to compute, and which is guaranteed to provide an upper or lower bound on the probability of the original formula by choosing appropriate probabilities for the dissociated variables. Our new bounds shed light on the connection between previous relaxation-based and model-based approximations and unify them as concrete choices in a larger design space. We also show how our theory allows a standard relational database management system (DBMS) to both upper and lower bound hard probabilistic queries in guaranteed polynomial time.
