Inverted index structures are a core element of current text retrieval systems. They can be constructed quickly using offline approaches, in which one or more passes are made over a static set of input data, and, at the completion of the process, an index is available for querying. However, there are search environments in which even a small delay in timeliness cannot be tolerated, and the index must always be queryable and up to date. Here we describe and analyze ageometric partitioningmechanism for online index construction that provides a range of tradeoffs between costs, and can be adapted to different balances of insertion and querying operations. Detailed experimental results are provided that show the extent of these tradeoffs, and that these new methods can yield substantial savings in online indexing costs.
