A data model is presented, based on the extension of the concept of a DBTG owner-coupled set to permitstaticanddynamicsets and a new kind of set referred to as avirtualset. The notion ofconnection fieldsis introduced, and it is shown how connection fields may be used to construct derived information bearing set names, and hence permit the specification of (dynamic) sets which are not predeclared in a schema. Virtual sets are shown to reflect the functional dependencies which can exist within a file. A technique which permits the data model to be fully described diagrammatically byextended Bachman diagramsis described. A predicate calculus for manipulation of this data model is presented. Expressions written in this calculus are compared with corresponding expressions in a relational predicate calculus, DSL ALPHA. An argument for the relational completeness of the language is given.
