Databases are replicated to improve performance and availability. The notion of correctness that has commonly been adopted for concurrent access by transactions to shared, possibly replicated, data is serializability. However, serializability may be impractical in high-performance applications since it imposes too stringent a restriction on concurrency. When serializability is relaxed, the integrity constraints describing the data may be violated. By allowing bounded violations of the integrity constraints, however, we are able to increase the concurrency of transactions that execute in a replicated environment. In this article, we introduce the notion of anN-ignoranttransaction, which is a transaction that may be ignorant of the results of at mostNprior transactions, which is a transaction that may be ignorant of the results of at mostNprior transactions. A system in which all transactions areN-ignorantcan have anN+ 1-fold increase in concurrency over serializable systems, at the expense of bounded violations of its integrity constraints. We present algorithms for implementing replicated databases inN-ignorantsystems. We then provide constructive methods for calculating the reachable states in such systems, given the value ofN, so that one may assess the maximum liability that is incurred in allowing constraint violation. Finally, we generalize the notion ofN-ignoranceto a matrix of ignorance for the  purpose of higher concurrency.
