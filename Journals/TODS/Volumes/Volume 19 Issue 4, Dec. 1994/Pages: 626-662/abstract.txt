The addition of stringent security specifications to the list of requirements for an application poses many new problems in DBMS design and implementation, as well as database design, use, and maintenance. Tight security requirements, such as those that result in silent masking of witholding of true information from a user or the introduction of false information into query answers, also raise fundamental questions about the meaning of the database and the semantics of accompanying query languages. In this paper, we propose a belief-based semantics for secure databases, which provides a semantics for databases that can “lie” about the state of the world, or about their knowledge about the state of the world, in order to preserve security. This kind of semantics can be  used as a helpful retrofit for the proposals for a “multilevel secure” database model (a particularly stringent form of security), and may be useful for less restrictive security policies as well. We also propose a family of query languages for multilevel secure relational database applications, and base the semantics of those languages on our semantics for secure databases. Our query languages are free of the semantic problems associated with use of ordinary SQL in a multilevel secure context, and should be easy for users to understand and employ.
