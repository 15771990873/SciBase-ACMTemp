A common problem in many types of databases is retrieving the most similar matches to a query object. Finding these matches in a large database can be too slow to be practical, especially in domains where objects are compared using computationally expensive similarity (or distance) measures. Embedding methods can significantly speed-up retrieval by mapping objects into a vector space, where distances can be measured rapidly using a Minkowski metric. In this article we present a novel way to improve embedding quality. In particular, we propose to construct embeddings that use aquery-sensitivedistance measure for the target space of the embedding. This distance measure is used to compare those vectors that the query and database objects are mapped to. The term “query-sensitive” means that the distance measure changes, depending on the current query object. We demonstrate theoretically that using a query-sensitive distance measure increases the modeling power of embeddings and allows them to capture more of the structure of the original space. We also demonstrate experimentally that query-sensitive embeddings can significantly improve retrieval performance. In experiments with an image database of handwritten digits and a time-series database, the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art non-Euclidean indexing methods, meaning that it provides significantly better tradeoffs between efficiency and retrieval accuracy.
