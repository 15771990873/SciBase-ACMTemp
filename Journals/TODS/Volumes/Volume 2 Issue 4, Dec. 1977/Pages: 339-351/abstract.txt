Three models, corresponding to different sets of assumptions, are analyzed to study the behavior of a database buffer in a paging environment. The models correspond to practical situations and vary in their search strategies and replacement algorithms. The variation of I/O cost with respect to buffer size is determined for the three models. The analysis is valid for arbitrary database and buffer sizes, and the I/O cost is obtained in terms of the miss ratio, the buffer size, the number of main memory pages available for the buffer, and the relative buffer and database access costs.
