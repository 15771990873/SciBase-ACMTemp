RAP (Relational Associative Processor) is a “back-end” database processor that is intended to take over much of the effort of database management in a computer system. In order to enhance RAP's performance its design includes mechanisms for permitting features analogous to multiprogramming and virtual memory as in general purpose computer systems. It is the purpose of this paper to present the detailed design of these mechanisms, along with some analysis that supports their value. Specifically, (1) the response time provided by RAP under several scheduling disciplines involving priority by class is analyzed, (2) the cost effectiveness of the additional hardware in RAP necessary to support multiprogramming is assessed, and (3) a detailed design of the RAP virtual memory system and its monitor is presented.
