Providing computer facilities and data availability to larger numbers of users generates increased system vulnerability which is partially offset by software security systems. Much too often these systems are presented as ad hoc additions to the basic data management system. One very important constituent of software security systems is the access control mechanism which may be the last resource available to prohibit unauthorized data retrieval. This paper presents a specification for an access control mechanism. The mechanism is specified in a context for use with the GPLAN decision support system by a theoretical description consistent with the formal definition of GPLAN's query language. Incorporation of the mechanism into the language guarantees it will not be an ad hoc addition. Furthermore, it provides a facile introduction of data security dictates into the language processor.
