Expert systems are powerful tools that serve as adjuncts to decision making and have found wide applicability in a wide variety of areas. Integrating expert systems with group decision support systems has the potential to enhance the quality and effeciency of group communication, negotiation, and collaborative work. This paper examines possible synergies between the two technologies and provides a survey of current partially-integrated systems. Finally, a prototype design of a highly-integrated system is described with directions for further research.
