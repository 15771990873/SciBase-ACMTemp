Many algorithms have been devised for minimizing the costs associated with obtaining the answer to a single, isolated query in a distributed database system. However, if more than one query may be processed by the system at the same time and if the arrival times of the queries are unknown, the determination of optimal query-processing strategies becomes a stochastic optimization problem. In order to cope with such problems, a theoretical state-transition model is presented that treats the system as one operating under a stochastic load. Query-processing strategies may then be distributed over the processors of a network as probability distributions, in a manner which accommodates many queries over time.It is then shown that the model leads to the determination of optimal query-processing strategies as the solution of mathematical programming problems, and analytical results for several examples are presented. Furthermore, a divide-and-conquer approach is introduced for decomposing stochastic query optimization problems into distinct subproblems for processing queries sequentially and in parallel.
