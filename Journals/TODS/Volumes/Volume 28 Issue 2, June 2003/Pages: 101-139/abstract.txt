Conventional spatial queries are usually meaningless in dynamic environments since their results may be invalidated as soon as the query or data objects move. In this paper we formulate two novel query types,time parameterizedandcontinuous queries, applicable in such environments. A time-parameterized query retrieves theactual resultat the time when the query is issued, theexpiry timeof the result given the current motion of the query and database objects, and thechangethat causes the expiration. A continuous query retrieves tuples of the form <result,interval>, where eachresultis accompanied by a futureinterval, during which it is valid. We study time-parameterized and continuous versions of the most common spatial queries (i.e., window queries, nearest neighbors, spatial joins), proposing efficient processing algorithms and accurate cost models.
