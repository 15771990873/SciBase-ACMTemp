This paper presents the reliability mechanisms of SDD-1, a prototype distributed database system being developed by the Computer Corporation of America. Reliability algorithms in SDD-1 center around the concept of the Reliable Network (RelNet). The RelNet is a communications medium incorporating facilities for site status monitoring, event timestamping, multiply buffered message delivery, and the atomic control of distributed transactions.This paper is one of a series of companion papers on SDD-1 [3, 4, 6, 13].
