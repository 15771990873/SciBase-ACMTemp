SQL is a high-level nonprocedural data language which has received wide recognition in relational databases. One of the most interesting features of SQL is the nesting of query blocks to an arbitrary depth. An SQL-like query nested to an arbitrary depth is shown to be composed of five basic types of nesting. Four of them have not been well understood and more work needs to be done to improve their execution efficiency. Algorithms are developed that transform queries involving these basic types of nesting into semantically equivalent queries that are amenable to efficient processing by existing query-processing subsystems. These algorithms are then combined into a coherent strategy for processing a general nested query of arbitrary complexity.
