Most relational database systems provide a facility for supporting user views. Permitting this level of abstraction has the danger, however, that update requests issued by a user within the context of his view may not translate correctly into equivalent updates on the underlying database. The purpose of this paper is to formalize the notion of update translation and derive conditions under which translation procedures will produce correct translations of view updates.
