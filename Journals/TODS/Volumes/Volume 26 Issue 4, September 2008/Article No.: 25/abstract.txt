Peer review is an important resource of scholarly communities and must be managed and nurtured carefully. Electronic manuscript management systems have begun to improve some aspects of workflow for conferences and journals but also raise issues related to reviewer roles and reputations and the control of reviews over time. Professional societies should make their policies related to reviews and reviewer histories clear to authors and reviewers, develop strategies and tools to facilitate good and timely reviews, and facilitate the training of new reviewers.
