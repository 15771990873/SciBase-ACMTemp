Traditionally users access their personal files mainly by using
folder navigation. We evaluate whether recent improvements in
desktop search have changed this fundamental aspect of Personal
Information Management (PIM). We tested this in two studies using
the same questionnaire: (a) The Windows Studya longitudinal
comparison ofGoogle DesktopandWindows XP Search
Companion, and (b) The Mac Studya large scale comparison of MacSpotlightandSherlock. There were few effects for
improved search. First, regardless of search engine, there was a
strong navigation preference: on average, users estimated that they
used navigation for 56-68% of file retrieval events but searched
for only 4-15% of events. Second, the effect of improving the
quality of the search engine on search usage was limited and
inconsistent. Third, search was used mainly as a last resort when
users could not remember file location. Finally, there was no
evidence that using improved desktop search engines leads people to
change their filing habits to become less reliant on hierarchical
file organization. We conclude by offering theoretical explanations
for navigation preference, relating to differences between PIM and
Internet retrieval, and suggest alternative design directions for
PIM systems.
