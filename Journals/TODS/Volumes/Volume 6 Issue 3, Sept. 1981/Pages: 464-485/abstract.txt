This paper discusses some high-level language programming constructs that can be used to manipulate the relations of a relational database system efficiently. Three different constructs are described: (1) tuple identifiers that directly reference tuples of a relation; (2) cursors that may iterate over the tuples of a relation; and (3) markings, a form of temporary relation consisting of a set of tuple identifiers. In each case, attention is given to syntactic, semantic, and implementation considerations.The use of these features is first presented within the context of the programming language PLAIN, and it is then shown how these features could be used more generally to provide database manipulation capabilities in a high-level programming language. Consideration is also given to issues of programming methodology, with an important goal being the achievement of a balance between the enforcement of good programming practices and the ability to write efficient programs.
