Frame memory is a virtual view of secondary storage that can be implemented with reasonable overhead to support database record storage and accessing requirements. Frame memory is designed so that its operating characteristics can be easily manipulated by either designers or design algorithms, while performance effects of such changes can be accurately predicted. Automated design procedures exist to generate and evaluate alternative database designs built upon frame memory, and the existence of these procedures establishes frames as an attractive memory management architecture for future database management systems.
