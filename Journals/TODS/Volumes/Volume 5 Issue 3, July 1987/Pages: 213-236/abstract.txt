The design approach of a knowledge-based message management system is described. A linguistic message filter is used to filter out junk messages. Relevant messages are then processed by an expert system, driven by user-defined alerter rules. An alerter rule base for a secretarial office is illustrated. Further research topics in knowledge-base design, evaluation, and learning are also discussed.
