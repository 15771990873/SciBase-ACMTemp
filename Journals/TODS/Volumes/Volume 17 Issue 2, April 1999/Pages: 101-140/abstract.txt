In this article, we present an authorization model that can be used to express a number of discretionary access control policies for relational data management systems. The model permits both positive and negative authorizations and supports exceptions at the same time. The model is flexible in that the users can specify, for each authorization they grant, whether the authorization can allow for exceptions or whether it must be strongly obeyed. It provides authorization management for groups with exceptions at any level of the group hierarchy, and temporary suspension of authorizations. The model supports ownership together with decentralized administration of authorizations. Administrative privileges can also be restricted so that owners retain control over their tables.
