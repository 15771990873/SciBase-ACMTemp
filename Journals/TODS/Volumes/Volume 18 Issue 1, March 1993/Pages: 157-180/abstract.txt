We present an exact performance analysis, under random insertions, of file organizations that use multibucket data leaves and perform partial expansions before splitting. We evaluate the expected disk space utilization of the file and show how the expected search and insert costs can be estimated. The analytical results are confirmed by simulations. The analysis can be used to investigate both the dynamic and the asymptotic behaviors.
