The problem of disk allocation addresses the issue of how to distribute a file on several disks in order to maximize concurrent disk accesses in response to a partial match query. In this paper a coding-theoretic analysis of this problem is presented, and both necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of strictly optimal allocation methods are provided. Based on a class of optimal codes, known as maximum distance separable codes, strictly optimal allocation methods are constructed. Using the necessary conditions proved, we argue that the standard definition of strict optimality is too strong and cannot be attained, in general. Hence, we reconsider the definition of optimality. Instead of basing it on an abstract definition that may not be attainable, we propose a new definition based on the best possible allocation method. Using coding theory, allocation methods that are optimal according to our proposed criterion are developed.
