Database design is difficult because it involves a database designer understanding an application and translating the design requirements into a conceptual model. However, the designer may have little or no knowledge about the application or task for which the database is being designed. This research presents a methodology for supporting database design creation and evaluation that makes use of domain-specific knowledge about an application stored in the form of domain ontologies. The methodology is implemented in a prototype system, the Ontology Management and Database Design Environment. Initial testing of the prototype illustrates that the incorporation and use of ontologies is effective in creating entity-relationship models.
