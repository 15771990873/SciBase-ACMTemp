The concept of multidimensional transformation of statistical databases is described. A given set of statistical output may be compatible with more than one statistical database. A transformed databaseD' is a database which (1) differs from the original databaseDin its record content, but (2) produces, within certain limits, the same statistical output as the original database. For a transformable databaseDthere are two options: One may physically transformDinto a suitable databaseD', or one may release only that output which will not permit the users to decide whether it comes fromDorD'. The second way is, of course, the easier one. Basic structural requirements for transformable statistical databases are investigated. The closing section discusses advantages, drawbacks, and open questions.
