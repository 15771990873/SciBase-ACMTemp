Histograms and related synopsis structures are popular techniques for approximating data distributions. These have been successful in query optimization and a variety of applications, including approximate querying, similarity searching, and data mining, to name a few. Histograms were a few of the earliest synopsis structures proposed and continue to be used widely. The histogram construction problem is to construct the best histogram restricted to a space bound that reflects the data distribution most accurately under a given error measure.The histograms are used as quick and easy estimates. Thus, a slight loss of accuracy, compared to the optimal histogram under the given error measure, can be offset by fast histogram construction algorithms. A natural question arises in this context: Can we find a fast near optimal approximation algorithm for the histogram construction problem? In this article, we give the first linear time (1&plus;&epsi;)-factor approximation algorithms (for any &epsi; > 0) for a large number of histogram construction problems including the use of piecewise small degree polynomials to approximate data, workloads, etc. Several of our algorithms extend to data streams.Using synthetic and real-life data sets, we demonstrate that in many scenarios the approximate histograms are almost identical to optimal histograms in quality and are significantly faster to construct.
