A partition occurs when functioning sites in a distributed system are unable to communicate. This paper introduces a new method for managing replicated data objects in the presence of partitions. Each operation provided by a replicated object has a set. of quorums, which are sets of sites whose cooperation suffices to execute the operation. The method permits an object's quorums to be adjusted dynamically in response to failures and recoveries. A transaction that is unable to progress using one set of quorums may switch to another, more favorable set, and transactions in different. Partitions may progress using different sets. This method has three novel aspects: (1) it supports a wider range of quorums than earlier proposals, (2) it, scales up effectively to large systems because quorum adjustments do not require global reconfiguration, and (3) it, systematically exploits the semantics of typed objects to support more flexible quorum adjustment.
