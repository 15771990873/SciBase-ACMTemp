The 3-Dimensional Information Space (3DIS) is an extensible object-oriented framework for information management. It is specifically oriented toward supporting the database requirements for data-intensive information system applications in which (1) information objects of various levels of abstraction and modalities must be accommodated, (2) descriptive and structural information (metadata) is rich and dynamic, and (3) users who are not database experts must be able to design, manipulate, and evolve databases. In response to these needs, the 3DIS provides an approach in which data and the descriptive information about data are handled uniformly in an extensible framework. The 3DIS provides a simple, geometric, and formal representation of data which forms a basis for understanding, defining, and manipulating databases. Several prototype implementations based upon the 3DIS have been designed and implemented and are in experimental use.
