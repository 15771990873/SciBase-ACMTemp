In recent years the information processing requirements of business organizations have expanded tremendously. With this expansion, the design of databases to efficiently manage and protect business information has become critical. We analyze the impacts ofrecord segmentation(the assignment of data items to segments defining subfiles), an efficiency-oriented design technique, and ofbackup and recovery strategies, a data protection technique, on the overall process of database design. A combined record segmentation/backup and recovery procedure is presented and an application of the procedure is discussed. Results in which problem characteristics are varied along three dimensions: update frequencies, available types of access paths, and the predominant type of data retrieval that must be supported by the database, are presented.
