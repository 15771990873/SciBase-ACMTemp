A modification of linear hashing is proposed for which the conventional use of overflow records is avoided. Furthermore, an implementation of linear hashing is presented for which the amount of physical storage claimed is only fractionally more than the minimum required. This implementation uses a fixed amount of in-core space. Simulation results are given which indicate that even for storage utilizations approaching 95 percent, the average successful search cost for this method is close to one disk access.
