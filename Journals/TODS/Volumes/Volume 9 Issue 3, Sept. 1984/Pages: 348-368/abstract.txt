The query inference problem is to translate a sentence of a query language into an unambiguous representation of a query. A query is represented as an expression over a set of query trees. A metric is introduced for measuring the complexity of a query and also a proposal that a sentence be translated into the least complex query which “satisfies” the sentence. This method of query inference can be used to resolve ambiguous sentences and leads to easier formulation of sentences.
