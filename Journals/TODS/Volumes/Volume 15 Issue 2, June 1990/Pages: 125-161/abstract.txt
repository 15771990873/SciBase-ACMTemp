The problem of generating reasonable natural language-like responses to queries formulated in nonnavigational query languages with logical data independence is addressed. An extended ER model, the Entity-Relationship-Involvement model, is defined which assists in providing a greater degree of logical data independence and the generation of natural language explanations of a query processor's interpretation of a query. These are accomplished with the addition of the concept of an involvement to the model. Based on involvement definitions in a formally defined data definition language, DDL, an innovative strategy for generating explanations is outlined and exemplified. In the conclusion, possible extensions to the approach are given.
