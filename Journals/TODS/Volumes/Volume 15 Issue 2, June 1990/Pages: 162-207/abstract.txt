The purpose of semantic query optimization is to use semantic knowledge (e.g., integrity constraints) for transforming a query into a form that may be answered more efficiently than the original version. In several previous papers we described and proved the correctness of a method for semantic query optimization in deductive databases couched in first-order logic. This paper consolidates the major results of these papers emphasizing the techniques and their applicability for optimizing relational queries. Additionally, we show how this method subsumes and generalizes earlier work on semantic query optimization. We also indicate how semantic query optimization techniques can be extended to databases that support recursion and integrity constraints that contain disjunction, negation, and recursion.
