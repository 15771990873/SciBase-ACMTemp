This paper suggests that more powerful database systems (DBMS) can be built by supporting database procedures as full-fledged database objects. In particular, allowing fields of a database to be a collection of queries in the query language of the system is shown to allow the natural expression of complex data relationships. Moreover, many of the features present in object-oriented systems and semantic data models can be supported by this facility.In order to implement this construct, extensions to a typical relational query language must be made, and considerable work on the execution engine of the underlying DBMS must be accomplished. This paper reports on the extensions for one particular query language and data manager and then gives performance figures for a prototype implementation. Even though the performance of the prototype is competitive with that of a conventional system, suggestions for improvement are presented.
