In this paper a new method to increase parallelism in database systems is described. Use is made of the fact that for recovery reasons, we often have two values for one object in the databaseâ€”the new one and the old one. Introduced and discussed in detail is a certain scheme by which readers and writers may work simultaneously on the same object. It is proved that transactions executed according to this scheme have the correct effect; i.e., consistency is preserved. Several variations of the basic scheme which are suitable depending on the degree of parallelism required, are described.
