This paper describes the implementation history of the INGRES database system. It focuses on mistakes that were made in progress rather than on eventual corrections. Some attention is also given to the role of structured design in a database system implementation and to the problem of supporting nontrivial users. Lastly, miscellaneous impressions of UNIX, the PDP-11, and data models are given.
