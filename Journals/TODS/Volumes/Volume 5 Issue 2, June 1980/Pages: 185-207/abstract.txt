TAXIS, a language for the design of interactive information systems (e.g., credit card verification, student-course registration, and airline reservations) is described. TAXIS offers (relational) database management facilities, a means of specifying semantic integrity constraints, and an exception-handling mechanism, integrated into a single language through the concepts ofclass, property, and theIS-A(generalization)relationship. A description of the main constructs of TAXIS is included and their usefulness illustrated with examples.
