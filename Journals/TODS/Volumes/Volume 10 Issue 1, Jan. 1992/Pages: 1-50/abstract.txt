We present a framework for the development of information systems based on the premise that the knowledge that influences the development process needs to somehow be captured, represented, and managed if the development process is to be rationalized. Experiences with a prototype environment developed in ESPRIT project DAIDA demonstrate the approach. The project has implemented an environment based on state-of-the-art languages for requirements modeling, design and implementation of information systems. In addition, the environment offers tools for aiding the mapping process from requirements to design and then to implementation, also for representing decisions reached during the development process. The development process itself is represented explicitly within the system, thus making the DAIDA development framework easier to comprehend, use, and modify.
