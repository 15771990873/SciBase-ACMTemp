An associative processor called RAP has been designed to provide hardware support for the use and manipulation of databases. RAP is particularly suited for supporting relational databases. In this paper, the relational operations provided by the RAP hardware are described, and a representative approach to providing the same relational operations with conventional software and hardware is devised. Analytic models are constructed for RAP and the conventional system. The execution times of several of the operations are shown to be vastly improved with RAP for large relations.
