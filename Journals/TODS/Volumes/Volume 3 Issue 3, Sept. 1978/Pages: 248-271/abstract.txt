The problem of process synchronization in database systems is analyzed in a strictly systematic way, on a rather abstract level; the abstraction is chosen such that the essential characteristics of the problem can be distinctly modeled and investigated. Using a small set of concepts, a consistent description of the whole problem is developed; many widely used, but only vaguely defined, notions are defined exactly within this framework. The abstract treatment of the problem immediately leads to practically useful insights with respect to possible solutions, although implementational aspects are not discussed in detail.
