Comparison of three multiprocessor computer architectures for database support is made possible through evaluation of response time expressions. These expressions are derived by parameterizing algorithms performed by each machine to execute a relational algebra query. Parameters represent properties of the database and components of the machines. Studies of particular parameter values exhibit response times for conventional machine technology, for low selectivity, high duplicate occurrence, and parallel disk access, increasing the number of processors, and improving communication and processing technology.
