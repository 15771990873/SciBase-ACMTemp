Traditional file structures that provide multikey access to records, for example, inverted files, are extensions of file structures originally designed for single-key access. They manifest various deficiencies in particular for multikey access to highly dynamic files. We study the dynamic aspects of file structures that treat all keys symmetrically, that is, file structures which avoid the distinction between primary and secondary keys. We start from a bitmap approach and treat the problem of file design as one of data compression of a large sparse matrix. This leads to the notions of agrid partitionof the search space and of agrid directory, which are the keys to a dynamic file structure called thegrid file. This file system adapts gracefully to its contents under insertions and deletions, and thus achieves an upper bound of two disk accesses for single record retrieval; it also handles range queries and partially specified queries efficiently. We discuss in detail the design decisions that led to the grid file, present simulation results of its behavior, and compare it to other multikey access file structures.
