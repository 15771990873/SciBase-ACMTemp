The hot-set model, characterizing the buffer requirements of relational queries, is presented. This model allows the system to determine the optimal buffer space to be allocated to a query; it can also be used by the query optimizer to derive efficient execution plans accounting for the available buffer space, and by a query scheduler to prevent thrashing. The hot-set model is compared with the working-set model. A simulation study is presented.
