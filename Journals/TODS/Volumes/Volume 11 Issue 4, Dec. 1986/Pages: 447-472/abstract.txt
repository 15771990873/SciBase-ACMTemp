In this paper we describe a system which, given a query in SQL-like relational database language, will display its meaning in clear, unambiguous natural language. The syntax-driven translation mechanism is independent of the application domain. It has direct applications in designing computer-based SQL tutorial systems and program debugging systems. The research results obtained in the paper will also be useful in query optimization and design of a more user-friendly language front-end
for casual users.
