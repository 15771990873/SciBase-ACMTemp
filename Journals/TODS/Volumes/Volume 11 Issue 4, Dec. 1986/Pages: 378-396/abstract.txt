This paper deals with the transaction management aspects of the R* distributed database system. It concentrates primarily on the description of the R*commit protocols, Presumed Abort (PA) and Presumed Commit (PC). PA and PC are extensions of the well-known, two-phase (2P) commit protocol. PA is optimized for read-only transactions and a class of multisite update transactions, and PC is optimized for other classes of multisite update transactions. The optimizations result in reduced intersite message traffic and log writes, and, consequently, a better response time. The paper also discusses R*'s approach toward distributed deadlock detection and resolution.
