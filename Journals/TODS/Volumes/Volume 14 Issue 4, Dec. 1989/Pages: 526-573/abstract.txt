Summary-Table-by-Example (STBE) is a graphical language suitable for statistical database applications. STBE queries have a hierarchical subquery structure and manipulate summary tables and relations with set-valued attributes.The hierarchical arrangement of STBE queries naturally implies a tuple-by-tuple subquery evaluation strategy (similar to the nested loops join implementation technique) which may not be the best query processing strategy. In this paper we discuss the query processing techniques used in STBE. We first convert an STBE query into an “extended” relational algebra (ERA) expression. Two transformations are introduced to remove the hierarchical arrangement of subqueries so that query optimization is possible. To solve the “empty partition” problem of aggregate function evaluation, directional join (one-sided outer-join) is utilized. We give the algebraic properties of the ERA operators to obtain an “improved” ERA expression. Finally we briefly discuss the generation of alternative implementations of a given ERA expression.STBE is implemented in a prototype statistical database management system. We discuss the STBE-related features of the implemented system.
