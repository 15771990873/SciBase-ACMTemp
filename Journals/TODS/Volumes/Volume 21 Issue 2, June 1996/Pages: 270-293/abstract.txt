Satisfiability, implication, and equivalence problems involving conjunctive inequalities are important and widely encountered database problems that need to be efficiently and effectively processed. In this article we consider two popular types of arithmetic inequalities, (XopY) and (XopC), whereXandYare attributes,Cis a constant of the domain orX, andop∈{<, ≤, =,≠, >, ≥). These inequalities are most frequently used in a database system, inasmuch as the former type of inequality represents a 0-join, and the  latter is  a selection. We study the satisfiability and implication problems under the integer  domain and the   real domain, as well as under two different operator sets ({<, ≤, =, ≥, >} and {<, ≤, =,≠, ≥, >}). Our results show that solutions under different domains and/or different operator sets are quite different. Out of these eight cases, excluding two cases that had been shown to be NP-hard, we either report the first necessary and sufficient conditions for these problems as well as their efficient algorithms with complexity analysis (for four cases), or provide an improved algorithm (for two cases). These iff conditions and algorithms are essential to database designers, practitioners, and researchers. These  algorithms  have been implemented and an experimental study comparing the proposed algorithms and those previously known is conducted. Our  experiments show that the proposed algorithms are more efficient than previously known algorithms even for small input. The C++ code can be obtained by an anonymous ftp from <archive.fiu.edu>.
