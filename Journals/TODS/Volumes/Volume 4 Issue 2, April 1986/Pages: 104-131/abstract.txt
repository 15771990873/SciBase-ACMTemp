Asocietymodel, which characterizes the behavior and procedure of offices, is proposed. It is our belief that an office system capable of dealing with all real office problems only through the modeling of the internal behavior of an office can be developed. In this society model, office entities are viewed asagents. An agent is modeled as amicrosocietyof interacting knowledge sources. Within the microsociety, there exists amicroknowledge exchange system, which provides a set of microknowledge exchange protocols as a coordination system among those knowledge sources during their cooperative reasoning process. An office is then modeled as a society of various interacting agents using their knowledge to complete the office goals cooperatively. It is this unified view that allows offices to be modeled in a flexible and general way.
