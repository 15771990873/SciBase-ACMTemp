In a temporal database, time values are associated with data item to indicate their periods of validity. We propose a model for temporal databases within the framework of the classical database theory. Our model is realized as a temporal parameterization of static relations. We do not impose any restrictions upon the schemes of temporal relations. The classical concepts of normal forms and dependencies are easily extended to our model, allowing a suitable design for a database scheme. We present a relational algebra and a tuple calculus for our model and prove their equivalence. Our data model is homogeneous in the sense that the periods of validity of all the attributes in a given tuple of a temporal relation are identical. We discuss how to relax the homogeneity requirement to extend the application domain of our approach.
