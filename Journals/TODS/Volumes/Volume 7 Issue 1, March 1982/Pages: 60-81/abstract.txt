A model for studying the combined problems of file design and file reorganization is presented. New modeling techniques for predicting the performance evolution of files and for finding optimal reorganization points for files are introduced. Applications of the model to hash-based and indexed-sequential files reveal important relationships between initial loading factors and reorganization frequency. A practical file design strategy, based on these relationships, is proposed.
