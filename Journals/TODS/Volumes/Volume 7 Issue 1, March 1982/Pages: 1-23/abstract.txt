A “decompilation” algorithm is developed to transform a program written with the procedural operations of CODASYL DML into one which interacts with a relational system via a nonprocedural query specification. An Access Path Model is introduced to interpret the semantic accesses performed by the program. Data flow analysis is used to determine how FIND operations implement semantic accesses. A sequence of these is mapped into a relational query and embedded into the original program. The class of programs for which the algorithm succeeds is characterized.
