Considered here, for a particular model of databases in which only information about relatively large sets of records can be obtained, is the question of whether one can from statistical information obtain information about individuals. Under the assumption that the data in the database is taken from arbitrary integers, it is shown that essentially nothing can be inferred. It is also shown that when the values are known to be imprecise in some fixed range, one can often deduce the values of individual records.
