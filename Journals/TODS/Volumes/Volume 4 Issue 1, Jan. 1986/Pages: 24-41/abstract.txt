The “Whiteboards” system is intended to be an electronic equivalent of the whiteboards and corkboards that we have in our offices. A Whiteboard database has similar qualities of storing disparate collections of data and saving their spatial location in a window to help with organization. A Whiteboard database can contain references to arbitrary entities: text files, notes, programs, tools, pictures, etc. Whiteboards runs as an application in the Cedar programming environment developed at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center.
