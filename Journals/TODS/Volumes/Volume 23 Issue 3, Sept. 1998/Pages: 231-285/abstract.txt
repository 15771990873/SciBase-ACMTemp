Access control models, such as the ones supported by commercial DBMSs,  are not yet able to fully meet many application needs. An important requirement derives from the temporal dimension that permissions have in many real-world situations. Permissions are often limited in time or may hold only for specific periods of time. In this article, we present an access control model in which periodic temporal intervals are associated with authorizations. An authorization is automatically granted in the specified intervals and revoked when such intervals expire. Deductive temporal rules with periodicity and order constraints are provided to derive new authorizations based on the presence or absence of other authorizations in specific periods of time. We provide a solution to the problem of  ensuring the uniqueness of the global set of valid authorizations derivable at each instant, and we propose an algorithm to compute this set. Moreover, we address issues related to the efficiency of access control by adopting a materialization approach. The resulting model provides a high degree of flexibility and supports the specification of several protection requirements that cannot be expressed in traditional access control models.
