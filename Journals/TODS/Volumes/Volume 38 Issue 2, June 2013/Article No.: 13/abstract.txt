In “Forward Node-Selecting Queries over Trees,” Olteanu [2007] gives three rewriting systems for eliminating reverse XPath axis steps from node-selecting queries over trees, together with arguments for their correctness and termination for a large class of input graphs, including cyclic ones. These proofs are valid for tree or acyclic formulas, but two of the rewrite systems (TRS2andTRS3) do not terminate on cyclic graphs; that is, there are infinite rewrite sequences that never yield a normal form. We investigate the reasons why the termination arguments do not work for general cyclic formulas, and develop alternative algorithms that can be used instead. We prove thatTRS2is weakly normalizing, whileTRS3is not weakly normalizing, but it can be extended to a weakly normalizing systemTRS3&cir;. The algorithms and proof techniques illustrate unforeseen subtleties in the handling of cyclic queries.
