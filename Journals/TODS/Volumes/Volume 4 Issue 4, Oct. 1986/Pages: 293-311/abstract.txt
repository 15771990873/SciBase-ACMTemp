Naming and addressing are areas in which there is still a need for clarification. Many definitions for names, addresses, and routes have been proposed, but the exact relations among these concepts are obscure. A taxonomy of names, addresses, and routes is presented. First, we identify names and routes as the essential concepts of communication. Then, addresses are introduced as an intermediate form that eases the process of mapping between names and routes; an original definition of an address is thus proposed. Relations among names, addresses, and routes are explained with the concept of mapping. On this basis, a general model relating names, addresses, and routes is built and then applied recursively throughout a layered architecture, leading to a layered naming and addressing model which may play the same role for naming and addressing features that the OS1 reference model plays for the definition of services and protocols. Finally, the model is particularized to a typical network architecture. The model may also be applied to non-OSI layered systems; naming, addressing, and routing issues in any network architecture could be a particular instance of this layered model.
