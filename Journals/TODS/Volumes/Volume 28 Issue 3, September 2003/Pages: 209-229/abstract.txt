The Flexible Authorization Framework (FAF) defined by Jajodia et al. [2001] provides a policy-neutral framework for specifying access control policies that is expressive enough to specify many known access control policies. Although the original formulation of FAF indicated how rules could be added to or deleted from a FAF specification, it did not address the removal of access permissions from users. We present two options for removing permissions in FAF and provide details on the option which is representation independent.
