The universal relation model aims at achieving complete access-path independence in relational databases by relieving the user of the need for logical navigation among relations. We clarify the assumptions underlying it and explore the approaches suggested for implementing it.The essential idea of the universal relation model is that access paths are embedded in attribute names. Thus attribute names must play unique “roles.” Furthermore, it assumes that for every set of attributes there is a basic relationship that the user has in mind. The user's queries refer to these basic relationships rather than to the underlying database.Two fundamentally different approaches to the universal relation model have been taken. According to the first approach, the user's view of the database is a universal relation or many universal relations, about which the user poses queries. The second approach sees the model as having query-processing capabilities that relieve the user of the need to specify the logical access path. Thus, while the first approach gives a denotational semantics to query answering, the second approach gives it an operational semantics. We investigate the relationship between these two approaches.
