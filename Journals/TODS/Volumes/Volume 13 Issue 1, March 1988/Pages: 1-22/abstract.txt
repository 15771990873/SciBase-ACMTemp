User views in a relational database obtained through a single projection ("projection views") are considered in a new framework. Specifically, such views, where each tuple in the view represents an object ("object-projection views"), are studied using the dynamic relational model, which captures the evolution of the database through consecutive updates. Attribute sets that yield object-projection views are characterized using the static and dynamic functional dependencies satisfied by the database. Object-projection views are then described using the static and dynamic functional dependencies “inherited” from the original database. Finally, the impact of dynamic constraints on the view update problem is studied in a limited context. This paper demonstrates that new, useful information about views can be obtained by looking at the evolution of the database as captured by the dynamic relational model.
