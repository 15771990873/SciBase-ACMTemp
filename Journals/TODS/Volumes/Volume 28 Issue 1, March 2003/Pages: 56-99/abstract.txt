A set containment join is a join between set-valued attributes of two relations, whose join condition is specified using the subset (âŠ†) operator. Set containment joins are deployed in many database applications, even those that do not support set-valued attributes. In this article, we propose two novel partitioning algorithms, called the Adaptive Pick-and-Sweep Join (APSJ) and the Adaptive Divide-and-Conquer Join (ADCJ), which allow computing set containment joins efficiently. We show that APSJ outperforms previously suggested algorithms for many data sets, often by an order of magnitude. We present a detailed analysis of the algorithms and study their performance on real and synthetic data using an implemented testbed.
