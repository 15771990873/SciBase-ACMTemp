Due to the evolution of Geographical Information Systems, large collections of spatial data having various thematic contents are currently available. As a result, the interest of users is not limited to simple spatial selections and joins, but complex query types that implicate numerous spatial inputs become more common. Although several algorithms have been proposed for computing the result of pairwise spatial joins, limited work exists on processing and optimization ofmultiway spatial joins. In this article, we review pairwise spatial join algorithms and show how they can be combined for multiple inputs. In addition, we explore the application ofsynchronous traversal(ST), a methodology that processes synchronously all inputs without producing intermediate results. Then, we integrate the two approaches in an engine that includes ST and pairwise algorithms, using dynamic programming to determine the optimal execution plan. The results show that, in most cases, multiway spatial joins are best processed by combining ST with pairwise methods. Finally, we study the optimization of very large queries by employing randomized search algorithms.
