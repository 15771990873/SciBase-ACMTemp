In this article, we address the problem of how to extend the definition of functional dependencies (FDs) in incomplete relations to XML documents (called XFDs) using the well-known strong satisfaction approach.We propose a syntactic definition of strong XFD satisfaction in an XML document and then justify it by showing that, similar to the case in relational databases, for the case of simple paths, keys in XML are a special case of XFDs. We also propose a normal form for XML documents based on our definition of XFDs and provide a formal justification for it by proving that it is a necessary and sufficient condition for the elimination of redundancy in an XML document.
