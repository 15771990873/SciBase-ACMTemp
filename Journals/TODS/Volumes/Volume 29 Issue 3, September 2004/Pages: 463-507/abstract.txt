This article addresses the problem of managing Moving Objects Databases (MODs) which capture the inherent imprecision of the information about the moving object's location at a given time. We deal systematically with the issues of constructing and representing thetrajectoriesof moving objects and querying the MOD. We propose to model an uncertain trajectory as a three-dimensional (3D) cylindrical body and we introduce a set of novel but natural spatio-temporaloperatorswhich capture theuncertaintyand are used to express spatio-temporal range queries. We devise and analyze algorithms for processing the operators and demonstrate that the model incorporates the uncertainty in a manner which enables efficient querying, thus striking a balance between the modeling power and computational efficiency. We address some implementation aspects which we experienced in our DOMINO project, as a part of which the operators that we introduce have been implemented. We also report on some experimental observations of a practical relevance.
