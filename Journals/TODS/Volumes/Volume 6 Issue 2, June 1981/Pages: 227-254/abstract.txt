In this paper four alternative strategies for assigning processors to queries in multiprocessor database machines are described and evaluated. The results demonstrate that SIMD database machines are indeed a poor design when their performance is compared with that of the three MIMD strategies presented.Also introduced is the application of data-flow machine techniques to the processing of relational algebra queries. A strategy that employs data-flow techniques is shown to be superior to the other strategies described by several experiments. Furthermore, if the data-flow query processing strategy is employed, the results indicate that a two-level storage hierarchy (in which relations are paged between a shared data cache and mass storage) does not have a significant impact on performance.
