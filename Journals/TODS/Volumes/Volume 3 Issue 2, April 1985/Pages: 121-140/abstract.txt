The Linguistic String Project (LSP) natural language processing system has been developed as a domain-independent natural language processing system. Initially utilized for processing sets of medical messages and other texts in the medical domain, it has been used at the Naval Research Laboratory for processing Navy messages about shipboard equipment failures. This paper describes the structure of the LSP system and the features that make it transportable from one domain to another. The processing procedures encourage the isolation of domain-specific information, yet take advantage of the syntactic and semantic similarities between the medical and Navy domains. From our experience in transporting the LSP system, we identify the features that are required for transportable natural language systems.
