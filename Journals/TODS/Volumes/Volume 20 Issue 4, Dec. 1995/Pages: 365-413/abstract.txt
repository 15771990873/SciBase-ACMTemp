A novel execution model for rule application in active databases is developed and applied to the problem of updating derived data in a database represented using a semantic, object-based database model. The execution model is based on the use of “limited ambiguity rules” (LARs), which permit disjunction in rule actions. The execution model essentially performs a breadth-first exploration of alternative extensions of a user-requested update. Given an object-based database schema, both integrity constraints and specifications of derived classes and attributes are compiled into a family of limited ambiguity rules. A theoretical analysis shows that the approach is sound: the execution model returns all valid “completions” of a user-requested update, or terminates 
 with an appropriate error notification. The complexity of the approach in connection with derived data update is considered.
