Textual databases with highly variable structure can be usefully described by a grammar-defined model. One example of such a text is theOxford English Dictionary. This paper describes a first attempt to apply technology based on this model to a real problem. A language called GOEDEL, which is a partial implementation of a set of grammar-defined database operators, was used to extract and alter a subset of the OED in order to assist the editors in their production ofThe Shorter Oxford English Dictionary. The implementation of the pstring data structure to describe a piece of text and the functions that operate on this pstring are illustrated with some detailed examples. The project was judged a success and the resulting program used in production by the Oxford University Press.
