The gradual performance deterioration caused by deletions from and insertions into an index-sequential file after loading is analyzed. The model developed assumes that overflow records are handled by chaining. Formulas for computing the expected number of overflow records and the expected number of additional accesses caused by the overflow records for both successful and unsuccessful searches are derived.
