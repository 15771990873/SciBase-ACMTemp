The emergence of a database technology in recent years has focused interest on the subject of data models. A data model is the class of logical data structures which a computer system or language makes available to the user for the purpose of formulating data processing applications. The diversity of computer systems and languages has resulted in a corresponding diversity of data models, and has created a problem for the user in selecting a data model which is in some sense appropriate to a given application. An evaluation procedure is needed which will allow the user to evaluate alternative models in the context of a specific set of applications. This paper takes a first step toward such a procedure by identifying the attributes of a data model which can be used as criteria for evaluating the model. Two kinds of criteria are presented: use criteria, which measure the usability of the model; and implementation criteria, which measure the implementability of the model and the efficiency of the resulting implementation. The use of the criteria is illustrated by applying them to three specific models: ann-ary relational model, a hierarchic model, and a network model.
