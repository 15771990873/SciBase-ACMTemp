File designs suitable for retrieval from a file ofk-field records when queries may be partially specified are examined. Storage redundancy is introduced to obtain improved worst-case and average-case performances. The resulting storage schemes are appropriate for replicated distributed database environments; it is possible to improve the overall average and worst-case behavior for query response as well as provide an environment with very high reliability. Within practical systems it will be possible to improve the query response time performance as well as reliability over comparable systems without replication.
