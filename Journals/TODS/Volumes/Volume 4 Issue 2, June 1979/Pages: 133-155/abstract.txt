A model of database storage and access is presented. The model represents many evaluation algorithms as special cases, and helps to break a complex algorithm into simple access operations. Generalized access cost equations associated with the model are developed and analyzed. Optimization of these cost equations yields an optimal access algorithm which can be synthesized by a query subsystem whose design is based on the modular access operations.
