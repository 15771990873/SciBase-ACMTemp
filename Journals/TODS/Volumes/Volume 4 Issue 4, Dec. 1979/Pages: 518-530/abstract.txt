A new balanced file-organization scheme of order two for multiple-valued records is presented. This scheme is called HUBMFS2(Hiroshima University Balanced Multiple-valued File-organization Scheme of order two). It is assumed that records are characterized bymattributes havingnpossible values each, and the query set consists of queries which specify values of two attributes. It is shown that the redundancy of the bucket (the probability of storing a record in the bucket) is minimized if and only if the structure of the bucket is a partite-claw. A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an HUBMFS2, which is composed exclusively of partite-claw buckets, is given. A construction algorithm is also given. The proposed HUBMFS2is superior to existing BMFS2(Balanced Multiple-valued File-organization Schemes of order two) in that it has the least redundancy among all possible BMFS2's having the same parameters and that it can be constructed for a less restrictive set of parameters.
