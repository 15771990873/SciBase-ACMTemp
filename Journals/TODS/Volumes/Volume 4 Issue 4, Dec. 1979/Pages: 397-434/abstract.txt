During the last three or four years several investigators have been exploring “semantic models” for formatted databases. The intent is to capture (in a more or less formal way) more of the meaning of the data so that database design can become more systematic and the database system itself can behave more intelligently. Two major thrusts are clear.(1) the search for meaningful units that are as small as possible—atomic semantics;(2) the search for meaningful units that are larger than the usualn-ary relation—molecular semantics.In this paper we propose extensions to the relational model to support certain atomic and molecular semantics. These extensions represent a synthesis of many ideas from the published work in semantic modeling plus the introduction of new rules for insertion, update, and deletion, as well as new algebraic operators.
