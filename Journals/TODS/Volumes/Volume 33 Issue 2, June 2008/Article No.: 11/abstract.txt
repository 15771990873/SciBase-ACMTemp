Schema mappings are high-level specifications that describe the relationship between two database schemas. Two operators on schema mappings, namely the composition operator and the inverse operator, are regarded as especially important. Progress on the study of the inverse operator was not made until very recently, as even finding the exact semantics of this operator turned out to be a fairly delicate task. Furthermore, this notion is rather restrictive, since it is rare that a schema mapping possesses an inverse.In this article, we introduce and study the notion of a quasi-inverse of a schema mapping. This notion is a principled relaxation of the notion of an inverse of a schema mapping; intuitively, it is obtained from the notion of an inverse by not differentiating between instances that are equivalent for data-exchange purposes. For schema mappings specified by source-to-target tuple-generating dependencies (s-t tgds), we give a necessary and sufficient combinatorial condition for the existence of a quasi-inverse, and then use this condition to obtain both positive and negative results about the existence of quasi-inverses. In particular, we show that every LAV (local-as-view) schema mapping has a quasi-inverse, but that there are schema mappings specified by full s-t tgds that have no quasi-inverse. After this, we study the language needed to express quasi-inverses of schema mappings specified by s-t tgds, and we obtain a complete characterization. We also characterize the language needed to express inverses of schema mappings, and thereby solve a problem left open in the earlier study of the inverse operator. Finally, we show that quasi-inverses can be used in many cases to recover the data that was exported by the original schema mapping when performing data exchange.
