To discover translation knowledge in diverse data resources on the Web, this article proposes an effective approach to finding translation equivalents of query terms and constructing multilingual lexicons through the mining of Web anchor texts and link structures. Although Web anchor texts are wide-scoped hypertext resources, not every particular pair of languages contains sufficient anchor texts for effective extraction of translations for Web queries. For more generalized applications, the approach is designed based on a transitive translation model. The translation equivalents of a query term can be extracted via its translation in an intermediate language. To reduce interference from translation errors, the approach further integrates a competitive linking algorithm into the process of determining the most probable translation. A series of experiments has been conducted, including performance tests on term translation extraction, cross-language information retrieval, and translation suggestions for practical Web search services, respectively. The obtained experimental results have shown that the proposed approach is effective in extracting translations of unknown queries, is easy to combine with the probabilistic retrieval model to improve the cross-language retrieval performance, and is very useful when the considered language pairs lack a sufficient number of anchor texts. Based on the approach, an experimental system called LiveTrans has been developed for English--Chinese cross-language Web search.
