Unidraw is a framework for creating graphical editors in domains such as technical and artistic drawing, music composition, and circuit design. The Unidraw architecture simplifies the construction of these editors by proving programming abstractions that are common across domains. Unidraw defines four basic abstractions:componentsdefine operations on components, andexternal representationsdefine the mapping between components and the file format generated by the editor. Unidraw also supports multiple views, graphical connectivity, and dataflow between components. This paper describes the Unidraw design, implementation issues, and three experimental domain specific editors we have developed with Unidraw: a drawing editor, a user interface builder,  and a schematic capture system. Our results indicate a substantial reduction in implementation time and effort compared with existing tools.
