The declining cost of computer hardware and the increasing data processing needs of geographically dispersed organizations have led to substantial interest in distributed data management. SDD-1 is a distributed database management system currently being developed by Computer Corporation of America. Users interact with SDD-1 precisely as if it were a nondistributed database system because SDD-1 handles all issues arising from the distribution of data. These issues include distributed concurrency control, distributed query processing, resiliency to component failure, and distributed directory management. This paper presents an overview of the SDD-1 design and its solutions to the above problems.This paper is the first of a series of companion papers on SDD-1 (Bernstein and Shipman [2], Bernstein et al. [4], and Hammer and Shipman [14]).
