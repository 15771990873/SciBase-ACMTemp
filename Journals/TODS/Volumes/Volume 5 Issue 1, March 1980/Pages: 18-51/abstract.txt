This paper presents the concurrency control strategy of SDD-1. SDD-1, a System for Distributed Databases, is a prototype distributed database system being developed by Computer Corporation of America. In SDD-1, portions of data distributed throughout a network may be replicated at multiple sites. The SDD-1 concurrency control guarantees database consistency in the face of such distribution and replication.This paper is one of a series of companion papers on SDD-1 [4, 10, 12, 21].
