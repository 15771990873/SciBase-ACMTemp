The advent of geolocation technologies has generated unprecedented rich datasets of people’s location information at a very high fidelity. These location datasets can be used to study human behavior; for example, social studies have shown that people who are seen together frequently at the same place and same time are most probably socially related. In this article, we are interested in inferring these social connections by analyzing people’s location information; this is useful in a variety of application domains, from sales and marketing to intelligence analysis. In particular, we propose an entropy-based model (EBM) that not only infers social connections but also estimates the strength of social connections by analyzing people’s co-occurrences in space and time. We examine two independent methods:diversityandweighted frequency, through which co-occurrences contribute to the strength of a social connection. In addition, we take the characteristics of each location into consideration in order to compensate for cases where only limited location information is available. We also study the role of location semantics in improving our computation of social strength. We develop a parallel implementation of our algorithm using MapReduce to create a scalable and efficient solution for online applications. We conducted extensive sets of experiments with real-world datasets including both people’s location data and their social connections, where we used the latter as the ground truth to verify the results of applying our approach to the former. We show that our approach is valid across different networks and outperforms the competitors.
