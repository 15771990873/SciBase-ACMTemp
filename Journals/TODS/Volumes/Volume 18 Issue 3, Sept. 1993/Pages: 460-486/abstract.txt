The semantics of objects and transactions in database systems are investigated. User-defined predicates calledconsistency assertionsare used to specify user programs. Three new correctness criteria are proposed. The first correctness criterionconsistencyis based solely on the users' specifications and admit nonserializable executions that are acceptable to the users. Integrity constraints of the database are maintained through consistency assertions. The second correctness criterionorderabilityis a generalization of view serializability and represents a weak notion of equivalence to a serial schedule. Finally, the third correctness criterionstrong order-abilityis introduced as a generalization of conflict serializability. Unlike consistency, the notions of orderability allow users to operate an isolation as maintenance of the integrity constrainst now becomes the responsibility of the database system.
