Suppose a database schemaDis extended toD¯by adding new relation schemas, and states forDare extended to states forD¯by applying joins and projections to existing relations. It is shown that certain desirable properties thatD¯has with respect toD. These properties amount to the ability to compute efficiently the join of all relations in a state forDfrom an extension of this state overD¯. The equivalence is proved for unrestricted (i.e., both finite and infinite) databases. IfD¯is obtained fromDby adding a set of new relation schemas that form a tree schema, then the equivalence also holds for finite databases. In this case there is also a polynomial time algorithm for testing the existence of a tree projection ofD¯with respect toD.
