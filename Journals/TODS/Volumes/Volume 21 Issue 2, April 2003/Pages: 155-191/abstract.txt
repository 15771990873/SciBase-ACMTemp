Content-based video database access control is becoming very important, but it depends on the progresses of the following related research issues: (a) efficient video analysis for supporting semantic visual concept representation; (b) effective video database indexing structure; (c) the development of suitable video database models; and (d) the development of access control models tailored to the characteristics of video data. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to support multilevel access control in video databases. Our access control technique combines a video database indexing mechanism with a hierarchical organization of visual concepts (i.e., video database indexing units), so that different classes of users can access different video elements or even the same video element with different quality levels according to their permissions. These video elements, which, in our access control mechanism, are used for specifying the authorization objects, can be a semantic cluster, a subcluster, a video scene, a video shot, a video frame, or even a salient object (i.e., region of interest). In the paper, we first introduce our techniques for obtaining these multilevel video access units. We also propose a hierarchical video database indexing technique to support our multilevel video access control mechanism. Then, we present an innovative access control model which is able to support flexible multilevel access control to video elements. Moreover, the application of our multilevel video database modeling, representation, and indexing for MPEG-7 is discussed.
