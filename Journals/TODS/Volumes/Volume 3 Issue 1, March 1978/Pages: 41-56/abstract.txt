The importance of the estimation of the number of desired records for a given query is outlined. Two algorithms for the estimation in the “closest neighbors problem” are presented. The numbers of operations of the algorithms are&Ogr;(ml2) and&Ogr;(ml), wheremis the number of clusters andlis the “length” of the query.
