We present the file search problem in a decision-theoretic framework, and discuss a variation of it that we call the common index problem. The goal of the common index problem is to return the best available record in the file, wherebestis in terms of a class of user preferences. We use dynamic programming to construct an optimal algorithm using two different optimality criteria, and we develop sufficient conditions for obtaining complete information.
