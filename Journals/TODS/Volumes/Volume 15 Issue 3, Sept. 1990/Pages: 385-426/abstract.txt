We extend the query optimization techniques known as algebric manipulations with relational expressions [48] to work with deductive databases. In particular, we propose a method for moving data-independent selections and projections into recursive axioms, which extends all other known techniques for performing that task [2, 3, 9, 18, 20]. We also show that, in a well-defined sense, our algorithm is optimal among the algorithms that propagate data-independent selections through recursion.
