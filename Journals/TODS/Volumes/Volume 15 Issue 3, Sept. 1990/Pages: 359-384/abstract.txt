Currently, a variety of information retrieval systems are available
to potential users.… While in many cases these systems are
accessed from personal computers, typically no advantage is taken of the
computing resources of those machines (such as local processing and
storage). In this paper we explore the possibility of using the user's
local storage capabilities to cache data at the user's site. This would
improve the response time of user queries albeit at the cost of
incurring the overhead required in maintaining multiple copies. In order
to reduce this overhead it may be appropriate to allow copies to diverge
in a controlled fashion.… Thus, we introduce the notion ofquasi-copies, which embodies the
ideas sketched above. We also define the types of deviations that seem
useful, and discuss the available implementation strategies.—From the Authors' Abstract
