We present an efficient implementation method for temporal integrity constraints formulated in Past Temporal Logic. Although the constraints can refer to past states of the database, their checking does not require that the entire database history be stored. Instead, every database state is extended with auxiliary relations that contain the historical information necessary for checking constraints. Auxiliary relations can be implemented as materialized relational views.
