Themaintenance problemof a database scheme is the following decision problem: Given a consistent database state &rgr; and a new tupleuover some relation scheme of &rgr;, is the modified state &rgr;âˆª{u} still consistent? A database scheme is said to beconstant-time-maintainable(ctm)if there exists an algorithm that solves its maintenance problem by making a fixed number of tuple retrievals. We present a practically useful algorithm, called thecanonical maintenance algorithm, that solves the maintenance problem of all ctm database schemes within a "not too large" bound. A number of interesting properties are shown for  ctm database schemes, among them that   non-ctm database schemes are not maintainable in less than a linear time in the state size. A test method is given when only cover embedded functional dependencies (fds) appear. When the given dependencies consist of fds and the join dependency (jd)&bowtie;Rof the database scheme, testing whether a database scheme is ctm is reduced to the case of cover embedded fds. When dependency-preserving database schemes with only equality-generating dependencies (egds) are considered, it is shown that every ctm database scheme has a set of dependencies that is equivalent to a set of embedded fds, and thus, our test method for the case of embedded fds can be applied. In particular, this includes the  important case of lossless database schemes with only egds.
