Primary key violations provide a natural means for modeling uncertainty in the relational data model. A repair (or possible world) of a database is then obtained by selecting a maximal number of tuples without ever selecting two distinct tuples that have the same primary key value. For a Boolean queryq, the problem CERTAINTY(q) takes as input a databasedband asks whetherqevaluates to true on every repair ofdb. We are interested in determining queriesqfor which CERTAINTY(q) is first-order expressible (and hence in the low complexity classACÂ°). For queriesqin the class of conjunctive queries without self-join, we provide a necessary syntactic condition for first-order expressibility of CERTAINTY(q). For acyclic queries (in the sense of Beeri et al. &lsqb;1983&rsqb;), this necessary condition is also a sufficient condition. So we obtain a decision procedure for first-order expressibility of CERTAINTY(q) whenqis acyclic and without self-join. We also show that if CERTAINTY(q) is first-order expressible, its first-order definition, commonly called certain first-order rewriting, can be constructed in a rather straightforward way.
