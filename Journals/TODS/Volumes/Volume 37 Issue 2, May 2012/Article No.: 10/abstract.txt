We address the problem of comparing the expressiveness of workflow specification formalisms using a notion ofviewof a workflow. Views allow to compare widely different workflow systems by mapping them to a common representation capturing the observables relevant to the comparison. Using this framework, we compare the expressiveness of several workflow specification mechanisms, including automata, temporal constraints, and pre-and postconditions, with XML and relational databases as underlying data models. One surprising result shows the considerable power of static constraints to simulate apparently much richer workflow control mechanisms.
