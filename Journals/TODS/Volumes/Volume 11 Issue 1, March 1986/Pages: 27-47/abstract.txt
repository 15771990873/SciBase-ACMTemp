In this paper we study when and how B Byzantine agreement protocol can he used in general-purpose database management systems. We present an overview of the failure model used for Byzantine agreement, and of the protocol itself. We then present correctness criteria for database processing in this failure environment and discuss strategies for satisfying them. In doing this, we present new failure models for input/output nodes and study ways to distribute input transactions to processing nodes under these models. Finally, we investigate applications of Byzantine agreement protocols in the more common failure environment where processors are assumed to halt after a failure.
