Monitoring data streams in a distributed system is the focus of much research in recent years. Most of the proposed schemes, however, deal with monitoring simple aggregated values, such as the frequency of appearance of items in the streams. More involved challenges, such as the important task of feature selection (e.g., by monitoring the information gain of various features), still require very high communication overhead using naive, centralized algorithms.We present a novel geometric approach which reduces monitoring the value of a function (vis-Ã -vis a threshold) to a set of constraints applied locally on each of the streams. The constraints are used to locally filter out data increments that do not affect the monitoring outcome, thus avoiding unnecessary communication. As a result, our approach enables monitoring of arbitrary threshold functions over distributed data streams in an efficient manner.We present experimental results on real-world data which demonstrate that our algorithms are highly scalable, and considerably reduce communication load in comparison to centralized algorithms.
