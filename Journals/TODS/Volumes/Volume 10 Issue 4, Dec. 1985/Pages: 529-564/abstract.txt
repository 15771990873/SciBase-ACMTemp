In spite of the wide variety of concurrency control and recovery mechanisms proposed during the past decade, the behavior and the performance of various concurrency control and recovery mechanisms remain largely not well understood. In addition, although concurrency control and recovery mechanisms are intimately related, the interaction between them has not been adequately explored. In this paper, we take a unified view of the problems associated with concurrency control and recovery for transaction-oriented multiuser centralized database management systems, and we present several integrated mechanisms. We then develop analytical models to study the behavior and compare the performance of these integrated mechanisms, and we present the results of our performance evaluation.
