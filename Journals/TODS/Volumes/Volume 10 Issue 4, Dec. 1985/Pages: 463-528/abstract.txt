Modeling the storage structures of a DBMS is a prerequisite to understanding and optimizing database performance. Previously, such modeling was very difficult because the fundamental role of conceptual-to-internal mappings in DBMS implementations went unrecognized.In this paper we present a model of physical databases, called the transformation model, that makes conceptual-to-internal mappings explicit. By exposing such mappings, we show that it is possible to model the storage architectures (i.e., the storage structures and mappings) of many commercial DBMSs in a precise, systematic, and comprehendible way. Models of the INQUIRE, ADABAS, and SYSTEM 2000 storage architectures are presented as examples of the model's utility.We believe the transformation model helps bridge the gap between physical database theory and practice. It also reveals the possibility of a technology to automate the development of physical database software.
