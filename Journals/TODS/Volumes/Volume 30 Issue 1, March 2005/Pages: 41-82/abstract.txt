The skyline of ad-dimensional dataset contains the points that are not dominated by any other point on all dimensions. Skyline computation has recently received considerable attention in the database community, especially for progressive methods that can quickly return the initial results without reading the entire database. All the existing algorithms, however, have some serious shortcomings which limit their applicability in practice. In this article we develop branch-and-bound skyline (BBS), an algorithm based on nearest-neighbor search, which is I/O optimal, that is, it performs a single access only to those nodes that may contain skyline points. BBS is simple to implement and supports all types of progressive processing (e.g., user preferences, arbitrary dimensionality, etc). Furthermore, we propose several interesting variations of skyline computation, and show how BBS can be applied for their efficient processing.
