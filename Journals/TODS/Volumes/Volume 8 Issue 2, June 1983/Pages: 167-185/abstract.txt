In this paper we examine four performance enhancements to a database management system: dynamic compilation, microcoded routines, a special-purpose file system, and a special-purpose operating system. All were examined in the context of the INGRES database management system. Benchmark timings that are included suggest the attractiveness of dynamic compilation and a special-purpose file system. Microcode and a special-purpose operating system are analyzed and appear to be of more limited utility in the INGRES context.
