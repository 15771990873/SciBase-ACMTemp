The conventional models of authorization have been designed for database systems supporting the hierarchical, network, and relational models of data. However, these models are not adequate for next-generation database systems that support richer data models that include object-oriented concepts and semantic data modeling concepts. Rabitti, Woelk, and Kim [14] presented a preliminary model of authorization for use as the basis of an authorization mechanism in such database systems. In this paper we present a fuller model of authorization that fills a few major gaps that the conventional models of authorization cannot fill for next-generation database systems. We also further formalize the notion of implicit authorization and refine the application of the notion of implicit authorization to object-oriented and semantic modeling concepts. We also describe a user interface for using the model of authorization and consider key issues in implementing the authorization model.
