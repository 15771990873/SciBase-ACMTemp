Standard Information Retrieval (IR) metrics are not well suited for new paradigms like XML or Web IR in which retrievable information units are document elements and/or sets of related documents. Part of the problem stems from the classical hypotheses on the user models: They do not take into account the structural or logical context of document elements or the possibility of navigation between units. This article proposes an explicit and formal user model that encompasses a large variety of user behaviors. Based on this model, we extend the probabilistic precision-recall metric to deal with the new IR paradigms.
