Various logging and recovery techniques for centralized transaction-oriented database systems under performance aspects are described and discussed. The classification of functional principles that has been developed in a companion paper is used as a terminological basis. In the main sections, a set of analytic models is introduced and evaluated in order to compare the performance characteristics of nine different recovery techniques with respect to four key parameters and a set of other parameters with less influence. Finally, the results of model evaluation as well as the limitations of the models themselves are discussed.
