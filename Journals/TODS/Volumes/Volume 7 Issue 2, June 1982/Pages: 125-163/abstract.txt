The combination of the Content Addressable File Store (CAFS®; CAFS is a registered trademark of International Computers Limited) and an extension of relational analysis is described. This combination allows a simple and compact implementation of a database query and update language (FIDL). The language has one of the important properties of a “natural” language interface by using a “world model” derived from the relational analysis. The interpreter (FLIN) takes full advantage of the CAFS by employing a unique database storage technique which results in a fast response to both queries and updates.
