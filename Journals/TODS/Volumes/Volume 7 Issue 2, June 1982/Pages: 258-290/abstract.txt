The design and maintenance of a useful database system require efficient optimization of the logical access paths which demonstrate repetitive usage patterns. Views (classes of queries given by a query model) are an appropriate intermediate logical representation for database. Frequently accessed views of databases need to be supported by indexing to enhance retrieval. This paper investigates the problem of selecting an optimal index set of views and describes an efficient algorithm for this selection.
