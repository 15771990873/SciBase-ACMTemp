We propose an algorithm for detecting deadlocks among transactions running concurrently in a distributed processing network (i.e., a distributed database system). The proposed algorithm is a distributed deadlock detection algorithm. A proof of the correctness of the distributed portion of the algorithm is given, followed by an example of the algorithm in operation. The performance characteristics of the algorithm are also presented.
