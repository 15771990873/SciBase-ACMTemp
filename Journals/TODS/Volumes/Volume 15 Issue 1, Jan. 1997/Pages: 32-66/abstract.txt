We present a probabilistic relational algebra (PRA) which is a generalization of standard relational algebra. In PRA, tuples are assigned probabilistic weights giving the probability that a tuple belongs to a relation. Based on intensional semantics, the tuple weights of the result of a PRA expression always conform to the underlying probabilistic model. We also show for which expressions extensional semantics yields the same results. Furthermore, we discuss complexity issues and indicate possibilities for optimization. With regard to databases, the approach allows for representing imprecise attribute values, whereas for information retrieval, probabilistic document indexing and probabilistic search term weighting can be modeled. We introduce the concept of vague predicates which  yield probabilistic weights instead of Boolean values, thus allowing for queries with vague selection conditions. With these features, PRA implements uncertainty and vagueness in combination with the relational model.
