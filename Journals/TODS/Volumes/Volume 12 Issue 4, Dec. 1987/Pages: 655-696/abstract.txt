Both single-level and two-level indexed descriptor schemes for multikey retrieval are presented and compared. The descriptors are formed using superimposed coding techniques and stored using a bit-inversion technique. A fast-batch insertion algorithm for which the cost of forming the bit-inverted file is less than one disk access per record is presented. For large data files, it is shown that the two-level implementation is generally more efficient for queries with a small number of matching records. For queries that specify two or more values, there is a potential problem with the two-level implementation in that costs may accrue when blocks of records match the query but individual records within these blocks do not. One approach to overcoming this problem is to set bits in the descriptors based on pairs of indexed terms. This approach is presented and analyzed.
