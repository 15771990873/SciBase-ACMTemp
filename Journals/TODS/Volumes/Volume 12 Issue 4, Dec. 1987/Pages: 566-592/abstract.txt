In commercial network database management systems, set-valued fields and aggregate functions are commonly supported. However, the relational database model, as defined by Codd, does not include set-valued attributes or aggregate functions. Recently, Klug extended the relational model by incorporating aggregate functions and by defining relational algebra and calculus languages.In this paper, relational algebra and relational calculus database query languages (as defined by Klug) are extended to manipulate set-valued attributes and to utilize aggregate functions. The expressive power of the extended languages is shown to be equivalent. We extend the relational algebra with three new operators, namely, pack, unpack, and aggregation-by-template. The extended languages form a theoretical framework for statistical database query languages.
