File organizations based on conventional hash functions provide faster access to the stored records in comparison with tree-like file structures. Tree structures such as B+-trees and ISAM do provide for sequential processing, but require considerable storage for the indices. When sequential processing is needed a table that performs an order-preserving transformation on keys can be used. H is an order-preserving key transform if H(K1) &ges; H(K2), for all keys K1> K2. We present methodologies for constructing such key transforms, and illustrate them for some real-life key sets. Storage requirements for the table needed to carry out the transformation are less than those needed    for the indices.
