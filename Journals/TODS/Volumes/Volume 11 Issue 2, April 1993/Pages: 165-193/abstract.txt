We review Structured Analysis as presented by Yourdon and DeMarco. First, we examine the implicit assumptions embodied in the method about the nature of organizations, work processes, and design. Following this we present the results of an exploratory study, conducted to find out how the method is applied in practice. This study reveals that while some of the tools of Structured Analysis—notably the data flow diagrams—are used and combined with other tools, the designers do not follow the analysis and design procedures prescribed by the method. Our findings suggest that there is a gap between the way systems development is portrayed in the normative technical literature and the way in which it is carried out.
