We give a straightforward definition for redundancy in individual nested relations and define a new normal form that precisely characterizes redundancy for nested relations. We base our definition of redundancy on an arbitrary set of functional and multivalued dependencies, and show that our definition of nested normal form generalizes standard relational normalization theory. In addition, we give a condition that can prevent an unwanted structural anomaly in nested relations, namely, embedded nested relations with at most one tuple. Like other normal forms, our nested normal form can serve as a guide for database design.
