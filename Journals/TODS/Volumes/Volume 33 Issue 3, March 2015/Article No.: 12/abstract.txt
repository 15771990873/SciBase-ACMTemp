We present in this article an external memory algorithm, called disk SA-IS (DSA-IS), to exactly emulate the induced sorting algorithm SA-IS previously proposed for sorting suffixes in RAM. DSA-IS is a new disk-friendly method for sequentially retrieving the preceding character of a sorted suffix to induce the order of the preceding suffix. For a sizenstring of a constant or integer alphabet, given the RAM capacity Î© ((nW)0.5), whereWis the size of each I/O buffer that is large enough to amortize the overhead of each access to disk, both the CPU time and peak disk use of DSA-IS areO(n). Our experimental study shows that on average, DSA-IS achieves the best time and space results of all of the existing external memory algorithms based on the induced sorting principle.
