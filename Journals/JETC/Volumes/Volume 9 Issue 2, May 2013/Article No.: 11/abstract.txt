Memristive devices with a simple structure are not only very small but also very versatile, which makes them an ideal candidate used for the next generation computing system in the post-Si era. The working mechanism of the devices and a family of nanodevices built based on this working mechanism are introduced first followed by some proposed applications of these novel devices. The promises and challenges of these devices are then discussed, together with the significant progresses made recently in dealing with these challenges.
