Quantum-dot cellular automata is an interesting computation fabric with many never-seen-before properties. However, no programmable fabric scheme has utilized all these properties effectively. We propose an architecture for a programmable device using molecular QCA which exploits all the specialities of the fabric. The architecture taps the flexibility provided by the clocking system of molecular QCA to build a simple tile-based programmable device with the 3-input Majority gate as the fundamental logic element. Observing how a QCA structure can behave as either an interconnect or a logic gate depending on clocking, the proposed architecture merges routing and logic elements, thus drastically changing how programmable fabrics have been designed.
