Advances in fabrication technology of nanoscale devices such as nanowires, carbon nanotubes and molecular switches provide new opportunities for implementing cluster-based FPGAs. Extensive research is needed to evaluate area and performance of FPGAs made from these devices and compare with their CMOS counterparts. In this work, we propose a hybrid FPGA that uses nanoscale clusters with a functionality similar to the clusters of traditional CMOS FPGAs. The proposed cluster is constructed by a crossbar of nanowires and can be configured to implement the required LUTs and intracluster MUXes. A CMOS interface is also proposed to provide configuration and memory elements for the nanoscale cluster. In the proposed architecture, inter-cluster routing remains at CMOS scale. We have developed models for area and delay of clusters and interconnects of the proposed hybrid FPGA. FPGA tools are configured with these models and used to synthesize and configure the benchmark circuits onto the hybrid FPGAs with NiSi nanowires or nanotubes. Experiments are conducted to evaluate and compare area and performance of the hybrid FPGA and traditional CMOS FPGA (scaled to 22nm). Up to 82&percnt; area reduction was obtained from implementing MCNC benchmarks on the hybrid FPGA. Performance of the hybrid FPGA is shown to be close to that of CMOS FPGA.
