Advances in microfluidics technology offer exciting possibilities in the realm of enzymatic analysis, DNA analysis, proteomic analysis involving proteins and peptides, immunoassays, implantable drug delivery devices, and environmental toxicity monitoring. Microfluidics-based biochips are therefore gaining popularity for clinical diagnostics and other laboratory procedures involving molecular biology. As more bioassays are executed concurrently on a biochip, system integration and design complexity are expected to increase dramatically. This paper presents different actuation mechanisms for microfluidics-based biochips, as well as associated design automation trends and challenges. The underlying physical principles of eletrokinetics, electrohydrodynamics, and thermo-capillarity are discussed. Next, the paper presents an overview of an integrated system-level design methodology that attempts to address key issues in the modeling, simulation, synthesis, testing and reconfiguration of digital microfluidics-based biochips. The top-down design automation will facilitate the integration of fluidic components with microelectronic component in next-generation system-on-chip designs.
