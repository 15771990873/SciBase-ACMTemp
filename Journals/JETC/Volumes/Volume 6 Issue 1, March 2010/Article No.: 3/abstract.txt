The integration of novel nanotechnologies onto silicon platforms is likely to increase fabrication defects compared with traditional CMOS technologies. Furthermore, the number of nodes connected with these networks makes acquiring a global defect map impractical. As a result, on-chip networks will provide defect tolerance by self-organizing into irregular topologies. In this scenario, simple static routing algorithms based on regular physical topologies, such as meshes, will be inadequate. Additionally, previous routing approaches for irregular networks assume abundant resources and do not apply to this domain of resource-constrained self-organizing nano-scale networks. Consequently, routing algorithms that work in irregular networks with limited resources are needed.In this article, we explore routing for self-organizing nano-scale irregular networks in the context of a Self-Organizing SIMD Architecture (SOSA). Our approach trades configuration time and a small amount of storage for reduced communication latency. We augment an Euler path-based routing technique for trees to generate static shortest paths between certain pairs of nodes while remaining deadlock free. Simulations of several applications executing on SOSA show our proposed routing algorithm can reduce execution time by 8&percent; to 30&percent;.
