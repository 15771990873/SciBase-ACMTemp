Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) is a novel computing mechanism that can represent binary information based on spatial distribution of an electron charge configuration in chemical molecules. In this article, we present the first partitioning and placement algorithm for automatic QCA layout. We identify several objectives and constraints that will enhance the buildability of QCA circuits. The results are intended to: (1) define what is computationally interesting and could actually be built within a set of predefined constraints, (2) project what designs will be possible as additional constructs become realizable, and (3) provide a vehicle that we can use to compare QCA systems to silicon-based systems.
