Multihop communication links in conventional Networks-on-Chips (NoCs) results in lower rates of data transfer and higher energy dissipation. Long-range millimeter-wave wireless interconnects were envisioned to alleviate this problem. However, the available bandwidth of the wireless channels is limited and hence an efficient media access control (MAC) scheme is required to enhance the utilization of the available bandwidth. In this article we show that with multiple simultaneous access of the shared wireless medium using a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) scheme the peak performance can be improved significantly while lowering energy dissipation in data transfer compared to the conventional wireline counterparts as well as state-of-the-art Wireless NoCs using similar technologies. We present a thorough analysis of the reliability in data transfer using the CDMA based wireless links and show that a reliability-aware architecture design with CDMA based wireless links can lower the energy dissipation in NoC fabrics without compromising the achievable robustness.
