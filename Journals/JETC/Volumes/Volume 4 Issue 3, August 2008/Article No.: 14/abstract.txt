Novel strategies are necessary to efficiently test and configure emerging reconfigurable nanoscale devices, in addition to providing defect tolerance. This is mainly due to the high defect densities that are expected for these devices. Among different approaches, reconfiguration-based defect avoidance has proven to be a practical solution. However, configuration time, test time, and defect-map size remain among the major challenges for these new devices. In this article, we propose a new approach (called SCT) that simultaneously performs test and configuration. The proposed method uses a built-in self-test (BIST) scheme for test and defect tolerance. The method is based on testing reconfigurable nanoblocks at the time of implementing a function of a desired application on that block. The SCT method considerably reduces the total test and configuration time. It also eliminates the need for storing the location of defects in a defect map on- or off-chip. The presented probabilistic analysis results show the effectiveness of this method in terms of test and configuration time for architectures with rich interconnect resources. Also, a Verilog simulation model is developed for crossbar-based nano-architectures. This model is used to implement several MCNC benchmarks based on the proposed SCT method. The simulation results demonstrate efficiency of the method in terms of test time and yield under different defect rates.
