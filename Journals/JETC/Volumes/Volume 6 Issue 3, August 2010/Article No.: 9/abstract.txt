Quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) has been advocated as a promising emerging nanotechnology for designing future nanocomputing systems. However, at device level, the large number of expected defects represents a significant hurdle for reliable computation in QCA-based systems. In this paper, we present an information-theoretic approach to investigate the relationship between defect tolerance and redundancy in QCA devices. By modeling defect-prone QCA devices as unreliable information processing media, we determine the information transfer capacity, as bound on the reliability that QCA devices can achieve. The proposed method allows to evaluate the effectiveness of redundancy-based defect tolerance in an effective and quantitative manner.
