In this article, the problem of synthesizing a general Hermitian quantum gate into a set of primary quantum gates is addressed. To this end, an extended version of the Jacobi approach for calculating the eigenvalues of Hermitian matrices in linear algebra is considered as the basis of the proposed synthesis method. The quantum circuit synthesis method derived from the Jacobi approach and its optimization challenges are described. It is shown that the proposed method results in multiple-control rotation gates around theyaxis, multiple-control phase shift gates, multiple-control NOT gates, and a middle diagonal Hermitian matrix, which can be synthesized to multiple-control PauliZgates. Using the proposed approach, it is shown how multiple-controlUgates, whereUis a single-qubit Hermitian quantum gate, can be implemented using a linear number of elementary gates in terms of circuit lines with the aid of one auxiliary qubit in an arbitrary state.
