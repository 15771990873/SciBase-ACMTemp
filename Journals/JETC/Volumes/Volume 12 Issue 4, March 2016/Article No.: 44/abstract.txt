Optical Networks-on-Chip (ONoCs) are a promising technology to overcome the bottleneck of low bandwidth of electronic Networks-on-Chip. Recent research discusses power and performance benefits of ONoCs based on their system-level design, while layout effects are typically overlooked. As a consequence, laser power requirements are inaccurately computed from the logic scheme but do not consider the layout. In this article, we propose PROTON+, a fast tool for placement and routing of 3D ONoCs minimizing the total laser power. Using our tool, the required laser power of the system can be decreased by up to 94&percnt; compared to a state-of-the-art manually designed layout. In addition, with the help of our tool, we study the physical design space of ONoC topologies. For this purpose, topology synthesis methods (e.g., global connectivity and network partitioning) as well as different objective function weights are analyzed in order to minimize the maximum insertion loss and ultimately the systemâ€™s laser power consumption. For the first time, we study optimal positions of memory controllers. A comparison of our algorithm to a state-of-the-art placer for electronic circuits shows the need for a different set of tools custom-tailored for the particular requirements of optical interconnects.
