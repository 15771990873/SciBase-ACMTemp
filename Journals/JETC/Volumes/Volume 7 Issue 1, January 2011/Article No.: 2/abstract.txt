This article quantitatively considers the performance of nanomagnetic logic circuits within the context of realistic drive circuitry. We also demonstrate how one of the five fundamental tenets of digital logic---preventing unwanted feedback---can be satisfied by realistic drive circuitry. More specifically, different types of multiphase clocks are investigated and compared. Initial projections suggest that even with drive circuitry overhead, nanomagnet logic can outperform subthreshold CMOS in terms of energy delay product---and paths to lower power exist.
