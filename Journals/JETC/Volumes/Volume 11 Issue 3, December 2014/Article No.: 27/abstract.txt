RIMEP (Reversible Improved Multi Expression Programming), is a system that has been developed for designing reversible digital circuits. This article discloses a new version of RIMEP called “RIMEP2”. The goal was to evolve reversible circuits in a “fanout free” search space. The major changes that RIMEP has undergone, are made in the structure of the chromosome and in the fitness calculation. Although the changes seem to be minor, the impact is effective. The execution time has been considerably decreased and optimal competitive solutions were found for a set of 30 selected benchmarks, where a quantum cost reduction up to 96.13&percnt; was reached with an average of 42.17&percnt;.
