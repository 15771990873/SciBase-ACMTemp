In this article, we present a graphical Computer-Aided Design (CAD) environment for the design, analysis, and layout of Carbon NanoTube (CNT) Field-Effect Transistor (CNFET) circuits. This work is motivated by the fact that such a tool currently does not exist in the public domain for researchers. Our tool has been integrated within Electric a very powerful, yet free CAD system for custom design of Integrated Circuits (ICs). The tool supports CNFET schematic and layout entry, rule checking, and HSpice/VerilogA netlist generation. We provide users with a customizable CNFET technology library with the ability to specify Î»-based design rules. We showcase the capabilities of our tool by demonstrating the design of a large CNFET standard cell and components library. Meanwhile, HSPICE simulations also have been presented for cell library characterization. We hope that the availability of this tool will invigorate the CAD community to explore novel ideas in CNFET circuit design.
