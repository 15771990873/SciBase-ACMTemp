A fast method to identify the given Boolean function as a threshold function with weight assignment is introduced. It characterizes the function based on the parameters that have been defined in the literature. The proposed method is capable to quickly characterize all functions that have less than eight inputs and has been shown to operate fast for functions with as many as forty inputs. Furthermore, comparisons with other existing heuristic methods show huge increase in the number of threshold functions identified, and drastic reduction in time and complexity.
