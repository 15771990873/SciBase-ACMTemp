This article extends our prior work to show that a straightforward use of 3D stacking technology enables the design of compact energy-efficient servers. Our proposed architecture, called PicoServer, employs 3D technology to bond one die containing several simple, slow processing cores to multiple memory dies sufficient for a primary memory. The multiple memory dies are composed of DRAM. This use of 3D stacks readily facilitates wide low-latency buses between processors and memory. These remove the need for an L2 cache allowing its area to be re-allocated to additional simple cores. The additional cores allow the clock frequency to be lowered without impairing throughput. Lower clock frequency means that thermal constraints, a concern with 3D stacking, are easily satisfied. We extend our original analysis on PicoServer to include: (1) a wider set of server workloads, (2) the impact of multithreading, and (3) the on-chip DRAM architecture and system memory usage. PicoServer is intentionally simple, requiring only the simplest form of 3D technology where die are stacked on top of one another. Our intent is to minimize risk of introducing a new technology (3D) to implement a class of low-cost, low-power compact server architectures.
