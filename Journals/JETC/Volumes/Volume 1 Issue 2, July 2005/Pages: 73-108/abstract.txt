A key challenge facing nanotechnologies is learning to control uncertainty introduced by stochastic self-assembly. In this article, we explore architectural and manufacturing strategies to cope with this uncertainty when assembling nanoarrays, crossbars composed of two orthogonal sets of parallel nanowires (NWs) that are differentiated at their time of manufacture. NW deposition is a stochastic process and the NW encodings present in an array cannot be known in advance. We explore the reliable construction of memories from stochastically assembled arrays. This is accomplished by describing several families of NW encodings and developing strategies to map external binary addresses onto internal NW encodings using programmable circuitry. We explore a variety of different mapping strategies and develop probabilistic methods of analysis. This is the first article that makes clear the wide range of choices that are available.
