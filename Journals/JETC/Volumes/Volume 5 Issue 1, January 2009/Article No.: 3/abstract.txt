The continued miniaturization of silicon-based electronic circuits is fast approaching its physical limitations. It is unlikely that advances in miniaturization, following the so-called Moore's Law, can continue in the foreseeable future. Nanoelectronics has to go beyond silicon technology. New device paradigms based on nanoscale materials, such as molecular electronic devices, spin devices and carbon-based devices, will emerge. In this article, we introduce a nanodevice paradigm: graphene nanoelectronics. Due to its unique quantum effects and electronic properties, researchers predict that graphene-based devices may replace carbon nanotube devices and become major building blocks for future nanoscale computing. To manifest its unique electronic properties, we present some of our recent designs, namely a graphene-based switch, a negative differential resistance (NDR) device and a random access memory array (RAM). Since these basic devices are the building blocks for large-scale circuits, our findings can help researchers construct useful computing systems and study graphene-based circuit performance in the future.
