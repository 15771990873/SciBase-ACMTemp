A multipurpose simulator for ballistic nanostructures, based on classical mechanics of electrons at the Fermi level, has been successfully implemented. Despite the simplicity of the model, the simulator successfully reproduces a number of experimental results, and is shown to consistently match observed current-voltage characteristics and magnetoresistance phenomena. The simulator results provide design guidelines for devices which operate on ballistic transport principles. Using the simulator, preliminary logic structures have been designed based on the ballistic deflection transistor.
