This article investigates, via analytic modeling, how a magnetic QCA wire should be organized to provide the highest reliability. We compare a nonredundant wire and two redundant wire organizations. For all three organizations, a fault rate per unit length is used for comparison; additionally, since extra components are necessary to implement the redundant organizations, these components are faulty as well. We show that the difference between these two fault rates is the main driver for selecting a wire organization. Lastly, we develop a guideline for selecting the most reliable wire organization during the circuit design process.
