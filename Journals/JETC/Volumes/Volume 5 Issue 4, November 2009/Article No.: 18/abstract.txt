Emerging technologies such as silicon NanoWires (NW) and Carbon NanoTubes (CNT) have shown great potential for building the next generation of computing systems in the nano ranges. However, the excessive number of defects originating from bottom-up fabrication (such as a self-assembly process) poses a pressing challenge for achieving scalable system integration. This article proposes a new nanosystem architecture that employs nanowire crossbars for Digital Signal Processing (DSP) applications. Distributed arithmetic is utilized such that complex signal processing computation can be mapped into regular memory operations, thus making this architecture well suited for implementation by nanowire crossbars. Furthermore, the inherent features of DSP-type computation provide new insights to remedy errors (as logic/computational manifestation of defects). A new defect/error-tolerant technique that exploits algorithmic error compensation is proposed; at system level different trade-offs between correctness in output and performance are established while retaining low overhead in its implementation. As an instance of its application, the proposed approach has been utilized to a generic DSP nanosystem performing frequency-selective filtering. Simulation results show that the proposed nanoDSP introduces only a minor performance degradation under high defect rates and at a range of operational conditions. The proposed technique also features good scalability and viability for various DSP applications.
