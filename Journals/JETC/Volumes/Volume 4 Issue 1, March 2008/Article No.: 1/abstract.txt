We summarize the main characteristics of the quantum logic array (QLA) architecture with a careful look at the key issues not described in the original conference publications: primarily, the teleportation-based logical interconnect. The design goal of the the quantum logic array architecture is to illustrate a model for a large-scale quantum architecture that solves the primary challenges of system-level reliability and data distribution over large distances. The QLA's logical interconnect design, which employs the quantum repeater protocol, is in principle capable of supporting the communication requirements for applications as large as the factoring of a 2048-bit number using Shor's quantum factoring algorithm. Our physical-level assumptions and architectural component validations are based on the trapped ion technology for implementing quantum computing.
