Reversible logic has applications in low-power computing and quantum computing. Most reversible logic synthesis methods are tied to particular gate types, and cannot synthesize large functions. This article extends RMRLS, a reversible logic synthesis tool, to include additional gate types. While classic RMRLS can synthesize functions using NOT, CNOT, andn-bit Toffoli gates, our work details the inclusion ofn-bit Fredkin and Peres gates. We find that these additional gates reduce the average gate count for three-variable functions from 6.10 to 4.56, and improve the synthesis results of many larger functions, both in terms of gate count and quantum cost.
