We present two novel energy-efficient pipeline templates for high throughput asynchronous circuits. The proposed templates, called N-P and N-Inverter pipelines, use a single-track handshake protocol. There are multiple stages of logic within each pipeline. The proposed techniques minimize handshake overheads associated with input tokens and intermediate logic nodes within a pipeline template. Each template can pack a significant amount of logic in a single stage, while still maintaining a fast cycle time of only 18 transitions. Noise and timing robustness constraints of our pipelined circuits are quantified across all process corners. We present completion detection scheme based on wide NOR gates, which results in significant latency and energy savings especially as the number of outputs increase. To fully quantify all design trade-offs, three separate pipeline implementations of an 8x8-bit Booth-encoded array multiplier are presented. Compared to a standard QDI pipeline implementation, the N-Inverter and N-P pipeline implementations reduced the energy-delay product by 38.5&percnt; and 44&percnt; respectively. The overall multiplier latency was reduced by 20.2&percnt; and 18.7&percnt;, while the total transistor width was reduced by 35.6&percnt; and 46&percnt; with N-Inverter and N-P pipeline templates respectively.
