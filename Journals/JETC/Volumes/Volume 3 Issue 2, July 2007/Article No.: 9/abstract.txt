The multicellular structure of biological organisms and the interpretation in each of their cells of a chemical program (the DNA string orgenome) is the source of inspiration for the Embryonics (embryonic electronics) project, whose final objective is the design of highly robust integrated circuits, endowed with properties usually associated with the living world: self-repair and self-replication. In this article, we provide an overview of our latest research in the domain of the self-replication of processing elements within a programmable logic substrate, a key prerequisite for achieving system-level fault tolerance in our bio-inspired approach.
