As current microelectronics will reach their physical limits within the foreseeable future, emerging technologies may offer a solution for maintaining the trends to increase computing performance. Biologically-inspired and quantum computing represent two emerging technology vectors for novel computing architectures within nanoelectronics. However, potential benefits will come at the cost of increased device sensitivity to the surrounding environment. This article provides a dependability perspective over these technologies from a designer's standpoint. Maintaining or increasing the dependability of unconventional computational processes is discussed in two different contexts, a bio-inspired computing architecture (theEmbryonicsproject) and a quantum computational architecture (theQUERISTproject).
