Discrete linear transformations are important tools in information processing. Many such transforms are injective and therefore prime candidates for a physically reversible implementation into hardware. We present here reversible integer cosine transformations onninput integers. The resulting reversible circuit is able to perform both the forward transform and the inverse transform. The detailed structure of such a reversible design strongly depends on the odd prime factors of the determinant of the transform: whether those are of the form 2k± 1 or of the form 2k± 2l± 1 or neither of these forms.
