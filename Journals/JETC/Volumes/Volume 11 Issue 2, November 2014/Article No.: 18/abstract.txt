Searching for a particular pattern in a very large DNA database is a fundamental and essential component in computational biology. In the biological world, pattern matching is required for finding repeats in a particular DNA sequence, finding motif, aligning sequences, and other similar tasks. Due to an immense amount and continuous increase of biological data, the searching process requires very fast algorithms. A function-based tool set for fast offline pattern searches in large DNA sequences is proposed. The method benefits from the use of Boolean functions, their compact storage using canonical data structure, and the existence of built-in operators for these data structures. Experiments on DNA sequences from the NCBI database show that the proposed approach is scalable. The time complexity depends on the size of the data structure used for storing the function that represents the DNA sequence. It is shown that the presented approach exhibits sublinear time complexity to the DNA sequence size.
