Quantum computation onwqubits is represented by the infinite unitary group U(2w); classical reversible computation onwbits is represented by the finite symmetric groupS2w. In order to establish the relationship between classical reversible computing and quantum computing, we introduce two Lie subgroups XU(n) and ZU(n) of the unitary group U(n). The former consists of all unitaryn×nmatrices with all line sums equal to 1; the latter consists of all unitary diagonaln×nmatrices with first entry equal to 1. Such a group structure also reveals the relationship between matrix calculus and diagrammatic zx-calculus of quantum circuits.
