Heat generation limits the performance of state-of-the-art integrated circuits, originating from the wasteful static CMOS operating principle. Near-term solutions like adiabatic charging for energy recovery and limiting friction-type heat sources provide considerable improvement. However, these methods do not address the ultimate thermodynamic necessity to expel energy related to information loss in the computing process. In emerging beyond-CMOS technologies, this bit erasure heat alone can overwhelm the cooling capacity and set the limits of the computing performance. Therefore, logical information loss is becoming an important factor for digital circuit design, and tools have to be developed for analysis and optimization. This article presents a framework for estimating the amount of information loss in complex logic circuits, demonstrating the method by modeling the irreversible bit erasures in a standard binary adder structure. Binary addition is one of the most often used and highly optimized digital designs, and we estimate the erasure bounds for components on various levels of design abstraction, showing that the actual logic gate implementations have orders of magnitude higher loss than the addition operation itself would require. The method and the results can be used to optimize circuits for a higher degree of logical reversibility and energy conservation.
