BioCoder is a C&plus;&plus; library developed at Microsoft Research, India, for the unambiguous specification of biochemical assays. This article describes language extensions to BioCoder along with a compiler and runtime system that translate and execute assays specified using BioCoder on a software simulator. The simulator mimics the behavior of laboratories-on-a-chip (LoCs) based on a droplet actuation technology called electrowetting on dielectric (EWoD). To date, prior compilers targeting similar EWoD devices are limited to assays specified as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and cannot handle arbitrary control flow or feedback from the LoC. The framework presented herein addresses these challenges through dynamic interpretation, thereby enlarging the space of assays that can be compiled onto EWoD devices.
