In order to continue the performance and scaling trends that we have come to expect from Mooreâ€™s Law, many emergent computational models, devices, and technologies are actively being studied to either replace or augment CMOS technology. Nanomagnet Logic (NML) is one such alternative. NML operates at room temperature, it has the potential for low power consumption, and it is CMOS compatible. In this aricle, we present an NML programmable logic array (PLA) based on a previously proposed reprogrammable quantum-dot cellular automata PLA design. We also discuss the fabrication and simulation validation of the circuit structures unique to the NML PLA, present area, energy, and delay estimates for the NML PLA, compare the area of NML PLAs to other reprogrammable nanotechnologies, and analyze how architectural-level redundancy will affect performance and defect tolerance in NML PLAs. We will use results from this study to shape a concluding discussion about, which architectures appear to be most suitable for NML.
