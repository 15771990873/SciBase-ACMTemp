A feasible computational framework that enables improved predictability of NBTI degradation within commercially available tools is discussed. The NBTI model is used for real-time circuit operation where recovery is present. The complementary nature of implementation is readily incorporated into existing model extraction and verification tools. The method provides significantly enhanced accuracy in simulations when compared to circuit data, yet retains practicality and flexibility.
