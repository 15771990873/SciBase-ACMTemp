Microfluidics-based biochips for biochemical analysis are currently receiving much attention. They automate highly repetitive laboratory procedures by replacing cumbersome equipment with miniaturized and integrated systems. As these microfluidics-based microsystems become more complex, manufacturing yield will have significant influence on production volume and product cost. We propose an interstitial redundancy approach to enhance the yield of biochips that are based on droplet-based digital microfluidics. In this design method, spare cells are placed in the interstitial sites within the microfluidic array, and they replace neighboring faulty cells via local reconfiguration. The proposed design method is evaluated using a set of concurrent real-life bioassays. The defect-tolerant design approach based on space redundancy and local reconfiguration is expected to facilitate yield enhancement of microfluidics-based biochips, especially for the emerging marketplace.
