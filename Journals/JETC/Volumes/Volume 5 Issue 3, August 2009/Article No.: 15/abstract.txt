Power consumption poses one of the fundamental barriers for deploying mobile computing devices in energy-constrained situations with varying operation conditions. In particular, leakage power is projected to increase exponentially in future semiconductor process nodes. This challenging problem is pressing for renewed focus on power-performance optimization at all levels of design abstract, from novel device structures to fundamental shifts in design paradigm. In this article, we propose to exploit the programmable threshold voltage quantum dot (QD) transistors to reduce leakage thereby improving the energy efficiency for mobile computing. The unique programmability and reconfigurability enabled by QD transistors extend our capability in design optimization for new power-performance trade-offs. Simulation results demonstrate the significant leakage reduction over conventional techniques.
