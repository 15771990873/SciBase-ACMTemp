Quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) technology is now considered to be one of the prospective technologies for a nanocomputer creation. The physical properties of QCA and its expanding range of computer applications make it expedient to use the novel paradigm of nanocomputer architecture: serial decimal storage-transfer-processing. The delay-based encoding of decimal digits allows the use a delay element as a main element of QCA serial arithmetic units. The simple implementation of the delay element by a short length of QCA wire results in reduction of complexity and of the area required for a QCA circuit. The theoretical basics of delay-based processing-in-wire and design examples of QCA serial decimal arithmetic units are presented.
