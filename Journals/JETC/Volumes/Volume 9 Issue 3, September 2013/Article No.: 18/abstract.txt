The article introduces a novel approach to color image processing that utilizes multi-peak resonant tunneling diodes for encoding color information in quantized states of the diodes. The Multi-Peak Resonant Tunneling Diodes (MPRTDs) are organized as a two-dimensional array of vertical pillars which are locally connected by programmable passive and active elements with a view to realizing a wide variety of color image processing functions such as quantization, color extraction, image smoothing, edge detection, and line detection. In order to process color information in the input images, two different methods for color representation schemes have been used: one using color mapping and the other using direct RGB representation. Finally, the article uses HSPICE simulation methods for the nestlist of the proposed RTD-based nanoarchitecture in order to verify a candidate of image functions by using the afore-mentioned representation methods.
