Improving the vulnerability to soft errors is one of the important design goals for future architecture design of Chip-MultiProcessors (CMPs). In this study, we explore the soft error characteristics of CMPs with 3D stacked NonVolatile Memory (NVM), in particular, the Spin-Transfer Torque Random Access Memory (STT-RAM), whose cells are immune to radiation-induced soft errors and do not have endurance problems. We use 3D stacking as an enabler for modular integration of STT-RAM memories with minimum disruption in the baseline processor design flow, while providing further interconnection and capacity advantages. We take an in-depth look at alternative replacement schemes to explore the soft error resilience benefits and design trade-offs of 3D stacked STT-RAM and capture the multivariable optimization challenges microprocessor architectures face. We propose a vulnerability metric, with respect to the instruction and data in the core pipeline and through the cache hierarchy, to present a comprehensive system evaluation with respect to reliability, performance, and power consumption for our CMP architectures. Our experimental results show that, for the average workload, replacing memories with an STT-RAM alternative significantly mitigates soft errors on-chip, improves the performance by 14.15&percnt;, and reduces power consumption by 13.44&percnt;.
