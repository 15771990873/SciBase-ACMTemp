Grouping 3D objects into (semantically) meaningful categories is a challenging and important problem in 3D mining and shape processing. Here, we present a novel approach to categorize 3D objects. The method described in this article, is a belief-function-based approach and consists of two stages: the training stage, where 3D objects in the same category are processed and a set of representative parts is constructed, and the labeling stage, where unknown objects are categorized. The experimental results obtained on the Tosca-Sumner and the Shrec07 datasets show that the system efficiently performs in categorizing 3D models.
