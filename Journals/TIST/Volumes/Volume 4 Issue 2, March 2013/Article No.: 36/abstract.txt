This article describes the planner CpA(H), the recipient of theBest Nonobservable Nondeterministic Planner Awardin the “Uncertainty Track” of the 6thInternational Planning Competition (IPC), 2008. The article presents the various techniques that help CpA(H) to achieve the level of performance and scalability exhibited in the competition. The article also presents experimental results comparing CpA(H) with state-of-the-art conformant planners.
