For reasons of public security, an intelligent surveillance system that can cover a large, crowded public area has become an urgent need. In this article, we propose a novel laser-based system that can simultaneously perform tracking, semantic scene learning, and abnormality detection in a fully online and unsupervised way. Furthermore, these three tasks cooperate with each other in one framework to improve their respective performances. The proposed system has the following key advantages over previous ones: (1) It can cover quite a large area (more than 60×35m), and simultaneously perform robust tracking, semantic scene learning, and abnormality detection in a high-density situation. (2) The overall system can vary with time, incrementally learn the structure of the scene, and perform fully online abnormal activity detection and tracking. This feature makes our system suitable for real-time applications. (3) The surveillance tasks are carried out in a fully unsupervised manner, so that there is no need for manual labeling and the construction of huge training datasets. We successfully apply the proposed system to the JR subway station in Tokyo, and demonstrate that it can cover an area of 60×35m, robustly track more than 150 targets at the same time, and simultaneously perform online semantic scene learning and abnormality detection with no human intervention.
