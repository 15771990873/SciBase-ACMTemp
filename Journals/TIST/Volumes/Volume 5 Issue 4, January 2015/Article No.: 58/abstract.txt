Recent advances in mobile devices and their sensing capabilities have enabled the collection of rich contextual information and mobile device usage records through the device logs. These context-rich logs open a venue for mining the personal preferences of mobile users under varying contexts and thus enabling the development of personalized context-aware recommendation and other related services, such as mobile online advertising. In this article, we illustrate how to extract personal context-aware preferences from the context-rich device logs, orcontext logsfor short, and exploit these identified preferences for building personalized context-aware recommender systems. A critical challenge along this line is that the context log of each individual user may not contain sufficient data for mining his or her context-aware preferences. Therefore, we propose to first learn common context-aware preferences from the context logs of many users. Then, the preference of each user can be represented as a distribution of these common context-aware preferences. Specifically, we develop two approaches for mining common context-aware preferences based on two different assumptions, namely, context-independent and context-dependent assumptions, which can fit into different application scenarios. Finally, extensive experiments on a real-world dataset show that both approaches are effective and outperform baselines with respect to mining personal context-aware preferences for mobile users.
