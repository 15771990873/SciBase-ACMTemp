Sponsored search has been proven to be a successful business model, and sponsored search auctions have become a hot research direction. There have been many exciting advances in this field, especially in recent years, while at the same time, there are also many open problems waiting for us to resolve. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of sponsored search auctions in hopes of helping both industry practitioners and academic researchers to become familiar with this field, to know the state of the art, and to identify future research topics. Specifically, we organize the article into two parts. In the first part, we review research works on sponsored search auctions with basic settings, where fully rational advertisers without budget constraints, preknown click-through rates (CTRs) without interdependence, and exact match between queries and keywords are assumed. Under these assumptions, we first introduce the generalized second price (GSP) auction, which is the most popularly used auction mechanism in the industry. Then we give the definitions of several well-studied equilibria and review the latest results on GSPâ€™s efficiency and revenue in these equilibria. In the second part, we introduce some advanced topics on sponsored search auctions. In these advanced topics, one or more assumptions made in the basic settings are relaxed. For example, the CTR of an ad could be unknown and dependent on other ads; keywords could be broadly matched to queries before auctions are executed; and advertisers are not necessarily fully rational, could have budget constraints, and may prefer rich bidding languages. Given that the research on these advanced topics is still immature, in each section of the second part, we provide our opinions on how to make further advances, in addition to describing what has been done by researchers in the corresponding direction.
