Modeling the dynamics of biological processes has recently become an important research topic in computational biology and systems engineering. One of the most important reasons to model a biological process is to enable high-throughputin-silicoexperiments that attempt to predict or intervene in the process. These experiments can help accelerate the design of therapies through their rapid and inexpensive replication and alteration. While some techniques exist for reasoning with biological processes, few take advantage of the flexible and scalable algorithms popular in AI research. In reasoning about interventions in biological processes, where scalability is crucial for feasible application, we apply AI planning-based search techniques and demonstrate their advantage over existing enumerative methods. We also present a novel formulation of intervention planning that relies on models that characterize and attempt to change the phenotype of a system. We study three biological systems: the yeast cell cycle, a model of the human aging process, and the Wnt5a network governing the metastasis of melanoma in humans. The contribution of our investigation is in demonstrating that: (i) prior approaches, based on dynamic programming, cannot scale as well as heuristic search, and (ii) the newly found scalability enables us to plan previously unknown sequences of interventions that reveal novel and biologically significant responses in the systems which are consistent with biological knowledge in the literature.
