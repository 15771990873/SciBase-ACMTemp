Forces involved in modern conflicts may be exposed to a variety of threats, including coordinated raids of advanced ballistic and cruise missiles. To respond to these, a defending force will rely on a set of combat resources. Determining an efficient allocation and coordinated use of these resources, particularly in the case of multiple simultaneous attacks, is a very complex decision-making process in which a huge amount of data must be dealt with under uncertainty and time pressure. This article presents CORALS (COmbat Resource ALlocation Support), a real-time planner developed to support the command team of a naval force defending against multiple simultaneous threats. In response to such multiple threats, CORALS uses a local planner to generate a set of local plans, one for each threat considered apart, and then combines and coordinates them into a single optimized, conflict-free global plan. The coordination is performed through an iterative process of plan merging and conflict detection and resolution, which acts as a plan repair mechanism. Such an incremental plan repair approach also allows adapting previously generated plans to account for dynamic changes in the tactical situation.
