Collaborative Filtering (CF) is one of the most successful algorithms in recommender systems. However, it suffers from data sparsity and scalability problems. Although many clustering techniques have been incorporated to alleviate these two problems, most of them fail to achieve further significant improvement in recommendation accuracy. First of all, most of them assume each user or item belongs to a single cluster. Since usually users can hold multiple interests and items may belong to multiple categories, it is more reasonable to assume that users and items can join multiple clusters (groups), where each cluster is a subset of like-minded users and items they prefer. Furthermore, most of the clustering-based CF models only utilize historical rating information in the clustering procedure but ignore other data resources in recommender systems such as the social connections of users and the correlations between items. In this article, we propose HMCoC, a Hybrid Multigroup CoClustering recommendation framework, which can cluster users and items into multiple groups simultaneously with different information resources. In our framework, we first integrate information of user--item rating records, user social networks, and item features extracted from the DBpedia knowledge base. We then use an optimization method to mine meaningful user--item groups with all the information. Finally, we apply the conventional CF method in each cluster to make predictions. By merging the predictions from each cluster, we generate the top-n recommendations to the target users for return. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our approach in top-n recommendation in terms of MAP, NDCG, and F1 compared with other clustering-based CF models.
