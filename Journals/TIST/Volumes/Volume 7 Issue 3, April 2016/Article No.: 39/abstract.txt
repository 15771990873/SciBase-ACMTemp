Collaborative filtering (CF) models offer users personalized recommendations by measuring therelevancebetween the active user and each individual candidate item. Following this idea, user-based collaborative filtering (UCF) usually selects the local popular items from the like-minded neighbor users. However, these traditional relevance-based models only consider the individuals (i.e., each neighbor user and candidate item) separately during neighbor set selection and recommendation set generation, thus usually incurring highly similar recommendations that lack diversity. While many researchers have recognized the importance of diversified recommendations, the proposed solutions either needed additional semantic information of items or decreased accuracy in this process. In this article, we describe how to generate both accurate and diversified recommendations from a new perspective. Along this line, we first introduce a simple measure ofcoveragethat quantifies the usefulness of the whole set, that is, the neighbor userset and the recommended itemset as a complete entity. Then we propose a recommendation framework named REC that considers both traditional relevance-based scores and the new coverage measure based on UCF. Under REC, we further prove that the goals of maximizing relevance and coverage measures simultaneously in both the neighbor set selection step and the recommendation set generation step are NP-hard. Luckily, we can solve them effectively and efficiently by exploiting the inherent submodular property. Furthermore, we generalize the coverage notion and the REC framework from both a data perspective and an algorithm perspective. Finally, extensive experimental results on three real-world datasets show that the REC-based recommendation models can naturally generate more diversified recommendations without decreasing accuracy compared to some state-of-the-art models.
