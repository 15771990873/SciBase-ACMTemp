Participatory sensing systems can be used for concurrent event monitoring applications, like noise levels, fire, and pollutant concentrations. However, they are facing new challenges as to how to accurately detect the exact boundaries of these events, and further, to select the mostappropriateparticipants to collect the sensing data. On the one hand, participants’ handheld smart devices are constrained with different energy conditions and sensing capabilities, and they move around with uncontrollable mobility patterns in their daily life. On the other hand, these sensing tasks are within time-varying quality-of-information (QoI) requirements and budget to afford the users’ incentive expectations. Toward this end, this article proposes an event-driven QoI-aware participatory sensing framework with energy and budget constraints. The main method of this framework is event boundary detection. For the former, a two-step heuristic solution is proposed where the coarse-grained detection step finds its approximation and the fine-grained detection step identifies the exact location. Participants are selected by explicitly considering their mobility pattern, required QoI of multiple tasks, and users’ incentive requirements, under the constraint of an aggregated task budget. Extensive experimental results, based on a real trace in Beijing, show the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, while comparing with existing schemes.
