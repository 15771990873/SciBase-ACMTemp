While on the go, people are using their phones as a personal concierge discovering what is around and deciding what to do. Mobile phone has become a recommendation terminal customized for individualsâ€”capable of recommending activities and simplifying the accomplishment of related tasks. In this article, we conduct usage mining on the check-in data, with summarized statistics identifying the local recommendation challenges of huge solution space, sparse available data, and complicated user intent, and discovered observations to motivate the hierarchical, contextual, and sequential solution. We present a point-of-interest (POI) category-transition--based approach, with a goal of estimating the visiting probability of a series of successive POIs conditioned on current user context and sensor context. A mobile local recommendation demo application is deployed. The objective and subjective evaluations validate the effectiveness in providing mobile users both accurate recommendation and favorable user experience.
