With the exponential growth of the usage of web map services, geo-data analysis has become more and more popular. This article develops an online spatial data analysis and visualization system, TerraFly GeoCloud, which helps end-users visualize and analyze spatial data and share the analysis results. Built on the TerraFly Geo spatial database, TerraFly GeoCloud is an extra layer running upon the TerraFly map and can efficiently support many different visualization functions and spatial data analysis models. Furthermore, users can create unique URLs to visualize and share the analysis results. TerraFly GeoCloud also enables the MapQL technology to customize map visualization using SQL-like statements. The system is available at http://terrafly.fiu.edu/GeoCloud/.
