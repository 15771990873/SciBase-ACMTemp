Effective representation of image texture is important for an image-classification task. Statistical modelling in wavelet domains has been widely used to image texture representation. However, due to the intraclass complexity and interclass diversity of textures, it is hard to use a predefined probability distribution function to fit adaptively all wavelet subband coefficients of different textures. In this article, we propose a novel modelling approach, Heterogeneous and Incrementally Generated Histogram (HIGH), to indirectly model the wavelet coefficients by use of four local features in wavelet subbands. By concatenating all the HIGHs in all wavelet subbands of a texture, we can construct a nonnegative multiresolution vector (NMV) to represent a texture image. Considering the NMVâ€™s high dimensionality and nonnegativity, we further propose a Hessian regularized discriminative nonnegative matrix factorization to compute a low-dimensional basis of the linear subspace of NMVs. Finally, we present a texture classification approach by projecting NMVs on the low-dimensional basis. Experimental results show that our proposed texture classification method outperforms seven representative approaches.
