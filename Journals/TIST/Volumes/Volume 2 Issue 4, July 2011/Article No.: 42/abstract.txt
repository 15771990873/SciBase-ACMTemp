Aworkflowis a model of a process that systematically describes patterns of activity. Workflows capture a sequence of operations, their enablement conditions, and data flow dependencies among them. It is hard to design a complete and correct workflow from scratch, while it is much easier for humans to demonstrate the solution than to state the solution declaratively.This article presents RECYCLE, our approach to learning workflow models from example demonstration traces. RECYCLE captures control flow, data flow, and enablement conditions of an underlying workflow process. Unlike prior work from workflow mining and AI planning literature, (1) RECYCLE can learn from a single demonstration trace with loops, (2) RECYCLE learns both loop and conditional branch structure, and (3) RECYCLE handles data flow among actions.In this article, we describe the phases of RECYCLE's learning algorithm: substructure analysis and node abstraction. To ground the discussion, we present a simplified flight reservation system with some of the important characteristics of the real domains we worked with. We present some results from a patient transport domain.
