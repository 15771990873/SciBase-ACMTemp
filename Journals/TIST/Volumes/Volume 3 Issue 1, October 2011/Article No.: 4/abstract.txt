Although collaborative searching is not supported by mainstream search engines, recent research has highlighted the inherently collaborative nature of many Web search tasks. In this article, we describe HeyStaks, a collaborative Web search framework that is designed to complement mainstream search engines. At search time, HeyStaks learns from the search activities of other users and leverages this information to generate recommendations based on results that others have found relevant for similar searches. The key contribution of this article is to extend the HeyStaks social search model by considering the search expertise, or reputation, of HeyStaks users and using this information to enhance the result recommendation process. In particular, we propose a reputation model for HeyStaks users that utilise the implicit collaboration events that take place between users as recommendations are made and selected. We describe a live-user trial of HeyStaks that demonstrates the relevance of its core recommendations and the ability of the reputation model to further improve recommendation quality. Our findings indicate that incorporating reputation into the recommendation process further improves the relevance of HeyStaks recommendations by up to 40&percnt;.
