Text mining has been very successful in extracting huge amounts of commonsense knowledge from data, but the extracted knowledge tends to be extremely noisy. Manual construction of knowledge repositories, on the other hand, tends to produce high-quality data in very small amounts. We propose an architecture to combine the best of both worlds: A game with a purpose that induces humans to clean up data automatically extracted by text mining. First, a text miner trained on a set of known commonsense facts harvests many more candidate facts from corpora. Then, a simple slot-machine-with-a-purpose game presents these candidate facts to the players for verification by playing. As a result, a new dataset of high precision commonsense knowledge is created. This combined architecture is able to produce significantly better commonsense facts than the state-of-the-art text miner alone. Furthermore, we report that bootstrapping (i.e., training the text miner on the output of the game) improves the subsequent performance of the text miner.
