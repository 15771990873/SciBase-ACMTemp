Algorithms for constructing hierarchical structures from user-generated metadata have caught the interest of the academic community in recent years. In social tagging systems, the output of these algorithms is usually referred to as folksonomies (from folk-generated taxonomies). Evaluation of folksonomies and folksonomy induction algorithms is a challenging issue complicated by the lack of golden standards, lack of comprehensive methods and tools as well as a lack of research and empirical/simulation studies applying these methods. In this article, we report results from a broad comparative study of state-of-the-art folksonomy induction algorithms that we have applied and evaluated in the context of five social tagging systems. In addition to adoptingsemanticevaluation techniques, we present and adopt a new technique that can be used to evaluate the usefulness of folksonomies fornavigation. Our work sheds new light on the properties and characteristics of state-of-the-art folksonomy induction algorithms and introduces a new pragmatic approach to folksonomy evaluation, while at the same time identifying some important limitations and challenges of folksonomy evaluation. Our results show that folksonomy induction algorithms specifically developed to capture intuitions of social tagging systems outperform traditional hierarchical clustering techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the largest and most comprehensive evaluation study of state-of-the-art folksonomy induction algorithms to date.
