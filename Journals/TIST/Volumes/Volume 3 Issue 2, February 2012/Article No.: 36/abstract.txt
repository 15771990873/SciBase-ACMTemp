Advertising keywords recommendation is an indispensable component for online advertising with the keywords selected from the target Web pages used for contextual advertising or sponsored search. Several ranking-based algorithms have been proposed for recommending advertising keywords. However, for most of them performance is still lacking, especially when dealing with short-text target Web pages, that is, those containing insufficient textual information for ranking. In some cases, short-text Web pages may not even contain enough keywords for selection. A natural alternative is then to recommend relevant keywords not present in the target Web pages. In this article, we propose a novel algorithm for advertising keywords recommendation for short-text Web pages by leveraging the contents of Wikipedia, a user-contributed online encyclopedia. Wikipedia contains numerous entities with related entities on a topic linked to each other. Given a target Web page, we propose to use a content-biased PageRank on the Wikipedia graph to rank the related entities. Furthermore, in order to recommend high-quality advertising keywords, we also add an advertisement-biased factor into our model. With these two biases, advertising keywords that are both relevant to a target Web page and valuable for advertising are recommended. In our experiments, several state-of-the-art approaches for keyword recommendation are compared. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach produces substantial improvement in the precision of the top 20 recommended keywords on short-text Web pages over existing approaches.
