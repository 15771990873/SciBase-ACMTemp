We are building an interactive visual text analysis tool that aids users in analyzing large collections of text. Unlike existing work in visual text analytics, which focuses either on developing sophisticated text analytic techniques or inventing novel text visualization metaphors, ours tightly integrates state-of-the-art text analytics with interactive visualization to maximize the value of both. In this article, we present our work from two aspects. We first introduce an enhanced, LDA-based topic analysis technique that automatically derives a set of topics to summarize a collection of documents and their content evolution over time. To help users understand the complex summarization results produced by our topic analysis technique, we then present the design and development of a time-based visualization of the results. Furthermore, we provide users with a set of rich interaction tools that help them further interpret the visualized results in context and examine the text collection from multiple perspectives. As a result, our work offers three unique contributions. First, we present an enhanced topic modeling technique to provide users with a time-sensitive and more meaningful text summary. Second, we develop an effective visual metaphor to transform abstract and often complex text summarization results into a comprehensible visual representation. Third, we offer users flexible visual interaction tools as alternatives to compensate for the deficiencies of current text summarization techniques. We have applied our work to a number of text corpora and our evaluation shows promise, especially in support of complex text analyses.
