With the prevalence of smart mobile devices with multiple sensors, the commercial application of intelligent context-aware services becomes more and more attractive. However, limited by the battery capacity, the energy efficiency of context-sensing is the bottleneck for the success of context-aware applications. Though several previous studies for energy-efficient context-sensing have been reported, none of them can be applied to multiple types of high-energy-consuming sensors. Moreover, applying machine learning technologies to energy-efficient context-sensing is underexplored too. In this article, we propose to leverage machine learning technologies for improving the energy efficiency of multiple high-energy-consuming context sensors by trading off the sensing accuracy. To be specific, we try to infer the status of high-energy-consuming sensors according to the outputs of software-based sensors and the physical sensors that are necessary to work all the time for supporting the basic functions of mobile devices. If the inference indicates the high-energy-consuming sensor is in a stable status, we avoid the unnecessary invocation and instead use the latest invoked value as the estimation. The experimental results on real datasets show that the energy efficiency of GPS sensing and audio-level sensing are significantly improved by the proposed approach while the sensing accuracy is over 90&percnt;.
