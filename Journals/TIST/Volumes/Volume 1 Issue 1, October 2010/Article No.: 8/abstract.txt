This article introduces an intelligent system that accommodates colorblind users in image search. Color plays an important role in the human perception and recognition of images. However, there are about 8&percnt; of men and 0.8&percnt; of women suffering from colorblindness. We show that the existing image search techniques cannot provide satisfactory results for these users since many images will not be well perceived by them due to the loss of color information. To deal with this difficulty, we introduce a system named Accessible Image Search (AIS) to accommodate these users. Different from the general image search scheme that aims at returning more relevant results, AIS further takes into account the colorblind accessibilities of the returned results, that is, the image qualities in the eyes of colorblind users. The system contains three components: accessibility assessment, accessibility improvement, and color indication. The accessibility assessment component measures the accessibility scores of images, and consequently different reranking methods can be performed to prioritize images with high accessibilities. In the accessibility improvement component, we propose an efficient recoloring algorithm to modify the colors of the images such that they can be better perceived by colorblind users. Color indication aims to indicate the name of the interesting color in an image. We evaluate the introduced system with more than 60 queries and 20 anonymous colorblind users, and the empirical results demonstrate its effectiveness and usefulness.
