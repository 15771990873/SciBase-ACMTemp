Twitter is a popular microblogging service that acts as a ground-level information news flashes portal where people with different background, age, and social condition provide information about what is happening in front of their eyes. This characteristic makes Twitter probably the fastest information service in the world. In this article, we recognize this role of Twitter and propose a novel, user-aware topic detection technique that permits to retrieve, in real time, the most emerging topics of discussion expressed by the community within the interests of specific users. First, we analyze the topology of Twitter looking at how the information spreads over the network, taking into account the authority/influence of each active user. Then, we make use of a novel term aging model to compute the burstiness of each term, and provide a graph-based method to retrieve the minimal set of terms that can represent the corresponding topic. Finally, since any user can have topic preferences inferable from the shared content, we leverage such knowledge to highlight the most emerging topics within her foci of interest. As evaluation we then provide several experiments together with a user study proving the validity and reliability of the proposed approach.
