We understand a sociotechnical system as a multistakeholder cyber-physical system. We introducegovernanceas the administration of such a system by the stakeholders themselves. In this regard, governance is a peer-to-peer notion and contrasts with traditional management, which is a top-down hierarchical notion. Traditionally, there is no computational support for governance and it is achieved through out-of-band interactions among system administrators. Not surprisingly, traditional approaches simply do not scale up to large sociotechnical systems.We develop an approach for governance based on a computational representation of norms in organizations. Our approach is motivated by the Ocean Observatory Initiative, a thirty-year &dollar;400 million project, which supports a variety of resources dealing with monitoring and studying the world's oceans. These resources include autonomous underwater vehicles, ocean gliders, buoys, and other instrumentation as well as more traditional computational resources. Our approach has the benefit of directly reflecting stakeholder needs and assuring stakeholders of the correctness of the resulting governance decisions while yielding adaptive resource allocation in the face of changes in both stakeholder needs and physical circumstances.
