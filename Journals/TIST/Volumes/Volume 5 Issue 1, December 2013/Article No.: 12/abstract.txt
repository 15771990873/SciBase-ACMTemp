Tag recommendation is focused on recommending useful tags to a user who is annotating a Web resource. A relevant research issue is the recommendation of additional tags to partially annotated resources, which may be based on either personalized or collective knowledge. However, since the annotation process is usually not driven by any controlled vocabulary, the collections of user-specific and collective annotations are often very sparse. Indeed, the discovery of the most significant associations among tags becomes a challenging task.This article presents a novel personalized tag recommendation system that discovers and exploits generalized association rules, that is, tag correlations holding at different abstraction levels, to identify additional pertinent tags to suggest. The use of generalized rules relevantly improves the effectiveness of traditional rule-based systems in coping with sparse tag collections, because: (i) correlations hidden at the level of individual tags may be anyhow figured out at higher abstraction levels and (ii) low-level tag associations discovered from collective data may be exploited to specialize high-level associations discovered in the user-specific context.The effectiveness of the proposed system has been validated against other personalized approaches on real-life and benchmark collections retrieved from the popular photo-sharing system Flickr.
