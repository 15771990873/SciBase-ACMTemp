The Social Web is now a successful reality with its quickly growing number of users and applications. Also the Semantic Web, which started with the objective of describing Web resources in a machine-processable way, is now outgrowing the research labs and is being massively exploited in many websites, incorporating high-quality user-generated content and semantic annotations. The primary goal of this special section is to showcase some recent research at the intersection of the Social Web and the Semantic Web that explores the benefits that adaptation and personalization have to offer in the Web of the future, the so-called Social Adaptive Semantic Web. We have selected two articles out of fourteen submissions based on the quality of the articles and we present the main lessons learned from the overall analysis of these submissions.
