In many real-world applications, the same object may have different observations (or descriptions) from multiview observation spaces, which are highly related but sometimes look different from each other. Conventional metric-learning methods achieve satisfactory performance on distance metric computation of data in a single-view observation space, but fail to handle well data sampled from multiview observation spaces, especially those with highly nonlinear structure. To tackle this problem, we propose a new method calledMultiview Metric Learning with Global consistency and Local smoothness(MVML-GL) under a semisupervised learning setting, which jointly considers global consistency and local smoothness. The basic idea is to reveal the shared latent feature space of the multiview observations by embodying global consistency constraints and preserving local geometric structures. Specifically, this framework is composed of two main steps. In the first step, we seek a global consistent shared latent feature space, which not only preserves the local geometric structure in each space but also makes those labeled corresponding instances as close as possible. In the second step, the explicit mapping functions between the input spaces and the shared latent space are learned via regularized locally linear regression. Furthermore, these two steps both can be solved by convex optimizations in closed form. Experimental results with application to manifold alignment on real-world datasets of pose and facial expression demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
