Effective sharing of diverse social media is often inhibited by limitations in their search and discovery mechanisms, which are particularly restrictive for media that do not lend themselves to automatic processing or indexing. Here, we present the structure and mechanism of an adaptive search engine which is designed to overcome such limitations. The basic framework of the adaptive search engine is to capture human judgment in the course of normal usage from user queries in order to develop semantic indexes which link search terms to media objects semantics. This approach is particularly effective for the retrieval of multimedia objects, such as images, sounds, and videos, where a direct analysis of the object features does not allow them to be linked to search terms, for example, nontextual/icon-based search, deep semantic search, or when search terms are unknown at the time the media repository is built. An adaptive search architecture is presented to enable the index to evolve with respect to user feedback, while a randomized query-processing technique guarantees avoiding local minima and allows the meaningful indexing of new media objects and new terms. The present adaptive search engine allows for the efficient community creation and updating of social media indexes, which is able to instill and propagate deep knowledge into social media concerning the advanced search and usage of media resources. Experiments with various relevance distribution settings have shown efficient convergence of such indexes, which enable intelligent search and sharing of social media resources that are otherwise hard to discover.
