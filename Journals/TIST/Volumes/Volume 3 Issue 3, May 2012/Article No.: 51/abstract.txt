Current and proposed remote space missions, such as the proposed aerial exploration of Titan by an aerobot, often can collect more data than can be communicated back to Earth. Autonomous selective downlink algorithms can choose informative subsets of data to improve the science value of these bandwidth-limited transmissions. This requires statistical descriptors of the data that reflect very abstract and subtle distinctions in science content. We propose a metric learning strategy that teaches algorithms how best to cluster new data based on training examples supplied by domain scientists. We demonstrate that clustering informed by metric learning produces results that more closely match multiple scientistsâ€™ labelings of aerial data than do clusterings based on random or periodic sampling. A new metric-learning strategy accommodates training sets produced by multiple scientists with different and potentially inconsistent mission objectives. Our methods are fit for current spacecraft processors (e.g., RAD750) and would further benefit from more advanced spacecraft processor architectures, such as OPERA.
