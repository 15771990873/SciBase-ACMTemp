Twitter displays the tweets a user received in a reversed chronological order, which is not always the best choice. As Twitter is full of messages of very different qualities, many informative or relevant tweets might be flooded or displayed at the bottom while some nonsense buzzes might be ranked higher. In this work, we present a supervised learning method for personalized tweets reordering based on user interests. User activities on Twitter, in terms of tweeting, retweeting, and replying, are leveraged to obtain the training data for reordering models. Through exploring a rich set of social and personalized features, we model the relevance of tweets by minimizing the pairwise loss of relevant and irrelevant tweets. The tweets are then reordered according to the predicted relevance scores. Experimental results with real twitter user activities demonstrated the effectiveness of our method. The new method achieved above 30&percnt; accuracy gain compared with the default ordering in twitter based on time.
