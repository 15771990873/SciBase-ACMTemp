In Web search and vertical search,recency rankingrefers to retrieving and ranking documents by both relevance and freshness. As impoverished in-links and click information is the the biggest challenge for recency ranking, we advocate the use of Twitter data to address the challenge in this article. We propose a method to utilize Twitter TinyURL to detect fresh and high-quality documents, and leverage Twitter data to generate novel and effective features for ranking. The empirical experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively improves a commercial search engine for both Web search ranking and tweet vertical ranking.
