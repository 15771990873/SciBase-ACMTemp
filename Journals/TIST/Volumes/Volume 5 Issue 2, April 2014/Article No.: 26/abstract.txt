One of the main organizing principles in real-world networks is that ofnetwork communities, where sets of nodes organize into densely linked clusters. Even though detection of such communities is of great interest, understanding the structure communities in large networks remains relatively limited. In particular, due to the unavailability of labeled ground-truth data, it was traditionally very hard to develop accurate models of network community structure.Here we use six large social, collaboration, and information networks where nodes explicitly state their ground-truth community memberships. For example, nodes in social networks join into explicitly defined interest based groups, and we use such groups as explicitly labeled ground-truth communities. We use such ground-truth communities to study their structural signatures by analyzing how ground-truth communities emerge in networks and how they overlap. We observe some surprising phenomena. First, ground-truth communities contain high-degree hub nodes that reside in community overlaps and link to most of the members of the community. Second, the overlaps of communities are more densely connected than the non-overlapping parts of communities. We show that this in contrast to the conventional wisdom that community overlaps are more sparsely connected than the non-overlapping parts themselves. We then show that many existing models of network communities do not capture dense community overlaps. This in turn means that most present models and community detection methods confuse overlaps as separate communities. In contrast, we present thecommunity-affiliation graph model(AGM), a conceptual model of network community structure. We demonstrate that AGM reliably captures the overall structure of networks as well as the overlapping and hierarchical nature of network communities.
